Syncronsys [sp?] Software is the maker of SoftRam95, a program that
 supposedly doubled your memory through memory compression and other
 quasi-magical means. It was later revealed that not only did it not
 work as advertised, but it actually did not do anything at all
 (except display graphs indicating non-existant improvements).  IIRC,
 they lost a class action suit over this issue.

I would trust an encryption program relased to the public by the NSA
 more than anything these charlatans released.

I consider PGP to be robust, easy-to-use (with some front-end
 assistance), and secure.  However, I am by no means an authority on
 crypto.
