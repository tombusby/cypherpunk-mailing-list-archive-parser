Sounds like the AUTH_COOKIE module at work again.  Pretty easy to fix.  Just 
comment out the AUTH_COOKIE module (which should not be turned on anyways) in 
the src/Configuration file and recompile.  Keeps people from being cookie-
bombed into the stone age.

AUTH_COOKIE is actually something for excessive user tracking.  It sends a 
cookie for every object sent by the server.  If they have Netscape 3.0 and
are 
tracking such things, it becomes a real pain.  Since few webmasters, if any, 
have log crunchers that will even use that data (or that anyone cares...) it 
is a waste of log space in the first place.  It also annoys many users.
