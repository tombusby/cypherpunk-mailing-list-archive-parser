<sigh> There is a fundamental fact of politics/economics that a socialist
economy and a democratic political structure can not co-exsist.

The concept of property rights is not a flaw but the foundation on which
the constitution and this country is built on. Without the ability to
controll ones own property all other rights fall by the wayside.

I sugest reading "The Wealth of Nations" by Adam Smith for a better
understanding of Capitalism and why it is the *only* economic model that
works for a free society.
