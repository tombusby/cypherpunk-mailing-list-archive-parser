I presume this is a reference to Jim's earlier post:

Of course this same argument could be used to claim that pi is
also rational.  pi =  314159.... / n  (where n=infinity).

What could be the problem here?  One problem might be that an integer
(not including infinity) divided by "infinity" should be 0.

The p/q definition of rational numbers does not rely on "infinity"
being a member of the set of integers.  Also, we rarely hear this
dialogue: "Give me an integer."  "Okay - infinity!"

Still, let's define a set which contains the integers as well as
positive and negative "infinity".  I will call this set the
"Choate-integers."

Let's add some reasonable rules for working with +inf and -inf.  n is
a non-zero positive traditional integer.

a. -inf = +inf * -1
b. +inf * n = +inf
c. +inf + n = +inf
d. +inf / +inf = 1

Operations involving multiplication or division of +inf and zero are
undefined.

Using these definitions, you will find that the p/q definition of
rational numbers operates as expected on the set of Choate-integers.

The argument I supplied earlier for the rational nature of 0.1234...
still holds.
