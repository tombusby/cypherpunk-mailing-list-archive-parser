What the commitment prevents is a birthday attack on the verification
code by Mallet.  Mallet has to be able to come up with a g^x' that
when concatenated with g^y and hashed computes the same verification
code as g^x concatenated with g^y and hashed.

Exchanging commitments to g^x and g^y prior to sending g^x and g^y
severely constrain the the degree of freedom that Mallet has to work
with.  (Another option that works the same way is the "interlock"
protocol, where each side sends half the message (g^x or g^y) and
doesn't send the second half until after receipt of the first half
from the other end).

None of this is designed to provide authentication of the end point.
It is designed to ensure that you've got a private channel to the end
point.

Agreed.  The primary difficulty is getting the public keys into the
unit.  And agreeing on what kind of certificate to use...  
My preference (for patent reasons) would be to use DSA or ElGamal
signatures.
