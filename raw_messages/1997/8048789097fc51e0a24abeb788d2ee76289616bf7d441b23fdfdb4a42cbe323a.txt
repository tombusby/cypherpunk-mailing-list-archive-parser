Hi,

This has to be a first. Usually the central government wants its citizens to
pay taxes. What a novel idea investing our tax dollars this way.

When can we expect to get our dividends as tax payers and therefore inherent
investors in this little enterprise?

Sounds like somebody in the NSA is getting ready to have their collective
butts fried...
