I believe in this sense a DAP system would be a bad thing, but anonymous 
digital contracts in the more direct sense (ie. just a normal 
assasination contract as agreed today in meatspace, but using digital 
cash and other systems to make payments untraceable) are a better option 
as they remove this democratic side to the killings (although the 
democratic method prevents frivolous killings).
I am not at all saying that a person "deserves" to die when enough people 
say they should, but merely describing the situation. It is currently the 
case that when someone becomes A. unpopular enough in public opinion, or 
B. unpopular with someone with a lot of money, they stand a chance of 
being killed for this.

Whoa there! An assasination bot and the hardware it ran on would be 
private property, I can choose to censor whatever the hell I want on 
private property. I personally would not run an AP type bot that 
democratised the process of assasination, as I have said I favour the 
probable outcome of a more direct contract system, but whether I did or 
not it is my decision who I accept bets on. If I choose to only accept 
bets on innocent children and old ladies, that is my own decision on my 
own property. Business suceeds through reputation, remember the basic 
principles of the free market...

ROFL, the very notion of an innocent DEA cop is a joke...
