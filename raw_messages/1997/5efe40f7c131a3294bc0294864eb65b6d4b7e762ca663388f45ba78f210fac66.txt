Information Warfare is no longer just for the military or government. InfoWar is a legitimate concern for the private sector and law enforcement - everywhere. Hundreds of representatives from over thirty countries will interact at
InfoWarCon 6 with world-class presenters in an open-source, unclassified forum to provide workable, real-world solutions to the commercial, legal and technical problems we face.

Over two days, the three tracks and plenary sessions will focus on:

1. Military, Intelligence, Nation-States and Government Contractors. What are their special needs and concerns. Leaders from all areas will bring you current with their
approaches.

2. Cyberterrorism and Crime: Law Enforcement, Domestic, National and International. Case histories and experience from those who know will provide the foundation for solutions and cooperation to a spreading problem.

3. The Private Sector and Commercial Infrastructure: Leading experts on information assurance will provide new models for security, management and infrastructure
protection.
