  Horiuchi shot Mrs Weaver at slightly over 200 meters .... not much o
of a chnace he didn't hit what he was aiming at ... which begs the
question of *wha* was he aiming at?  The rules of engagement
promulgated by Louis Freehs buddy Potts (I think) were nothing more
than a death warrant and I have heard that most of the FBI marksmen
balked at them ... but not good ole 'doin what I'm told to do' Lon ...
yeah right!
