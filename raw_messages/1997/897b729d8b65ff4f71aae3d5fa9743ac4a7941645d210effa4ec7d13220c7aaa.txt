I myself would never escrow my keys to anyone, regardless.  As far as I see it,  giving sensitive things like that to anyone but yourself is asking to be screwed.

Maybe we'll see a ban on assault plungers in a few years.  We may have to register our assault plungers as well.

FWIW, I wish someone would put a bounty on the murdering bastard marines who killed an innocent american defending himself against heavily armed fascists.  If we were half the damn great country we were in the beginning, he'd be plinking with an M-16A2, fu!
lly auto.  So if those bastards even twitched in the dark, they'd be ripped open like the pigs they are.

Government fascism and investigation.

They treat everyone like a criminal organization.

Yeah, an original version still goes underground each night.  It seems to me soon Mr. KlinToon might replace it with a replica, so he can light a joint with it.  "Ahhhh, thar's nuthin' like freedom to light uh joint!"

So remember, in the future, speaking nicely about the cypherpunks may get you a free midnight raid by the military, being used illegally on U.S. soil.

Well, I guess that fascist countries like France, China, Russia, Burma, etc. will consider us bombmakers.

If they aren't shut down and raided first, by freedom and privacy thefting Sons of bitches.

How about a "Defensive Weapons for Remailer users (except for Ratprick Oink)" charity.

So soon people like Phil Zimmerman, who believes in privacy for all, will be raided and stolen in the middle of the night, much like in 1984.

Well, luck be with you and shoot to kill people.

Time to make like Bob Marley and shoot the sheriff.

So now defending your home, something so basic of human rights its unabridgable, the right to live, essentially, is now illegal?  Fuck them all!!

Many fascist god-fearing quivering sheeple feel differently.

It's only dangerous, no, deadly, to fascist freedom-thefters like Freeh and "Flaming Davidian" Reno.  To freedom lovers, it's another tool of freedom, like guns, constitutions, and bombs.  Yes, BOMBS have won freedom, and guns as well.  As long as we excer!
size our right to defend freedom, our current gooberment will continue to crush those rights.  Guns were made for defense, especially towards tyrants.

All the more reason to arm yourself.  If you can't hide, then fortify yourself in your home, armed to the teeth to deter invader maggots like swat teams, Marines and BATF agents.

The best solution?  Nuke D.C., the current constitution, and reinstate the old one, start from scratch.  We've messed up the system, and it's time to start all over again.

Dead bodies of the soulless minions who inhabit fedral buildings, moving us toward Globalism.

A text file:

Using this analogy, the Constitution is the fence, my sovereignty
is my property. The contract has been moved more and more into my
"property". Do I protect the fence? No, I move it back to where it
was. Even if I have to kick my neighbors ass to do it.

But I see it slightly differently. The fence hasn't been moved. It's been
torn down and ripped apart. On my side of the fence is me, my family
and my possesions; including a nice big banana tree.
On the other side of the fence is a 400lb gorilla, just eyeing that
banana tree.
As the fence gets erroded by weather, insects and rodents, the gorilla
is getting bolder and bolder.
My solution is a) shoot the gorilla (100% effective, but somewhat
drastic) or b) rebuild the fence, kill the insects and poison the rats.
So to keep my bananas, I'm forced w/rebuilding the fence, or if that
fails, shoot the gorilla. I'd rather rebuild the fence, as that gorilla
can be mighty entertaining, but if the fence is coming down faster than
I can rebuild it, the gorilla is history.
So I ask you: Can we rebuild the fence or is it time to take aim?

Much like how some schills on the list blasted someone for weeping over the death of McVeigh.

"You can't be serious, he murdered innocent kids!"

"I hope McVeigh fries.  Same to his friend Terry.

I Hope the writer of that fries.  Along with those in government.

Can we rebuild?  I doubt it.

Therefore, sincerely,
