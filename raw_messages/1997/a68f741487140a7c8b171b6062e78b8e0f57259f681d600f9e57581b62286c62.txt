  I guess I am curious about being required to identify yourself ... if 
the cops have no probable cause to arrest you then what right do they 
have to know who you are? ... and should they have probable cause, why 
should you have to help them know who you are. I could see circumstances 
where forcing you to identify yourself would come under 
self-incrimination. I am sure they have ways of dealing with this ... 
what legal precedents are there concerning this?
