                               CRYPTO  '98

            August 23-27, 1998, Santa Barbara, California, USA

                             CALL FOR PAPERS 

                           GENERAL INFORMATION
Original papers on all technical aspects of cryptology are solicited for 
submission to Crypto '98, the Eighteenth Annual IACR Crypto Conference. 
Crypto '98 is organized by the International Association for Cryptologic 
Research (IACR), in cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society Technical 
Committee on Security and Privacy, and the Computer Science Department 
of the University of California, Santa Barbara.  For more information, 
access http://www.iacr.org/

                        INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS
Authors are strongly encouraged to submit their papers electronically. A 
detailed description of the electronic submission procedure will appear 
by December 1, 1997 at http://www.iacr.org/conferences/c98/submit.html. 
Electronic submissions must conform to this procedure in order to be 
considered.  Authors unable to submit electronically are invited to send 
a cover letter and 22 copies of an anonymous paper (double-sided copies 
preferred) to the Program Chair at the postal address below.  Submissions 
must be received by the Program Chair on or before February 16, 1998 (or 
postmarked by February 7, 1998, and sent via airmail or courier). Late 
submissions and submissions by fax will not be considered. The cover 
letter should contain the paper's title and the names and affiliations 
of the authors, and should identify the contact author including e-mail 
and postal addresses. 

Only original research contributions will be considered. Submissions must 
not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors have published 
elsewhere or have submitted in parallel to any other conference or 
workshop that has proceedings. The paper must be anonymous, with no 
author names, affiliations, acknowledgments or obvious references. It 
should begin with a title, a short abstract, and a list of key words, 
and its introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at 
a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. The paper should be at 
most 12 pages excluding the bibliography and clearly marked appendices, 
and at most 20 pages in total, using at least 11-point font and reason-
able margins. Committee members are not required to read appendices, so 
the paper should be intelligible without them.   Submissions not meeting 
these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent to authors by April 
30, 1998. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their
paper will be presented at the conference.

                          CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS
Proceedings will be published in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in 
Computer Science and  will be available at the conference.   Clear 
instructions about the preparation of a final proceedings version will 
be sent to the authors of accepted papers. The final copies of the 
accepted papers will be due on June 5, 1998.
