Something that I've been toying with is setting up an alias that all
of the fools who spam somehow get subscribed to.  Procmail then
filters incoming email for spam.  Rejects are redirected to the alias,
rather than simply /dev/null.  Those that slip through procmail get
"bounced" to the alias.  And, of course, there's always the option of
instead piping the spam to a program that sends the mail to the alias
from one of its own members.

Indeed.
