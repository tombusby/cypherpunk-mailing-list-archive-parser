I was in SoftPro in Burlington (the bookstore) last night and saw they are
having an "Internet Cryptography Seminar" today at 6pm, "featuring Dr.
Richard E. Smith, author of "Internet Cryptography".

I wonder if he'll be digitally signing copies of the book :-)

For help on using this list (especially unsubscribing), send a message to
"dcsb-request@ai.mit.edu" with one line of text: "help".
