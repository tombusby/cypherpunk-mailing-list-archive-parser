	What you need to do to provide FTP access to crypto
software is spelled out in the EAR regulations. Here is a
summary. I am not a lawyer.

1) Users (downloaders) should be asked to answer some
questions to indicate that:

	They are aware of the crypto export regulations.
	They and their computers are in the US/Canada.
	They intend to follow the the crypto export regulations
		and not export the software they download.
	They are US persons as defined in the EAR regulations.

2) The server should check that the client site requesting the
download is in the US or Canada.

In other words, just displaying a warning is not enough.

	I wouldn't try to circumvent the regulations by trying
to follow the letter of the law while ignoring its spirit. You
don't have to be convicted of a crime to make life a lot difficult.
Ask Phil Zimmerman, who never even uploaded pgp to the Internet.
