I found this little gem in today's MSFT press release announcing the 
banks-only certs:

"Dusche [MSFT's financial services industry manager. ed.] also said that
when an announced relaxation of U.S.  electronic-commerce export
regulations occurs this summer, the Microsoft license will be updated to
extend strong security to other financial institutions such as investment,
brokerage and insurance firms, and to make available even more secure key
lengths." http://www.microsoft.com/industry/bank/press/encryptnpr.htm

When did Commerce announce that the regs would be relaxed this Summer? To 
whom did they announce this? Cetainly not to the public, since this is 
the first time I heard about it.
