First off, please let me apologize for this un-intentional "spam."  

(I'll spare you guys the irrelevant argument about whether one letter
constitutes "spam."  The bottom line is it shouldn't have happened, it's
not your fault or responsibility, and you shouldn't have to wade through
_my_ shit over piddling crap like definitions.)

The letter in question was specifically addressed to an address at
msn.com, and I honestly have no idea how it ended up being routed to
dm.com, much less a specific individual's mailbox.  Unless Jim
RoadRunner mis-addressed a reply back to dm.net.  But even there, I'm at
a loss to know how it ended up in Dr. Dimitri's mailbox.  In any case,
it shouldn't have landed there at all.

Btw., thanks Toto for passing this back to me.  It does give us a chance
to change the access password.  And to try to figure out what screwed up
where to make sure it doesn't happen again.

Dimitri - To you I specifically apologize for the inadvertant arrival of
this email in your box.  It was completely un-intentional and, as you
point out, uncalled-for.  Dueling Modems (dm.net) is most definitely NOT
D&M Consulting (dm.com), or any sub-domain housed under their umbrella. 
We're a small online service that Jim has recently joined, and
apparently a confirmation letter or reply was mistakenly routed to you.

Well, not exactly...  <g>

Actually, any EFT information you might pick up would only serve you in
depositing money _into_ Jim's account.

Nice story on the web page, btw.


Again, apologies to all and thanks for being gentle about letting us
know about the screw-up.
