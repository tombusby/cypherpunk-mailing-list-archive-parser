At FC97 <http://www.offhsore.com.ai/fc97/> ;-), we have the following paper
at 10:45 on Tuesday February 22nd:


>     Fault Induction Attacks, Tamper Resistance, and Hostile Reverse
>         Engineering in Perspective
>     David P. Maher (AT&T Labs--Research, Murray Hill, NJ, USA)

I'm not sure whether which side of the fight this paper will be on, but it
could be easy to speculate from the title. :-).

On the other side of the coin, we invited Shamir to come talk about his DFA
work, but eventually it turned out that he couldn't make the trip. Maybe
next year. We *did* get Ron Rivest, though.

(Shameless plug: Our *other* invited speakers are Simon L. Lelieveldt of
the Dutch central bank, who'll talk about the security of electronic money,
and Peter Wayner, the author of "Digital Cash", who'll talk about money
laundering.) (*Really* shameless hucksterism: Since AA *didn't* strike,
they're offering mucho cheapseat deals to places like Anguilla and St.
Maarten, a short ferry ride away, even if you make your reservations on
really short notice. Like, maybe to go to FC97? Nudge, Nudge. We can also
get you *cheap* hotel rooms when you get there... Wink, wink, wink.)

Meanwhile, the FC97 workshop (which runs the week prior to the conference
itself) starts on Monday, and, having weathered the American Airlines
non-strike, Ian Goldberg, Adam Shostack and Gary Howland are now all down
in Anguilla getting things set up. I don't think people can get to *that*
in time, but, hey, you could *try*, I suppose. Better get packing, though,
'cause time is running out. The workshop starts at 09:00 tomorrow.
