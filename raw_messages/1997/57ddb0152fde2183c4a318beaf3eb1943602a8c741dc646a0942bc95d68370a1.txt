Hello,

How are you?

I have found a great way to make an honest and ethical living 
on the internet. I work from home using only a computer and a 
modem and I have very limited computer experience. If you
would like a free report on this business simply read on.

Entrepreneur Magazine voted "INTERNET CONSULTING"
as the #1 business opportunity for 1997!!  Now any 
business or entrepreneur can profit from advertising 
on the internet. 

So why are so few of them doing it? Because they don't 
know how, and there is no one to show them! This has 
created an incredible need for Internet Consultants! 

Within 4 hours of starting my Internet Consulting 
business, I had sold my first ad. Now the requests 
to place orders are flowing in. We've had to hire 
help to process the orders!

What I do is simply show people who are currently
advertising by conventional means, how we can put 
their message in front of over 60 million customers on 
the Internet. 

This is a low start up, easy maintenance, turn key , 
risk free , 100% guaranteed business. This business 
is WHITE HOT!

The time to get in and profit from the INTERNET 
is NOW!

Don't let the opportunity of a lifetime pass you by!
