That slogan was added only fairly recently - I think in the 30's. The
reverse of the Great Seal (the pyramid) has been on the dollar bill only
since the Roosevelt administration, and was almost unknown to the 
average citizen before that.

Nope. While many of the Founders were Masons, by no means all were. 
In particular, there is no evidence that Jefferson was ever a 
member.

The Masons are guilty there too... try reading the entry on 
Freemasonry on Bierce's "The Devil's Dictionary".

Tim is engaging in his traditional hyperbola here - I can assure you 
that he is NOT 34th degree, and I strongly doubt that he is a Mason 
of any shape or form.

Aside from a nit (it's not a temple, but rather a memorial: "The 
George Washington Masonic National Memorial" to be exact), this is 
largely correct. It's a really grand, funky piece of architecture, 
and open to the public, with free guided tours. Over 300 feet tall, 
and on the highest point in Alexandria, it has a *very* impressive 
view from the top, taking in all of DC and miles around.

There's a website at http://www.georgewashington.org. It overhypes 
the site's importance to Masonry, but gives you some views of the 
exterior and interior.

If you're in the area with a couple hours to kill, it's definitely
worth a visit (it's only a few minutes from National Airport). 
Don't miss the bookshop/souveneir stand.

Those in the Silicon Valley area might also want to visit the 
Rosicrucian Museum in San Jose, a similarly funky building,
belonging to an unrelated group.
