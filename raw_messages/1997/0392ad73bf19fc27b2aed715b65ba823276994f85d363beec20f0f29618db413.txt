Dear subscribers to the Cypherpunks list --

	Mikhael Frieden, mikhaelf@mindspring.com, is an alias for Matt
Giwer, a name I hope many of you will recognize.  On the F-C list, he
is now the origin of perhaps 25% of the traffic, as much as 50% some
days, most of which are standard, clueless, trolling, or lying
responses which are designed to suck people into endless replies
like those on what the Anonymizer does or does not do.  William
Geiger writes, "Absolutly, I can't beleive that Mikhael is *that*
clueless."  Well, yes.  When you're trying to troll, you are that
clueless.  We here on the F-C list are hoping to sort of ignore him
and hope he'll go away -- all I see of him are the number of
messages hitting my to-be-deleted folder and the endless replies
cross-posted from cypherpunks.

See:

http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/g/giwer-matt/net-abuse/
http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/g/giwer-matt/

Giwer will even accuse *himself* of lying.

Please do the people on F-C a favor by not cross-posting any replies
that are off-topic for F-C, and hell, while I'm at it, by not
replying to Giwer at all for any reason.  If you're not careful
he'll join cypherpunks.
