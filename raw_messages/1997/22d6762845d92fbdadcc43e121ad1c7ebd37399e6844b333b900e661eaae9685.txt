It "should" work either way. :)

If I went and rented a truck and there was a "roach" in the ashtray I
should not be held accountable for possesion unless it could be proved
that it was mine and not from someone else that had used the truck or even
a worker at the retal shop.

Ofcource if I had the trailer loaded with 100K of coke it would be a
little hard to say that someone else left it there. :)
