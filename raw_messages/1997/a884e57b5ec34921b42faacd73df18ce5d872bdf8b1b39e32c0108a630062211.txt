***************************************************************************
****** The secrets out about the New 18" DIGITAL SATELLITE SYSTEMS *******
***************************************************************************

 The technology underground is an amazing place. The huge multi-national corporations developed the world's most sophisticated satellite-delivered television programming system,called DSS it rolled out in september 1994 and by april of 1995 it had been hacked. 

 By autumn of 1995, Test access cards were being sold all over North America. The cards turn on all programming including pay-per-view-movies,blacked-out sports events and all other available channels.

 These test cards are now being used in other countries to get FREE USA PROGRAMMING on the DSS system. United States companies will not allow other countries to purchase our programming.

 In short companies are popping up selling these cards at a blistering rate. The cards are being sold for as low as 150.00 dollars in some areas, other companies offer two year warranties on thier cards.
