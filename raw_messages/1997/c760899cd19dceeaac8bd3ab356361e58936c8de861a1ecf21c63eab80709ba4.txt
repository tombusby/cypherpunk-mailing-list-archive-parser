  The "About Cypherpunks" intro to the list states,
  "Cypherpunks know how to attack a system and how to defend it."
  "Cypherpunks love to practice."
  If I choose to join the "Venemous Snakes" list, I'm not going to
complain about getting bit every now and again.

  Dr. Vulis? There was an 'attempt' to silence him, but it hasn't 
worked, to date.

  I haven't seen any evidence of an attempt to destroy this list. 
I've seen many attempts to manipulate the list's direction, but
that is another matter.

  There was a crypto-messenger named DataETRetch that 'advanced' their
version of crypto on this list, and they left their heads on the
chopping
block on their way out.
  If your team can't even make it through the scrimmages, then they
don't
belong in the game.  And if you find yourself suggesting, "Why don't we
just play 'touch', instead of 'tackle'.", then you're probably getting
too old and tired to play in the major leagues.

  It doesn't. 'Stopping' the annoyance of these messages promotes 
personal privacy.
