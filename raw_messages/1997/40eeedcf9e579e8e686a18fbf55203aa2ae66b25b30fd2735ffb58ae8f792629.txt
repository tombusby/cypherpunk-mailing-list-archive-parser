How about spam via trusted addresses, 1 out of 10 posts to this list seem
to be ads for something or other. Also what if I decide to subscribe to a
high volume list with a few email accounts and talk my friends into doing
the same. We also decide no to recieve mail from them for free. If we got
over 1000 mails in one day would they have to pay up 100$? and if so who
would they pay it to. People running mailing lists whould have to get
subscribers to verify that they added the list to their trusted address list.
