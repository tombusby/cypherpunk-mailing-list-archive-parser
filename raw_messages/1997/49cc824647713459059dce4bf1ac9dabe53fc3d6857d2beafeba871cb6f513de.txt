The purpose of a remailer is to allow the sender to be anonymous, so
it strips real headers to prevent accidents (eg. subject fields
organization etc).

Then it has to allow you to put headers back in otherwise you can't
interoperate with software.  Eg pasting in References:, Subject: (I
would like to see Cc: and Bcc: being allowed to be pasted in also).

I would also like to see From: pasted in.  In fact I can see no
purpose to restrict what can be pasted in, other than to reduce
complaints to the remailer operator possibly.

It's easy enough to allow From:.  I do it myself sometimes, and notice
Nerthus does also, pasting in From fields works at least with Replay
as the exit node, but that results in two From fields.

My software shows be all headers.  I am not sure what other software
would do, probably, only display the first From field (the remailers).

I would have thought remailers are not actually trying to advertise
their From fields.  Perhaps allowing bogus From fields, or even
putting in remailer@dev.null if there is not a From field would
greatly reduce complaints from clueless users.

If you want to you can always put in Sender: remailer@anon.efga.org.

That'd do.

However you'll notice that my address is:

Amad3us <cypherpunks@cyberpass.net>

which means that I would like it to be pasted in as it is replyable
(for encrypted mail) even though not being a nymserver account.

Not sure that the assurance is this strong.  However the feature would
be useful.
