No shit.  I've been fighting the 'free-thinking' Linux crowd for weeks
on
this.  Just because MSFT sucks is no reason for the gov to start this
shit.
If MSFT sucks, they should be brought to court on those charges, and not
because everyone in the world was stupid enough to use their OS.

Further, just becuase MSFT sucks is no reason to give the gov the power
to regulate software content.  Jesus christ, get out of my pants.

Yes.  This is not a case of "biting the hand that Fed you."  It is a
case
of government power to control a free market.  I don't fear Bill Gates,
I fear the gov.

Who will you fear in 20 years?  Linus?  Give me a break.
