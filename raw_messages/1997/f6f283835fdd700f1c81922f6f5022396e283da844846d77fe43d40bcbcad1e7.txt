I question this, too.  What, exactly, is the criterion?

Cypherpunks charter sez:
The cypherpunks list is a forum for discussing personal defenses for
privacy in the digital domain.  

<Keep in mind I didn't read the described article> How does personal
attacks
through forged and anonymous mail not fit this topic?

However, I _do_ have to say such a topic would have to keep with a 
descriptive attitude, rather than demonstrative...  :-)

On another note, even though some messages which may be of interest may
get lost in the shuffle, I do like the reduced volume, esp. since I get
listmail
at work.  Unfortunately, the reduced mail is a result of censorship...
:-(
