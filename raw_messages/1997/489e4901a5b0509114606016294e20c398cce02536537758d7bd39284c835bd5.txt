Start your own business.  It will take sacrifice, but it can be done.
It doesn't even need to be in your day-job profession, for that matter
-- of the 4 start-ups I've been in, the biggest crash-and-burn was in
the computer business (I seem to think mainly like a "practical
researcher" rather than a businessperson when it comes to computers...).

One of her problems is that teaching is basically a monopoly profession
(a fact we are dealing with in our own family) -- there is no second,
third etc. public school system as an employer.  Another is that she is
living in the confines of New York City, although I would think there
should be places within 60 miles of her ex-husband where the cost of
living should be significantly less.  (In the Indianapolis area, she
could be buying a house on her income -- maybe through a contract sale
by owner rather than through the more common "Realtor" scenario, but
buying a house nonetheless.)

"Chance favors only the prepared mind", Louis Pasteur once said -- we
took advantage of a new local trend 2 years ago, got a guaranteed sale
on our large house (2300 sq.ft. with basement), went to a small house
(1600 sq.ft. without basement), using the money left over to develop
some ground.  (All while helping my mother-in-law cope after my
father-in-law's death.)  There are opportunities out there -- you just
have to look for them.  They may take a lot of your time (so I advise
looking for opportunities that you don't mind or even like exercising at
10pm at night after working a day job and caring for your children), but
they do exist.
