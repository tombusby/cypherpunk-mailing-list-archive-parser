Ecash is in place right now.

This is easily worked out between the remailer operator and the
customer.  Were I running a remailer, I would charge $350.00.  As a
customer, I would not see this as unreasonable.

Each hop should charge, of course.  They are all providing the same
service.

The way to break the concrete link is with blinded credentials.  Of
course, ecash already provides this feature without the hassle of
opening an account with a remailer operator, writing and deploying new
software, etc. etc.
