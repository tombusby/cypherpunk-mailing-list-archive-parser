But the relative present cost of spam (free) is, um, siginificantly, less
than it would cost with e$postage.

Not at all. At the very least, mail from lists I'm subcribed to could come
postage due. And, since I'm the person who's charging postage, sender pays,
remember, I could charge free postage to my friends, like the 1000 or so in
cypherpunks, or the 300 on e$ and mac-crypto. :-).

There are work arounds. Face it, the world is going to specific cash
settled auction pricing on internet services, and not bulk, or even
probabalistic, pricing.

No problem. It'll mean cheaper services in the long run, not only because
someone then owns the "commons", but because efficient autonomously run
cash-settled auctions are always cheaper than transfer pricing and
"planning". It's like comparing the Chicago Board of Trade wheat pit, the
world's most efficient wheat market, to the committee which set Soviet
wheat production quotas. Notice who was selling wheat to whom in *that*
scenario. :-).

Reality, economic or otherwise, is not optional...
