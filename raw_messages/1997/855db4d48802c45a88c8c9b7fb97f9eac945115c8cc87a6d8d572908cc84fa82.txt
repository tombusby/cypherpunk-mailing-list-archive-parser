The boys (and girls) of TRAC do it again:

Date: Wed, 23 Jul 1997 10:18:35 -0400 (EDT)
From: TRAC <trac@MailBox.Syr.Edu>
To: frissell@panix.com
Subject: New TRAC FBI Web Site

	Apologies if this is a repeat message.

	The most comprehensive portrait of how the FBI
enforces America's laws is now available at a new TRAC
site on the World Wide Web. For immediate release. 
Check it out at   http://trac.syr.edu/tracfbi/
	
	Except when the FBI is leaking selected tidbits
about the big case of the day,  the bureau has for many
years been the most secretive of the federal enforcement
agencies.  To a surprising extent -- given all the
headlines -- reporters know very little about the
operations of the federal government's most important
investigative agency.

	What does the FBI do, and not do?  How well does it
do it?  Where does the FBI train its enforcement fire? 
Which sections of the nation have the most FBI
employees?  Maps, charts, graphs, tables, and brief
explaining texts. Drawn from internal administrative
data of the Justice Department, the FBI, and many other
sources.

	In very brief summary, here what's available.

	First,  FY 1992-1996 data on FBI enforcement
actions -- district by district -- for each of the
nation's 90 federal judicial districts.  Referrals,
prosecutions, convictions, median sentences, etc.  Both
actual numbers and appropriate rates.  On a per capita
basis, which districts have the most FBI convictions? 
How does your district compare with other similar ones
and for the nation as whole?  The median FBI sentence in
Maryland (Baltimore)  is eight times longer than Northern
California (San Francisco).  

	How does the FBI compare with the DEA, IRS, ATF and
INS in terms of referrals declined because they were
legally insufficient?  According to the judgements of
assistant U.S.  Attorneys all over the country, not very
well. 

	Second, the FBI has long kept the number of
employees working in different parts of the country
secret.  But here are 1994 FBI staffing levels in each
of the bureau's 55 districts.  Actual numbers and per
capita rates.  The FBI district with its headquarters in
Salt Lake City has more employees per capita than
Detroit and Boston.

	Third, long term enforcement and staffing trends. 
Key changes in what laws the FBI has enforced from 1974
to 1996.  FBI (or the predecessor agency) national
staffing levels from 1908 on -- big spikes during World
War Two, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and President
Reagan's years.

	Fourth.  Ever wondered whether your area might have
a greater potential for white collar crime than other
areas.  Examine that question by comparing the number of
banks, executives, doctors, and other indicators  in
your county with all the others.  Although you can't
count white collar crime, you can count white collars.    

	Again, for immediate release at   http:
