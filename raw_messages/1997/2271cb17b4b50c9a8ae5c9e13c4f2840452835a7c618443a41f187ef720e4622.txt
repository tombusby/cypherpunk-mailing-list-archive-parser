I beleive that this statement refers to the policy enforcement at the SMTP
server. For such a system to work it would have to bounce a message
(according to the policy settings) that was not encrypted with the
corporate key regardless of which version of PGP was used to encrypt the
message.

That would seem possiable but you would also have to override the policy
enforcement at the SMTP server. Without examining the product I can't
comment on what mechinism they have in place.

I think that you have a mix of two things here:

1. Encryption of OUTGOING mail using both the Corporate Key and the
Recipiant Key which can be enforced by SMTP policy agent.

2. A preferance flag in the Public Key to inform the user of a public key
to also use the corporate public key when encrypting. There was
disscussion of making use of preferance flags on the Open PGP list for
things like prefered HASH & Key Use.

I would imagine that they are working from a common code base for all 3
products (shareware, commercial, and business) and merly disable/enable
the various options at compile time. I personally don't mind the code
being there as it lets me see what they are doing in the various versions
(remember Viacrypt never released their source code). I really don't see
this as a problem as it would be quite obvious if the shareware or
commercial version of PGP were adding extra recipiants to an encrypted
message (current PGP format makes this rather hard to hide).

Their seems to be alot of speculation of what PGP 5.5 does or does not do
without anyone actually examining a copy of the program and finding out.
Perhaps a few of us could obtain copys of the program and investegate it
properly. I am willing to boot into NT (shudder) to take a look.

Just as a side note there doesn't seem to be anything PGP 5.5 is doing
that I couldn't get 2.6.x to do with a weekend of codeing. The hard part,
being able to encrypt to multiple recipiants, has been in PGP since day
one.
