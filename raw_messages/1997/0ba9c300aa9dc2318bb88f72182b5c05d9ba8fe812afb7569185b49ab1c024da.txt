And things like purchase orders, contract negotiations, etc., are best
handled by storing in plaintext. Communications security is just that:
_communications_ security, not storage security.

These sorts of items--purchase orders, etc.--will likely exist on employee
machines in plaintext. Or encrypted to the storage key the employee is
using.

(Will PGP for Business deal with this reality in any meaningful way? This
is the real "disaster planning" scenario, that Joe Employee's 4 GB hard
drive is either fully encrypted, or is filled with encrypted files. With
the increasing use of "open landscaping" in offices, machine security in
cubicles is probably  more important than communications security. At Intel
I used to find my machines had sometimes been played with by the nightime
shift....and I'd find sandwich wrappers and Coke cans in my trashcan, and
crumbs, indicating that some swing or graveyard shift worker had used my
office as his own little lunchroom. Were I still working, I'd certainly be
encrypting my files against casual snooping. Or even industrial espionage
snooping. And I wouldn't be using my communications key!)

I agree, but this doesn't seem to be the way PGP 5.5 and its Policy
Enforcer will work. Users (senders from outside, like me) will not have the
options you describe. My private message to Jon Callas will not get through
to him unless I also encrypt to the Security Department's CMR key...and
they may have some interesting questions for him about the content of my
message!

(Yes, as always, companies have the right to demand pretty much anything
they please. No debate there. What we're arguing is the wisdom, on multiple
fronts, of PGP, Inc. building in Big Brother like this.)

I think a boycott of PGP's products is a distinct possibility, from what
I'm hearing.
