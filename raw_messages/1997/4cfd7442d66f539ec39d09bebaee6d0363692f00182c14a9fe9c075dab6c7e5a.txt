I`m finally back on the list, after an absence of about 2 or 3 months, 
but not for long. Circumstances since the machine running fatmans blew 
smoke at me dictated that getting the box running again took a low 
priority amongst the many other things I have been doing recently.

Like I said, I`ll be off the list again soon, maybe just a quick address 
change, maybe a couple of weeks or more whilst I move. Whichever way, you 
can get me at this address now and always get me on +44 (0)410 933 621 
for urgent business.

BTW. Is there anything I should know about that has happened in the 
crypto world since my dissapearance.
