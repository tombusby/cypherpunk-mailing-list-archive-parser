Use hashcash, or even better, digital cash of your chosen currency.

It costs 32 cents to mail a first class letter.  Is it worth paying that to 
send an anonymous email through a chain of a dozen remailers using a Eudora 
plug-in, or a java applet?  For some people it is, if it's made easy to do.

If a thousand people used it each day, that would mean $320 every 24 hours, 
or $116,800 a year to be divided up amongst the 12 remailer operators.  
Similar possibilities exist for remailer pinging services and nymservers.

Why not rewrite Windows?  Call it Secured Windows (or S/Win).  Features 
might include:
	- no swapfile, or at least one that is securely deleted each
	  time the system is shut down
	- automatically overwrite __ times when deleting information
	  from the hard drive
	- digital cash wallet app
	- S/WAN or SSH-type access to ISP
	- library of different encryption apps, including an easy way
	  to quickly encrypt all sensitive files

Initially S/Win would be useful for emerging ecommerce businesses, and also 
companies and individuals handling sensitive data (i.e., accountants, 
lawyers, etc.).  As ecommerce begins to evolve, people doing high-value 
transactions (like buying stocks and other financial instruments) will want 
to know they aren't getting bogus stock ticker prices (a la IP-spoofing) so
they don't unintentionally "sell the farm" at the wrong moment.

Maybe it's a crazy idea to rewrite Windows, but seeing as so many people are 
familiar with it already, why not make it more useful/better/secure?  

When the majority of computer owners realize that their emoney transactions 
can be compromised on an unsecure platform like Windows, they will demand a 
"product" like S/Win.  After all, what good is your personal Verisign 
certificate (a public key) -- not to mention SET -- if the corresponding 
signing/authentication (secret) key can be swiped off your computer by a 
malicious Active X control along with the keystroke sequence of your 
passphrase?
