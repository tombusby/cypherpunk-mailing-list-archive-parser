Russia May Have 'Lost' Nuclear Bombs

By Andrei Khalip

MOSCOW (Reuter) - President Boris Yeltsin's former environmental safety
adviser said in remarks published on Monday that some of
Russia's portable nuclear bombs might indeed be missing, as asserted by
another former Yeltsin aide.

"The statement by Alexander Lebed concerning suitcases with nuclear bombs
is definitely not groundless," academician Alexei
Yablokov wrote in a letter to Novaya Gazeta weekly.
...
He mentioned more than 100 suitcase-sized nuclear bombs, any one of which
could kill up to 100,000 people.

....
The United States said then it had detected a seismic event "with explosive
characteristics" near the Novaya Zemlya test site, but Russian
officials flatly denied any nuclear tests.

They said Russia had voluntarily given up testing in 1992 and was sticking
to this position.

I was unable to attend the Demonstration at NZ, but I am now more willing
to bid for the suitcases than before. They really pack a punch!

I bid $800,000 for Suitcase Number 57.
