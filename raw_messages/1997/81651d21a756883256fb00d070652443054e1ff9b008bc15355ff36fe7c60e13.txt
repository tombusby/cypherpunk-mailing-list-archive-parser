DH is an interactive key negotiation protocol.

El Gamal is the key exchange algorithm used in PGP5.  For some reason
PGP Inc insists on calling El Gamal "DH".  El Gamal is a variant of
DH; so it is related.  But El Gamal is not DH, and it is bad
terminology to call it DH.

The only reason I can think that they insist on calling El Gamal "DH"
at every opportunity is that they perhaps think that the name DH
(Diffie-Hellman) is more widely known, and want to give people warm
fuzzies "oh I've heard of that algorithm".

right.
