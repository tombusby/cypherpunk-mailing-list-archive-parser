Hmmm... must have missed the part about their trespassing.  If
demonstrators trespass (or break any other laws), then they must bear
the consequences of their actions.  To me, the only truly peaceful
demonstrator is one who does not break any laws while demonstrating
(other than laws that stipulate that no demonstrations are permitted
(First Amendment and all)).
