STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION - Worldwide Caution
============================================================
Worldwide Caution - Public Announcement
 November 19, 1997

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Office of the Spokesman


In light of events unfolding throughout the world, U.S. citizens 
traveling or residing abroad are advised to exercise greater than 
usual caution.  Recently there have been numerous incidents and 
developments that have the cumulative potential of impacting the 
security of U.S. citizens, businesses and military interests abroad, 
including the recent convictions of Mir Aimal Kasi and Ramzi Yousef, 
the murders of four businessmen in Karachi, Pakistan, the terrorist 
attack on tourists in Luxor, Egypt, and the general situation in the 
Middle East.

While at this time we know of no specific threats to U.S. citizens 
or interests overseas in relation to the above incidents, we cannot 
discount the possibility of random acts of anti-American violence, 
such as drive-by shootings, kidnappings, or bombings.  U.S. 
diplomatic posts worldwide are taking appropriate security 
precautions.  U.S. citizens planning to travel abroad should consult 
the Department of State's country-specific Public Announcements, 
Travel Warnings, Consular Information Sheets and regional travel 
brochures, and refer to the Department's advisories on security 
awareness overseas.  American citizens residing or traveling abroad 
are encouraged to contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate for 
up-to-date information on security conditions.

This Public Announcement expires December 18, 1997.
