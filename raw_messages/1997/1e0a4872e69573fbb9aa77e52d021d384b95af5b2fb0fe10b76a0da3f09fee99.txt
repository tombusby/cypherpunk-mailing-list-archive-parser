Be wary of the faux freedom advocates who hide behind the 10th.  Duke and
his ilk seek to pull the rug out from under the feds so as to impose their
own version of law on their "constituents": CDA-morality rammed down the
throats of hapless citizens living within the wrong borders.

In many cases, State Sovereignty is just another phrase for the "Petty
Bureaucrats Reempowerment Act": moral dictators hiding behind the flag
of freedom.

As for me, I'll take Individual Sovereignty over State Sovereignty on
any day.  The 9th Amendment states:

 "The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be
  construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."

I leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine what those
"others retained by the people" are.  (hint: I'm not talking about
Civil Rights)

Given the public interest in Court TV and the OJ trials, it seems the US
justice system has become a form of entertainment.  Nothing wrong with
wearing a T-shirt that states the obvious.

How about an interactive TV show called "Kangaroo Court" that lets the
viewers at home be the jury?  "Press 1 to fry him, Press 2 for a slap
on the wrist, Press 3 for ... "
