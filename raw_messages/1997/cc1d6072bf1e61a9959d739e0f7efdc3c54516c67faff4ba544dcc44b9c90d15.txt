This was sent through EFGA's Georgia Cracker Remailer, but seems to
have gotten 'lost' in the remail.
Go figure...

  I was rather surprised when I received a plea for donations from these
people via my subscription to a suicide survivors mailing list. Likewise
when my 10 year old daughter mentioned receiving one through her 4H Club
mailing list.
  Upon asking others at work, I found that these people have been
sending
their requests to millions of people, through every conceivable internet
forum, and that quite a few of the recipients had been taken in, and
sent
them donations.

  In the interests of stopping this obvious scam, I have founded a group
dedicated to wiping out this kind of fraud on the internet, starting
with
the scum at the EFGA.
  If you are interested in contributing to our effort, send donations
to:
	Electronic Fraud Fighters (EFF)
	Box 281,
	Bienfait, Saskatchewan
	  CANADA   S0C 0M0
or email me at:
