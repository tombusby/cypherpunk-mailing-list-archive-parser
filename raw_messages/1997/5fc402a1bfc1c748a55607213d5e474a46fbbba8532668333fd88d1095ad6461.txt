cypherpunks, 

>From my and others' standpoint at Sandia, NSA, FBI, and NIST are
only interested in crypto from a business standpoint.

They want the taxpayer to support their business interests.

Some of us at Sandia kicked back.

Title: William H. Payne - Arthur R. Morales Documents






Revised 16 August 1997

21 June 1997

  

  WILLIAM H. PAYNE  - ARTHUR R. MORALES DOCUMENTS



  
    
      These documents pertain to a suit by cryptographer William
	H. Payne and Arthur R. Morales against the National Security Agency
	 (NSA) and related complaints by Payne against his former employer Sandia
	National Laboratories (SNL or Sandia), US Department of Energy, and federal
	officials. Sandia performs contract work for NSA, part of which involves
	cryptographic systems for nuclear weapons controls.
	
	Payne worked on classified cryptographic systems at Sandia. He is a
	noted scholar, scientist and author of cryptography and computer programming
	books and articles.*
	
	The documents describe Sandia's termination of Payne for alleged security
	violations, Payne's defense against the security violation charges, and Payne's
	counter-charges against Sandia and NSA of wrongful termination for criticizing
	NSA's cryptographic deficiencies and other cryptography-related misdeeds.
