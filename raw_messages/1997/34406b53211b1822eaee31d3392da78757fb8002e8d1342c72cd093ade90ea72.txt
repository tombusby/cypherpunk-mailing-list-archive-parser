The main mistake in the argument that you cited is the following:
it assumes that you know the cost of hacking and reading one's email
or files.

You do NOT know it. Moreover, while it is usually easy to find the upper
bound for that cost, the lower bound is not so obvious. Recall the 
latest attack on INN servers, when one trivial message (see below) could
be used to compromise thousands of internet sites, at the negligible
cost.

It is only safe to assume that the cost of breaking into a Unix system
(or any other server for that matter) is ZERO.

Unix security on multiuser machines is an oxymoron, it does not exist
and should never be assumed.

The problems with people actually securing their communications and
personal data are as follows:

1) It is costly to set up a more or less secure system (ie, a system
that is not a server and that is somewhat protected from various data
attacks) because of learning curve and other costs

2) Many if not most correspondents are so clueless they's never even 
understand what they need to do to secure their communications.

I had to drop several conversations with people because they were 
stupid/lazy enough not to set up PGP.
