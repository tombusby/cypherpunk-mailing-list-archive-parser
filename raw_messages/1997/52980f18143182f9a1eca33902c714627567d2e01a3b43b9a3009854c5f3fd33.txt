Dear Mr. Robert Hettinga,

This is Tsuyoshi Hayashi, one of subscribers of the
cypherpunks list, lives in Yokohama, Japan.

I heard today's your voice on the cypherpunks list.  I am
little sad.

I am almost ROM, read-only member...  Although I have been
hear for two and a half (wow..) years, I posted only three
(or four...) messages.  I am a bad boy.
Sorry. > all

Instead of it, I have gotten many many cripto-concerned
info (such as PGP) which are worth reading (though they
are very difficult for me, both technical and language ;-).
Today I know about cryptography a little.  I am working
nearby the cryptographic field in Japan.  So I DO want to
say THANKS to all subscribers of the list and the
owner-cypherpunks@toad.com, and the host machine named
toad.com [140.174.2.1].

I found your DCSB list out about a month ago.  This list
is also interesting for me.  Thanks.

I did want to go to FC97, but there is a long distance
between Anguilla and Japan...  I hope you will post the
summary and/or topics of FC97 to the DCSB. :-)

Mr. Bob Hettinga and all, doumo arigatou gozaimashita!
