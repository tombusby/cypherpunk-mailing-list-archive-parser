Take a look at

	http://rs.internic.net/arin

for a quiet bombshell, especially Section 2.3.  A Class C block
for $2,500?  If you think that isn't funny there are a few
people that agree with you in threads elsewhere.  Try a dejanews
search on $2500 Class C.  You might also want to take a peek at

	http://www.iahc.org

for news about a commentary period that ends in the next few
days.

I've since heard that their contract run out in 1998, now since they have gone 
from a small nothing company to a widly known disaster, if follows that they 
are making money hand over fist. So before  the contract opens we need to make 
enough noise with the goverment that the contract is NOT relet to them but 
rather to open bid, or to a true non profit alliance of Internet professionals 
to provide the service at cost (which in reality is quite small). Only we can 
make the difference.
