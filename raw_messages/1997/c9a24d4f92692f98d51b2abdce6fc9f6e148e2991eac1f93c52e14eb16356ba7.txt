In this week's special Censorship Issue Shift Control...

"The US is decidedly more robust about censorship. For starters, any art
using the American flag is banned automatically (it's in the Constitution,
alongside all that stuff about freedom of speech)." - Lisa Jardine on
Western "liberalism".

"In the movies,as in advertising, cars have played a strategic role
sex-wise: when Hollywood rotated the gender wars through 180° in 'Thelma
and Louise', it was female possession of the car - and of driving skills -
that became the dominant and ultimately liberating motif." - Robin Hunt on
Cronenberg's 'Crash'.

"Fans of the 'Eastenders' will never forget last year's Blackpool episodes,
which reached a riveting climax when Tony, the sexually confused ex-drug
dealer, kisses Simon - his pregnant girlfriend's brother. Great stuff, but
viewers were actually prevented from witnessing the full smacker. New BBC1
controller Michael Jackson made a last-minute decision to cut the kiss down
from a lingering two-second smooch to a measly half-second peck." Paul
Robinson on the history of censorship.

Plus our new daily film section, a pre-millennial global singalong, Freebee
the animated bee, the coolest shoes in the world, free books and CDs, and
your last chance to win 200 quid in our fiction competition.
