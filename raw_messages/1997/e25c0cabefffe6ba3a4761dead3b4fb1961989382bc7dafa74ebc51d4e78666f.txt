  What a hypocrytical crock of shit.
  Are you concerned that your pal, Hallam-Baker, won't be able to 
"testify" against me when the Feds kick in my door as a supporter
of Jim Bell?

  TruthMonger is a multi-user Net persona, meant to be used
for that very reason.
  It is handy for lessening the ability of others to refuse to
deal with presented facts and logic, instead choosing to 
attempt refuting opinions through grand pronouncements as
to the writer's position in an imaginary elitist reputation 
capital scheme.

  I have a persistent net persona. It's in your killfile.

  Either get your head out of your butt and learn to accurately
read and/or interpret the statements of others, or get a job
at C2Net.

  There seems to be a tendency by some on the list to dismiss 
the posts of others by labeling them a 'loon' or somesuch 
derogatory term, rather than  addressing their logic and 
message, per se. 
  The fact that Bell tends to beat the AP drum ceaselessly may
make his repetiveness boring, but in no way makes his system
less valid than more mainstream methodologies. There is hardly
anyone on the list whose missives don't occassionally skip
like a broken record, but they are not labeled lunatics as 
long as they stay in the middle of the road. 
  (You might say that Bell has a "persistent net persona.")
