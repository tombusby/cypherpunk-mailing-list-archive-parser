"Posting ONLY anonymously"?  Wherever did you get that idea?  If you really
believe that this "anonymous asshole" is "posting only anonymously", then
your previous accusations that someone else on this NG (who posts 
NON-anonymously) was this person were a LIE, weren't they?  So which of your
two contradictory statements is the lie?  Or are they BOTH lies?  They can't
both be true.

You just did.  When you have to single out alleged "assholes" as being black, 
gay, Jewish, anonymous, Italian, or whatever, you reveal your own prejudices 
against that group.  For example, you never hear a white person say, "That 
white bastard just cut me off" while driving, do you?  Such language is usually 
reserved for groups you HATE.  For all your recent backpedalling and sucking 
up, your stance on privacy, anonymity, remailers, etc. remains quite clear.

"Could have" equals "proof" in DataBasix-speak?  (You did just move to the
part of the country where burning alleged "witches" was once a popular
pasttime, didn't you?)  Remember that you're the person CLAIMING that this 
alleged abuse even occurred, so the burden of proof is on you.

If everyone bought into that attempt at "logic" (assuming your conclusion as
part of your argument),  we'd have no need for jails, would we? <g>  It could 
become the universal response to "where were you on the night of XX/XX/XX?"

> You on the other hand apparently feel you need to hide.

Bovine excrement.  Concealing one's name and e-mail address is no different
conceptually from concealing one's home address or phone number.  So if you
truly have nothing to hide, please feel free to post that information, or else
shut up about having nothing to hide.  If you have nothing to hide, why are
you so afraid of people reading your posts via from DejaNews that you cloak 
each one with that No-Archive header?  I remember when you once criticized a
fellow poster for "hiding behind" it, and now you're doing the same thing you
criticized him for!
 
> It's obvious to me and to many that you want to cause damage to the remailers.

"Obvious to me" does not constitute proof.  I posted Jeff's account of
YOUR anti-remailer activities.  He mentioned you and Belinda Bryan BY NAME.
When you have similar evidence against someone else, naming names, please post 
it.  You have yet to demonstrate that this mythical monster you're expecting 
others to believe exists is anything other than your own self-serving creation.
It reminds me of what one philosopher said about the devil -- "if he didn't
exist, we'd have to create one".

Huh?  The "evidence" was posted by YOU and the analysis came from Sam.  I
wasn't even in that loop.  Nice try.
