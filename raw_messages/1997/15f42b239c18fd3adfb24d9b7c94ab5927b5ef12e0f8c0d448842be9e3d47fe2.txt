alt.cypherpunks has been newgroup'ed, and I belive rm'grouped. Smart,
consiencous newsadmins probably did not honor the rmgroup, as
alt.cypherpunks should be acceptable, but most newsadmins are too
overworked to actually look at most of the crap that comes through.
For example, it hasn't received any messages on my news server,
probably because the one upstream removed it. 

Therefore, it would be a Good Thing to continue any discussion on
alt.config, and convince any cabal'ers who rmgroup it to re-new it.
Sending out boosters every couple of weeks wouldn't hurt, either. 

alt.cypherpunks'less,
Jer
