True, but an encrypted tunnel to fetch your e-mail will at least
render wiretaps on your phone-line useless. While that doesn't
really matter if all your e-mail is PGP-encrypted, the truth is that
a lot of e-mail is still in the clear. That at least would be
protected to a degree...

Btw., does anybody know if there's an crypto-enhanced direct-dial-up
program such as minicom out there?
