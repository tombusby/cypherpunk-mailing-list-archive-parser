If your decision to sue or not sue is based on the deepness of the
defendant's pockets, and if you didn't know this until after he was
identified, then you very might well end up tracking down and
identifying someone that a lawyer wouldn't be willing so sue (on a
contingency fee basis), right?

My question was, if Politas' suggestions were implemented and an
unknown individual was tracked down using the procedure he outlined,
and it turns out the individual was "judgement proof", who's going
to pay for the costs of the investigation?

Otherwise, you end up with an "in terrorem" remedy.  That's one that
you probably wouldn't or couldn't aqctually use, but the potential
to do so might serve as a deterrent.  Unfortunately, when free
speech is involved, that's exactly what many of us don't want.  It
cuts both ways.  Look at what the scientologists did to Julf and the
anon.penet.fi remailer.  Alleging some violation of Swedish law,
they almost succeeded in retrieving Julf's entire "traceability"
database linking account names to their "real" owners.  The end
result was that the remailer was destroyed.  Having privacy invading
data like that available put all of Julf's clients at risk.  In the
end, Julf felt that it was better to close down rather than risk
future raids.

That has pretty much driven a nail in the coffin of the sort of
"traceable" remailers Politas is now proposing.  It's a case of
"been there -- done that".  Few people relish ending up on the
Scientologists' (or the next organization like it that comes along)
hit list, and most now realize how vulnerable a remailer operator is
to coercion -- even the "legal" variety.  One doesn't even have to
be an anti-scieno to be a victim of such a raid.  Since they're so
paranoid about anonymity and the ability of people to publish their
"secret scriptures" anonymously, they might just steal such a
database and anonymously publish it themselves.  Outing thousands of
innocent remailer clients would irreparably harm the reputation of
remailers, which would work to their advantage.

I'll even go so far as to say that you'll never be able to eliminate
truly anonymous remailers.  First of all, you'll never get every
single country to adopt Politas' suggestions.  All it takes is one
untraceable remailer in an encrypted chain to make back-tracing a
message impossible (or at least prohibitively costly, in terms of
money, time, and computing resources).

That's one option, but I wouldn't make it a blanket suggestion.
Some ideas are worth defending and some are better off dropped.
I've seen fanatics on some NGs who have attracted exactly ZERO
supporters to their position, and dozens of people rebutting,
flaming, ridiculing them, etc. yet these folks persist.  Ultimately
it's their choice.

Let me cite an example.  I believe the earth is round and presumably
you do too.  But if you visited a NG that was the hangout of dozens
of flat-earthers, you probably wouldn't stick around too long to
argue the point.  At least I know I wouldn't.  Being right doesn't
require you to convince everyone.  You just accept the fact that
some arguments are unwinable and move on to more productive things.
The same could be said for religious or political flame wars.

If I expressed my opinion, and some religious kook accused me of
being the devil incarnate for espousing such heresy, I wouldn't
waste my time trying to netcop the person.  Maybe calling me "the
devil incarnate" is libellous, but IMO it's not worth the time and
effort to pursue.  And that's even with a net.kook who's posting
with a genuine e-mail address and his "real name".  An anonymous
kook is even less worthy of bothering with.

If he crosses the line and commits behavior that is flagrantly
illegal, then he's exposing himself to risk by doing so.  Let's face
it, people may walk down the street with ski masks on, and even if
it annoys you, you're probably not going to be able to unmask them.
If one robs a bank, though, he stands a far greater chance of being
identified and apprehended.  Politas' solution is like requiring
name tags on ski masks.  Let's worry about the bank robbers rather
than the people who wear ski masks.

The bottom line being, if you have a POV you wish to express, and
you encounter opposition in one forum, choose another one.  If you
can't find one, start one.

If he's posting anonymously, then he's easily killfilable.  Just put
the return address of the remailer(s) he's using in your killfile.

If he's not posting anonymously, then that scenario is not related
to remailers.  If you're talking about multiple GENUINE IDs, then
the ISPs involved might be able to help -- assuming he's really
committing abuse OF the net, and not merely being annoying.  If
they're bogus IDs, then his ISP might have a policy about that as
well.

Again, that's a choice you have to weigh.  Take each remailer ID and
decide whether the valuable posts from that ID outweigh the junk.
But, again, annoying posts aren't really what Politas' proposal
dealt with.  He was talking about actual laws being broken.

If you had a matter that truly concerned the police, the lack of a
suspect's name shouldn't hinder you.  After all, if someone had
stolen your car, you'd report it even if you didn't know who did it,
wouldn't you?  As I said previously, many bank robbers are caught
even if they wore masks or drove a car without license plates.

> I think he wants one particluar person to leave him alone.

I must have missed that point in following the thread.  If I recall
correctly, I asked him what particular problem he was trying to
solve, since it's easier to solve real, existing problems that
hypothetical ones.  He said that he didn't have any problems like
that himself, and doubted he would because he didn't normally engage
in behavior that would attract enemies, but he was concerned that it
might happen to others.

[Politas:  please feel free to jump in and clarify this point.]
