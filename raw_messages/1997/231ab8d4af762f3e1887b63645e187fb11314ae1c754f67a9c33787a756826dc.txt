Gosh, Declan, isn't Mike Nelson's endorsement a bit awkward
for an fight-censorship list? Not to mention his show and slather
the host at your do?

That's assuming your bash was not a Time-reimbursible. If
it was, then the WH rub-down and suck-up fits, and may god 
deliver the heaven-on-earth reward: White House Correspondent,
spin navvy to the free world leader.
