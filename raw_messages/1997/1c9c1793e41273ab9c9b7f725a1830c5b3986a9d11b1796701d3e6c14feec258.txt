 In> Clinton Admin. To Offer Encryption Bill Shortly

 In> WASHINGTON - The Clinton administration plans to introduce
 In> legislation soon that would clearly affirm that encryption users in
 In> this country are free to use any type or strength of encryption
 In> technology, a senior administration official said.

 In> Currently, no such explicit law is on the books.

Obviously, by making a law, that strangely enough tries to legalize,
what is legal already, the administration is trying to bait people
into "voluntary" key escrow, which are in my opinion the actual main
points of the law...

 In> The bill also would:

 In> -- Spell out the legal conditions for the release of "recovery
 In> information" to law enforcement officials. The bill also provides
 In> legal safeguards for third-party "key recovery agents" who have
 In> properly released such information.

etc.etc...

What a bunch of bullshit. Now, that the backdoor "Clipper" doesn't
