Hi Bob,

stypid question: how to I post a message to
the Cypherpunks. I have an announcement on
a new method to fight junk e-mail, which has
been integrated in LPWA (nee Janus).
See below

Best,

Hi,

we are Bell Labs researchers announcing a method to help you combat
junk e-mail (spam) via a new kind of e-mail address, termed a target-revokable
e-mail address. Every time you give out your e-mail address, e.g., when you
register at a Web-site or post to a Usenet newsgroup, there is a risk that
your address will end up in the hands of an e-mail a marketeer or spammer.
Until now, you had no way to undo giving out your e-mail address.
Target-revokable e-mail addresses effectively let you do that.

Currently, most e-mail users typically have a very small number of e-mail
addresses. For example, one at the office and one for private use with an ISP
at home. In contrast, the principle behind target-revokable e-mail addresses
is that each user has many e-mail addresses. In fact, users can have a
different e-mail address for each group or entity with whom they interact.
Furthermore, target revokable e-mail addresses are defined such that a
recipient of such an address cannot guess other target-revokable addresses
belonging to the same sender and destined for different groups.
Target-revokable e-mail addresses have been integrated with LPWA for easy
use with Web sites and Usenet newsgroups (more application to follow at a
later date).

The Lucent Personalized Web Assistant (LPWA, formerly known as Janus) is a
new tool that provides you with privacy, convenience and security when
browsing the Web. LPWA is having a highly successful test run,
having won PC Magazine "Developer's site of the Week Award".
