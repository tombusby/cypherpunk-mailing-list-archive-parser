I live in Oklahoma.  Here at least, bartenders don't sell beer to minors,
they sell it to persons who are clearly older.  Older friends of the minors,
and minors who finished puberty early.  The bartenders only protection is to
close up shop, depriving everyone of a drink.
The same is true of tobacco products.  About 8 months ago I had a girl who I
barely knew, except that she was obviously in Junior High, recognize me, ask
me if I was 18, to which I replied yes, and ask me to buy her a carton of
cigerettes, to which I declined.  Not for any law imeding me, but I consider
suicide a right, but I will not help someone kill themselves.  This girl,
more than likely already hooked on the drug, had probably used this
technique numerous times before without a glitch.
The same would be true of blockingon-line content.  If it were done right.
