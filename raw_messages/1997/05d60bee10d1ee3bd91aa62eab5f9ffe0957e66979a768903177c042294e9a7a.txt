C'punks,

Adam has assembled a pretty good history of recent events.  The
following comments only cover some of the issues raised by Adam.
It should not be assumed that I agree with all the statements
upon which I do not comment.  I have limited myself to commenting
on only a few issues with which I am in dispute.

Moderation was my suggestion, but the moderation policy was not.
My suggestion was quite different.  In a nutshell I wanted to:

	a.  Limit posts to list members only.
	b.  Promote civility on the list by applying sanction to
	    list members who repeatedly flamed or otherwise 
	    breached civil decorum.
	c.  Provide for anonymous or non-member posts by having
	    volunteers act as "gateways" who would forward 
	    anonymous--but civil--posts to the list.

Curiously, in a subsequent telephone conversation, Tim May 
proposed almost that exact suggestion as an alternative form of
moderation that he said would have been acceptable to him.  Go
figure.

Absolutely false.
