 Pearl Harbor Computers has announced the "PGP Crack Challenge" with
a prize of $10,000.00 for the first person to decrypt a PGP cyphertext
file which reveals the location of the Jews being hidden by anarchistic
CypherPunks.

  Despite the best efforts of the U.S. legislative bodies and secret
government comittees, the danger remains that outlaw cryptographers
will be able to illegally avoid future Government Access to Keys
legislation and prevent law enforcement agencies from being able to
read their communications through use of strong, non-GAKed crypto.
  Imagine the burden that would have resulted if strong crypto had
prevented the German Gestapo from accessing information needed to
meet the legitimate needs of law enforcement during World War II.

  Pearl Harbor Computers will post a file called "hidejews.asc" to
the CypherPunks list in the near future. It will use 2048 bit PGP 5.0
encryption signed with Pearl Harbor Computers secret key.
  In order to win, whoever decrypts the message must post their results
to the cypherpunks list, signed by their secret key.
  The $10,000.00 prize will be paid in the equivalent of removed gold
tooth-fillings held in escrow in safety deposit boxes in a secure Swiss
bank.

C.J. Parker,
President,
Pearl Harbor Computers
