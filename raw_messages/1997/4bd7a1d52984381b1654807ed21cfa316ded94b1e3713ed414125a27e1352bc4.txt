> A NEW THEORY OF NMR FOR EXTENDED OBJECTS. 
> Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) isn't just an imaging

> chemical environment and structural layout of atoms in different
> environments. This is because the NMR spectrum of an atom (or
> to be more precise, the spectrum of the atom's nuclear magnetic
> states) is different depending on the local geometry, just as an
> atom's allowed electron energies will be different if the atom is

> isolation. Now, physicists at UC Berkeley (Steven Louie,
> louie@jungle.berkeley.edu, 510-642-1709) have devised a
> method which for the first time makes possible rigorous
> calculations of the NMR spectra of extended systems such as
> crystals, surfaces, polymers, or even amorphous materials; given
> the coordinates of the atoms, the Berkeley researchers were able
> to predict the spectrum. They tried out their theory on an
> industrially important material---synthetic diamond films used,
> for example, as coatings for tools and engine parts.  The

Hell of a way to reverse-engineer just about anything. How long you figure
it will be before they start coming out wit industrial units just for
materials analysis?  I wonder how good it would be at determing the layout
of a die through the carrier...

Pretty nifty materials analysis tool. Maybe they should shoot the atom toward
the NMR...

> FISSION HELPS SUPERCONDUCTIVITY.  One of the

> the wire sample. Scientists working at Los Alamos have now
> used a proton beam to induce nuclear fission in mercury atoms in
