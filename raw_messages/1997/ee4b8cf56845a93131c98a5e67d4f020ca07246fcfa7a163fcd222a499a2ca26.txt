Some interesting hits for "data embedding" on IBM's patent server page...

http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/details?patent_number=5671277
ISSUED: Sep. 23, 1997
FILED:  Oct. 21, 1994
Snip of abstract:  Additional data useful for the management of copies 
of a document for an image forming apparatus is embeddedin a hard 
copy of the document. The additional data is embedded in an inherent 
image of a document as pixels arranged in a prescribed format, and,
preferably, the size of the pixels is such as to not be easily 
recognized with the naked eye. 

http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/details?patent_number=5659726
ISSUED: Aug. 19, 1997
FILED:  Feb. 23, 1995
ABSTRACT:   A method of embedding auxiliary information into a set of host 
data, such as a photograph, television signal, facsimile transmission, or 
identification card. All such host data contain intrinsic noise, allowing 
pixels in the host data which are nearly identical and which have values 
differing by less than the noise value to be manipulated and replaced with 
auxiliary data. As the embedding method does not change the elemental 
values of the host data, the auxiliary data do not noticeably affect the 
appearance or interpretation of the host data. By a substantially reverse 
process, the embedded auxiliary data can be retrieved easily by an 
authorized user. 


The patent office needs a fucking clue server. Hmmm... wonder if I can get a
patent for one?
