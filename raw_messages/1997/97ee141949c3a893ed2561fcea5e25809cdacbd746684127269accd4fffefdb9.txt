 Said syllogistically,

 Digital Commerce *is* Financial Cryptography,
 Financial Cryptography *is* Strong Cryptography,
 therefore,
 Digital Commerce *is* Strong Cryptography.
 and therefore,
 No Strong Cryptography, no Digital Commerce.


 Instructions for the use of this syllogism:

 Invite 'em to a presentation.

 Use one proposition per slide, with nothing on the slide but the
 proposition, centered vertically and horizontally. Don't make handouts.

 Put up the first slide, and defend the proposition.
 Repeat until last slide.

 Ask for questions.

 The bill is in the mail. ;-).

 QED,
 RAH
