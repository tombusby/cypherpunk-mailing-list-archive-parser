My first thought is.. which country are you talking about?

The question is a complex one.  The first question is, what is meant by a
signature?  Courts have rules that valid signatures include and "X",
spitting on the document, and signing "Mickey Mouse" (an actual case).
Even a "/s" at the end of a document would constitute a signature.  

The second question is of more concern.  Signatures are linked in law to
"writings."  In order to consider a digital signature, you must first
define the concept of a "writing."  Is electronic mail or an electronic
document a writing?  Is a facsimile copy a writing?  Recently, a US based
state level supreme court ruled that faxes were not writings, but rather
were "beeps and chirps".  Since faxes are not writings, a faxed signature
was ruled to not be a valid signature anywhere within the state.

This is a problem that digital signature law must consider.  How to make an
electronic document a writing.  Currently states are doing so by passing
laws that explicitly define electronic documents as writings.
