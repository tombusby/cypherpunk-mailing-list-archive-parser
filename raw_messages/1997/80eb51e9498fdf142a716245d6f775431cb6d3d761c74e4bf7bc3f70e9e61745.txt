As I understand it, Mondex is a completely closed system. Everything that 
you don't absolutely need to know is undocumented. Since you can settle 
offline, the potential for fraud is frightening; unless I'm getting the 
benefit of these, um, weaknesses in the system, I don't want there to be 
any. The lack of privacy seems to be somewhat of a smokescreen; since you 
can settle offline, they don't have a really accurate way of tracking 
transactions except at the interface between e$ and other forms of money 
or goods (like their POS terminals and ATMs).

Can you hack Mondex? They say you can't...
