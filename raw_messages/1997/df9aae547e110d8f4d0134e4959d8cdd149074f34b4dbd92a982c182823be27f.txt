Duh.

They don't seem to realize yet that it is about as easy to run a website 
hosted 5000K away as one down the street. This is fundamental. Some 
countries =will= attempt to regulate this commerce. I would be absolutely 
amazed if this were not so. The wonderful thing about this though is that 
it is just too damn easy to move a web site offshore to a location more 
friendly to commerce, so they will ultimately fail. The bad part about this 
is that there are few, if any restraining forces on government action in 
most places. Therefore, it is likely that any attempts to regulate internet 
commerce will be enforced for far longer than any person with a brain would 
continue to do to. Additionally, many companies will cave to the demands of 
whatever the jack-booted thugs demand so as to avoid harassment.

The last 4 words here are what is important. Why they think things will get 
better for them is beyond me. The ability to route around damage (in this 
case, taxes) is the strong point of the net. With any luck, this will 
continue to be true.

Again, DUH.

Yet.

Don't you just love the way they try to make confiscatory taxes seem like 
the most natural and patriotic thing in the universe? <:)
