That's becoming old hat with the censorious control freaks.  If they don't 
like what's being posted anonymously, the post a whole bunch of anonymous 
"abuse" themselves, then turn around and demand that "something to be done 
to stop this abuse".  It's gotten remailers banned from posting through 
certain mail2news gateways, and even gotten remailers (like Mailmasher,
Huge Cajones, and Lucifer) shut down entirely.

In many cases, it's not hard to figure out who's doing it.  Just look for
posts where anonymous posters are called "anonymous assholes", accused of
"hiding behind the skirts of a remailer", etc.  For info on the attack on
Jeff Burchell's remailers, visit:

If you'll visit the "control" NG, you'll find see that <news@news.msfc.nasa.gov>
is forging a lot of cancel messages to kill anonymous posts.  Perhaps a
complaint to NASA is in order to protest government computers being used
for forgery. And if someone is also forging a NASA address to make them look
bad at the same time, then they need to know about that, too.
