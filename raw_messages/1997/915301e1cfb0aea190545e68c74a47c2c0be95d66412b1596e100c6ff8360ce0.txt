Since the damn things are used for ID and secret shared keys, etc. doing 
so would fuck up your own privacy.  If you're gonna do that, encrypt it 
first. :)

I do that all the time at work when we take a new system and install it 
so it can be sealed. :)

Yeah, well, the other day I was talking to someone about pissing in the 
water supply too...  Birds that fly over it, do it all the time.  Oh, and 
I'm gonna eat beans and fart, and pollute the air supply. :)  That was 
the discussion.  Will the arrest me next for that?

Yeah, and I have the root password for the machines I've installed and 
run.  Whoop Whoop.

Like maybe he was building a resistor?  Wait, I forgot, resistance if 
futile, you will be assimilated.

And how would a carbon fiber do that?
 
Hey, I have a bottle of Tabasco(tm) sauce on my desk.  Someone might come 
out of the woodwork and claim that I was planning to put that in the 
water supply.  Hehehehe... :(
