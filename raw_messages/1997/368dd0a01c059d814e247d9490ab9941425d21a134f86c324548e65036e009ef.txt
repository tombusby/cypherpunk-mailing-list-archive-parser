*** CompuServe reports e-mail court victory

CompuServe, after winning a court decision making unauthorized junk
e-mail illegal, responded Thursday to a report that Cyber Promotions,
Inc., a commercial mass e-mailer, would not accept a federal court's
halting of its spamming activities directed against CompuServe
subscribers. Cyber Promotions indicated that it would appeal the
decision, which follows the settlement of a similar suit. That
settlement allows Cyber Promotions to send junk e-mail to another
Internet service provider's members. CompuServe said its goal "was to
see this through to a binding court decision." For the full text
