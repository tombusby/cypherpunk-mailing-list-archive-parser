To treat various Venerial Diseases whose standard treatments are
antibiotics.

What does seem to have credence is that the use of antibiotics breeds
resistant strains of bacteria, which may or may not be contagious.

A book that poses an opposing viewpoint to the current AIDS epidemic
is _The AIDS War_ by John Lauritsen (1993, Asklepios, New York, ISBN
0-943742-08-0).  It is written from a Gay man's perspective dissenting
from the current HIV-AIDS theory.  Another book he wrote is _Poison by
Prescription: The AZT Story_.  Also search on Peter H. Duesberg for
primary sources in various Journals.
