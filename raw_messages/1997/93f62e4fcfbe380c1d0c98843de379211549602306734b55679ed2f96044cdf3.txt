I don't expect anybody to "believe me".  That's why I have posted a URL to a 
post by Jeff Burchell in which he outlines your tactics, such as your demand
that he turn over his logs to you, which would have had the effect of 
compromising the remailer's security and eroding confidence in it.  Is that
really what you wanted?  For remailer users to distrust the remailer net and
stop using it?  You have still not explained why you wanted the remailer logs 
and what you intended to do with the names and addresses contained therein.

Would you care to prove that?  Saying something that Gary Burnore or Belinda
Bryan don't like is not "libel".  To be "libel" a statement must be both
DEFAMATORY as well as FALSE.  While being reminded of your own actions
several months ago might prove to be embarassing, it's not libel.

What was really laughable was when your fellow DataBasix staff member Billy
McClatchie accused another anonymous usenet poster of "slander"!  He must have 
gone to the same law school as Belinda. <g>

That's not what Jeff's post said.  It said that your pretext for demanding his
user logs was an "unflattering post", not all this nonsense about "spam baiting"
that you invented later.

My "harassment"?  You keep whining about my so-called "harassment", but you
have yet to prove ANY of it.

What would people have to be smoking (and inhaling) to believe that nonsense?
Anyone who demands that a remailer operator violate the privacy of all of his
users to placate one chronic whiner is no "friend" to remailers.  Such 
"friends" they can do without.  What do you think it would have done for the 
reputation of remailer security if Jeff had actually kept logs and had turned 
them over to individuals such as you and Belinda?

Do you really think it would be more "pro remailer" to just pretend that your
attempt to attempt to obtain sendmail logs from the Huge Cajones Remailer 
didn't occur?

Of the two of us, I'm the one that admits to actually USING remailers.  For me
to try to shut them down would make no sense.

If you don't like being called anti-privacy, stop being anti-privacy.
