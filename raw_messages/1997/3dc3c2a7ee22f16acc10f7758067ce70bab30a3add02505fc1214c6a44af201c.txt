Hey!  I always love it when someone references *MY* work :-) Just for
the record: Paul, David, and I did (and continue to do) the Onion
Routing work...Stuart, Paul, and David are working on other areas
together (granted, those areas may use a system like Onion Routing to
accomplish some of the anonymity necessary, but it is different work).
If anyone wants more info than the URL above gives, drop me a line...
