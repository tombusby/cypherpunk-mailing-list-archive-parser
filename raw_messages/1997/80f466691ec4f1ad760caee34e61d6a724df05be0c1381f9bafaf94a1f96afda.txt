V-Communications has a nice Bios Pre-Processor for their dissasembler for
anyone intrested it playing with their bios code. Most newer MB's come with
Flash Bios and the software to Flash the chip is available for download
from the Manufacture. I'v gone and tinkered around with the bios on a
couple of my AMI motherboards.

Flash bios does open the possibility for a virus infection of ones bios. I
have had several intresting discussions with the AMI programmers about
this. IMHO any device that has flash bios should have a jumper on the
circuit board to enable/disable the flash option. I have not seen anyone
that is doing this with their products.

The MB bios is relativly safe as the flash process happens pre-post but
considering that flash bios can be found in almost all computer prerifials
the potential for harm is there. Currently on my system I have flash bios
on the HD's, modem's, NIC's, & SCSI card's. All are a potential hiding spot
for a virus.
