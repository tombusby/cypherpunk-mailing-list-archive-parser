Well, so much for PICS being "voluntary." It seems the Euro-fascists are
already planning to incorporate it as a control mechanism.

(But, then, only fools thought PICS would be a "voluntary" self-ratings
system. It will by the Zyklon-B of the German-French-British information
Holocaust. And the United States will of course also try to implement this.
Only the recent "setbacks" in crypto laws--Bernstein, Denning's cold feet,
Clinton's troubles, Ruby Ridge prosecution, etc.--give me any comfort. )

The rest of what Ulf forwarded shows just how deeply the Europeans have
been infected. It needs to be monkeywrenched.

Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
