Having recently come out of retirement (my temporary early
retirement, longer than I would have dreamed I could have pulled off,
was wonderful), I have not hit upon a smooth stride in my email
reading techniques.  Riding the bus (most) every day means that I am
going to be running up to date on my Herald Tribune, Economist, Byte,
Science News, Scientific American, etc., but I am behind on such
things as the DCSB mailing list.

So I don't know whether this has gone by on the list, you might want
to send it out:

>Abstract
>
>The explosion of the Internet has brought with it a
>desire to allow information goods to be bought or sold
>over the network.  Several schemes for realizing this
>have been proposed over the last year, and there are a
>number of commercial ventures to support electronic
>commerce.
>
>In the first part of this talk, I examine several
>protocols for electronic commerce from the perspective
>of the distributed transactions.  Most models of
>electronic commerce have presumed a highly-available
>error-free network.  I argue for a more realistic model
>of commerce using notions of atomicity in electronic
>commerce, and propose three levels of atomic
>transactions.  I will discuss how to exploit network
>failures to explicitly attack commercially used
>protocols and fraudulently obtain goods or money.
>
>In the second part of the talk, I will discuss two very
>different approaches to achieving high degrees of
>atomicity:  the first, an internet billing system
>called NetBill is being used to allow highly atomic
>microtransactions of information goods.  This
>technology has recently been licensed for commercial
>use.  The second approach, Information Based Indicia,
>uses secure coprocessor hardware to ensure atomicity,
>and is being adopted by the US Postal Service to
>address their problem of theft of postage through
>counterfeit postage indicia.
