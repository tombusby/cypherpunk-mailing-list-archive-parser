You can't deny that the more guns there are available, the more people
will get shot. There may be some people that are capable of owning a
gun and using it wisely (ie. not), but I don't believe that this is a
significant fraction of any population.

Urgl? The situation only becomes more explosive if both sides are
armed. Look at the arms race, which is now, thank god, over. I am
amazed at the amount of restraint both sides displayed during that
time, although it's been really close a few times.

It's really simple: If there are no guns, no one will get shot.

I _am_ talking about disarming a population. I don't know which 'it'
I'm not part of, but I am definately not part of the 'it' that
promotes death by gunshot.

Even if they did, dead people are still a Bad Thing. We had no quarrel
with the soldiers the resistance killed. Neither did most of them had
any quarrel with us. Just like the US troopers in Vietnam or some
other place.

Ok, you have a point there. Only it's not TV and movies (I don't have
a TV), it's reading the Cypherpunks list too often :)

I am not the gun control lobby, I am a citizen in a mostly gun-free
society, and glad of it. People getting shot here, be it robbery,
suicide, police violence or self defence is a rare occurence.

Over her, drive-by shootings are something from fairy tales.
