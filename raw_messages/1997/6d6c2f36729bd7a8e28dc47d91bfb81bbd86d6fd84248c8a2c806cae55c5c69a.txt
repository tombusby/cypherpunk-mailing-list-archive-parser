How about our friend J.F. Avon?  He has the misfortune to share
citizenship with Ms. Brown.  Thus, while he may be minding his own
business, doing nobody any harm, and pursuing happiness, should he
decline to spend thousands of hours of his life working to pay money
into Ms. Brown's socialist schemes, armed men will come to his house,
put him in a cage, and leave him there for years.

That's not a very friendly way to treat a neighbor, is it?

In the United States, many thousands of people correctly recognize
this situation.  Many thousands of people are gun owners.  Many
thousands of people are not only gun owners, but combat veterans.  The
logical outcome would be great violence directed towards the
government.  Yet, this has not happened (recently ;-).

Why?  Certainly if the sums at stake were involved between
governments, there would be fodder for many wars.

The only conclusion that can be drawn is that civilians, even armed
civilians with combat experience, are so overwhelmingly peace loving
that they will bend very far backwards to avoid trouble, even if it
means thousands of hours of work.  Can the same be said of career
military or government people?
