If the corporate is serious about preventing encrypted messages
leaving their net that they can't read, the simple solution is to
disallow employees from using encryption -- have the enforcer encrypt
it.

Even if you were to use CMR, it is dumb, dumb, dumb, to allow the
snoop key to remain after the message has passed the enforcer -- it
should strip it off on the way out.

Attempting to compress the plaintext helps -- if it won't compress
(much) you get suspicious.

Pointy-Haired-Boss randomness always works -- compresses well and can
encode anything.

Even with enforcer and CMR it's possible to get past it,
super-encryption, garbage in CMRK second recipient field, and
Pointy-Haired-Boss randomness.

Simpler, safer, and more effective to just escrow the employees
company use key -- that ensures there is only one recipient on the
message passing over the internet.

So ultimately prevention largely falls back to controlling what
software people are running inside the building -- no laptops in or
out, no floppies in or out, no installing software, metal detector at
door, body scan, the works.


Detection of sending encrypted mails is easier -- just try to decrypt
everything and have all keys necessary escrowed.  Anything which can't
be read doesn't make it in; anything sent which can't be read results
in a sacked employee.


Companies which aren't after this level of paranoia, but just want to
be able to recover company business mails queued when employee is away
-- fine have separate personal use keys attached to the same
signature key.
