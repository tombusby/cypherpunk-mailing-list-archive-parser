Basic skills such as typing, data entry or word processing will allow you to earn between $10 and $15 an hour.  More advanced skills such as medical billing, database management and bookkeeping earn $20 to $30 per hour and are a common occurence.

Those with even greater technical skills, graphic design, desktop publishing, basic programming or web site design can earn between $30 and $45 per hour.
