Timmy seems to be VERY bothered by those anonymous posts and would
surely like them to stop - perfectly illustrating why the "cypher punks"
are enemies of free speech. Timmy can killfile anything he doesn't like,
but he wants to prevent everyone else from seeing whatever information
Timmy doesn't want to be disseminated.

You lose, Timmy.  The truth wants to be free.
