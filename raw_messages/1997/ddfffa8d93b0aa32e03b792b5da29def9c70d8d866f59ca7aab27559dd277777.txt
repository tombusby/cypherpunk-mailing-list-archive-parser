This is a good thing to remember.  However, what you seem to be
calling immoral is holding a belief with which you disagree.

Is it possible to hold an immoral belief?  I don't think so.  Once
you've drawn a conclusion about the nature of the world you can hardly
decide that it would be immoral to understand the truth.  Actions, on
the other hand, can be immoral.  Let's not confuse beliefs with
actions.

What you seem to be proposing is that Tim May (or whoever) should
refrain from expressing certain of their beliefs about the world
because they are immoral.  You have seldom addressed Tim's statements
directly.  Orwell had a word for this: "crimestop".
