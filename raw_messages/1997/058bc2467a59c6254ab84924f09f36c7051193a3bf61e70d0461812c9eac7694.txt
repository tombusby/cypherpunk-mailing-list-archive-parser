No this flys in the face of 200 yrs of American laws and centuries more of
English law. If your rights have not been infringed then you can't sue. If
the State of Alaska passes a law that christianity is baned unless you are
a citizen of Alaska, and thus your rights have been infringed, you have no
basis to file suit! Now you can fly up to Alaska stay for a few mins and
then file suit as now you have a claim of infringement.

This is no different than if John Doe goes and beats you neighbor with a
baseball bat. You can not file asault charges against him only your
neighbor can.

At the hart of the matter is the theory of decentrialized government and
wether the citizens of one state have the right to force the citizens of
another state to bend to their will. Myself personlly do not want the
people of NY, or TX, dictating to me how I should live in FL any more than
I want the Feds to do so. If you wish to come here and live here then you
should be given an equal voice on how we do things otherwise it's none of
your dam business. This swings both ways. I am sure that you would not
want the people of other states dictating what laws TX must or must not
pass.

Well all the above cases seem to be direct grivences against the Federal
Government not the individule States. Now you may have a case for grivence
against TX, you being a citizen of Texas, for complacency in these actions
of the Federal Government but they are really two seperate cases. You have
the greviance against the Fed's for violating the Constution and you have
the greviance against TX for not protecting your rights. Alaska on the
otherhand has no obligation nor right to protect you as you are neither a
citizen or resident of that State and it's powers are limited to it's
boundaries.

>- the abrogation of the states duties as equals to the federal govt.

Here is where you would have a gerviance against the states. Even so you
would be limited to filing a greviance against the state you were a
citizen and/or resident of.

>And as a matter of course most other issues resting on Constitutional

I was only presenting this as a hypothetical senario. I am unaware of
anyone bringing suit against all 50 states this entire discution is of a
hypothetical nature.

If we could only find a way to create a county of men rather than a county
