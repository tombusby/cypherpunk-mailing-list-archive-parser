Three newspapers have pieces today on the new WTO
telecom agreement. A Page 1 NYP report examines the
administration's favoring of the once-moribund WTO over 
the UN as a principal means for "exporting US free-market 
values through global commercial agreements."

The telecom agreement, for the first time, allows the WTO
to go inside the signatory countries and check compliance, and
if warranted, impose sanctions, a role once reserved to the UN.

While encryption is not mentioned, it's worth watching the
WTO globally unite its privacy-invasive predecessors: the 
national tele-tappers. The spin is that now all governments can 
have access to the global (wiretap) network under guise of
enhanced commercial competition. (And that's why Commerce was 
given EI for CCL.)
