Panix is extremely censorous. I know of at least 3 cases where they pulled
plugs on their users because they didn't like the contents of their speech.
(Many people here probably remember Fred Cherry - Panix pulled his plug for
"homophobia".)
chris.com pulled the plug on TRRJC3 (Igor's pal) because of content.
I also wouldn't trust Lance Cottrell.  He's selling privacy for the $$, not
for the ideology; he'll bend over the moment he thinks there's more $$ in
bending over, which is usually the case.
Remember how Sameer Parekh's C2Net used to try to peddle a "privacy ISP"
because he failed miserable and diversified into peddiling shitty software
and making idiotic legal threats? He happily pulled plugs bases on content,
while at the same time stating in court papers that he doesn't censor content.
What a pathological liar.
