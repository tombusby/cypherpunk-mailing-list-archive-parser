It is crown copyright; a report paid for with our (tax payer) money,
copyright the government.  I think theoretically that they could use
that to control republication.  (They were offering copies by calling
a number, but it is now "out of print" or whatever, also paper isn't
as useful as a web page anyway.)

Lots of mirrors ensures there is little point them trying to prevent
it.
