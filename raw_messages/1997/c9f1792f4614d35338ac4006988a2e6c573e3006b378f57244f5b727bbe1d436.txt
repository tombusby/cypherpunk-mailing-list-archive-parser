	That is astonishing.  Are you really really sure of your source ?
I presume this is for UNCLASS traffic and not anything in any way
sensitive ?   Of course PGP, when properly used, doesn't allow any
other agencies to monitor the coms, while Fortezza may - and this
may be a quite deliberate move by some in state to protect their cables
from being read by beaurocratic rivals...
