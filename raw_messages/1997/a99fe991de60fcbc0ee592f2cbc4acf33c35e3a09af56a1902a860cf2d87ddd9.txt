+Yes, if the Magna Carta guaranteed a right and the forefathers fought

    seems to me Jefferson said it took a rebellion every 20 years or so 
    to keep democracy awake...  other than presuming your answer is 
    tongue in cheek (not elsewhere), complacency == welfare.

+My contribution to this thread from the Cpunk History & Philosophy 
+Division:   a Jewish saying from a book I glanced through of couple of 
+weeks ago, something like:
+
+	"What good is it to a man who has lost his sight
+	  that his ancestors had perfect vision."

    not a lot, but that does not mean he should scorn those who have
    managed to retain their sight. your saying is rather characteristic 
    of the genre --best glamourized in Mad magazine.
