Maybe this will appear to you to be too-subtle a distinction, but I don't 
share the misimpression of equating what "society" (the citizenry?) accepts 
and what government-types accept.  For instance, as I understand it the 
public uniformly rejects the concept of wiretaps as a method of 
law-enforcement, yet they are done anyway.  In effect, it would be correct 
both to say:

a.   Society will never accept wiretapping.  (where "society" is defined as 
the collection of individuals)

   as well as saying...

b.   Wiretapping is a "recognized legal concept now."  (because the 
implication is that "recognized" refers to a tiny subset of society, the 
thugs who run the "justice system.")

Now, it's my own personal opinion that wiretapping is unconstitutional, but 
is done anyway for the same reason other unconstitutional things are 
regularly done by government:  Despite public disapproval, the public is 
never actually given the opportunity to make the decision.

The fact is, libel lawsuits are apparently a rather rare "tool" that we 
don't even need.  Perhaps a REAL LAWYER <tm> who is aware of the statistics 
can tell us how often they actually occur.  I argue that something that rare 
is, almost by definition, not really needed.

Yes, I'd like to "remove a few lawyers," as well.  Not quite the way you 
would, however.

Why not a full "loser pays" system?  And I mean NOT ONLY for civil cases, 
but also criminal cases!  Perhaps the government would be a bit less 
enthusiastic about harassing drug defendants if it was forced to pay for 
their acquittals after a FIJA loss!   

Consider, for example, that if the government had to pay after a loss, it 
would become very difficult for the government to harrass a person like Phil 
Zimmermann, unlike today where charges can be brought even if it is 
recognized they won't stick, secure in the knowledge that he'd be out a 
great deal of money in his defense.  How much sweeter would the victory be 
if all costs were compensated?

Do you always produce such opaque commentary?  <Sigh>   Perhaps you could 
re-write the above statement in ordinary English.

The reality is, the guarantees supposedly provided by the US Constitution 
are guarantees in name only.  The system is thoroughly corrupted and biased.

It's hard to know how you come to this conclusion.  If anything, what I'm 
trying to do is to permanently destroy a system which has allowed a tiny 
fraction of society to control things for the rest of us for centuries, and 
longer.  If anything, it is the system I'm trying to destroy which has taken 
the position that, in reality, people are not equal.

On the other hand, I'm NOT a proponent for "egalitarianism," or enforced 
equality, at all!  I'm confident that once the system is dismantled that 
enforces inequality on us, we can live with the result.

It's interesting that I keep seeing the same misinterpretations of the AP 
system.  AP is not simply about killing people.  And no, it hasn't been 
tried before.    The occasional assassination is no more like AP than a 
random shot in the dark is like a well-aimed round.  The first may, rarely, 
do the same thing as the second, but there is no prospect of a likely 
repetition.

_SOME_ people seem to "get" this, why not you?  The _absolutely_essential_ 
element that distinguishes AP is the system that allows people's individual 
desires to be denominated in terms of money, and accumulated until an 
anonymous person satisfies that desire and collects the reward.  And, 
moreover, that this system remains in place forever.

I keep telling you that "AP has never been tried before."

AP is NOT the same thing as mere assassination.  Period.  If anything, there 
are excellent reasons why ordinary assassination can, indeed, increase 
corruption while the AP system would reduce it.  

The most obvious difference is this:  The motivations are vastly different.  
Heretofore, assassinations have occurred based on the desires of only a tiny 
fraction of the population.  Often one person, or only a few.  In other 
words, the assassinations which DO occur are NOT the ones that "the rest of 
us" would choose.  The latter type DO NOT occur!

It isn't necessary that any system be "democratic."    "Democracy" assumes 
that certain questions need to be answered by VOTE, as opposed to simply 
allowing individuals to answer those questions for themselves.  We don't all 
get together and vote on what religion we'll all be forced to observe, do 
we?  No.  That's because it is accepted that certain areas are off-limits 
for even a "democratic" system to decide.  We don't have a national vote to 
decide what color to paint ALL of our houses.   We don't have a vote to 
decide what meal to eat next Thursday.  

Well, in my opinion there are few if any proper functions for a so-called 
"democratic" system.  That's because I believe that most if not all 
decisions currently made in any "democratic" system shouldn't be made at 
that level at all!

You clearly don't understand it!
