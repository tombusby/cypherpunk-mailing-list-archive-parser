I havent chosen nothing like that. 
I read all the stuff from all the messages from before modernation 
and since then and nobody got to choose nothing. You told them what
they were going to gwet and thats what they got.
Anybody that made it plain that they werent happy got thrown in the
trashcan and labled as being a flamer.

1311 addresses that you stole for your censored list.
Nobvody subscribved to cypherpunks-censored. You put them there cause
its you decided it was your list an dyou could put people where you
wanted even if they didnt like it.
My uncle calls it the cyperpunks-Auschwitz list. Thats what subdir
he keeps it in in his Dorks dir.

I could use it before and Im just a kid but Im not a lamer. 
Maybe you should call the list you stole cypherpunks-lamers.

I know you are or else you wouldna thrown cypherpunks honest and
truthful feelings in the flames-crapper.

I read a lot of flamessages which people put a lot of their thouhgts 
into bu t they were emotional cause people get like that when someone
doo-doos on them.

You dont make any signal/noise at all since you dont even send messages
to the list. (except when you want tell bs about how people "chose"
Sandy to be their dictator when they didnt)

Not necessary either if your a dictator.

Howcum reading the list is a wast eof your time but making decisions
for ecveryone on the cypherpunks isnt?

1311 ofg them?
Howcum you just stole all of the list people for your censored list?
I think that was real stupid unless you just didnt care if people 
would know that your were stealing the list for yourself. It was
really rotten to call pewople flamers just cause they complained.

Thats what those GAK guys are for and all those secret govbernment
guys that want there not to be a cypherpunks anymore.

No you already done too much.

I will. Im just a kid but I cant do any worse than already.

Im a kid so I get told to shut up all the time but I dont.

What do you mean _we_ white man? (thats a joke)
You havent talked about nothing on the list except how your not a
bad guy for pushing people areound into the lists where you want
them whether they like it or not.

You stole my uncles subsribing to the cypherpunks list and made him
a censored person. He had to break out to go to the uncensored list.
I think your a lamer.
