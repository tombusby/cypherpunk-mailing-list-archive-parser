The (very very very very very) minor redeeming factor is that you have to
be someone with knowledge of someone's valid Texas driver's license.  So
it's not *FULLY* available on the net.  Though, someone will probably leak
a userid in the next week or so, and then anyone can use it...

Why do people do these things?  (I wonder if publiclink is actually
physically located in Texas..)
