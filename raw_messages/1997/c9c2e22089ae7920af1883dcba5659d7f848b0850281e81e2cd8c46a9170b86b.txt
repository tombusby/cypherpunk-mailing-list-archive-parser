Thanks, I guess, to all of you who sent further information on this case.

I'm chagrinned at this repetitive pattern, though: all it takes is a "I
don't remember" for a thread to be completely dominated by helpful
comments, clarifications, etc.

(Ditto for any question even remotely impinging on financial or tax advice,
which is why I almost always include requests that helpful tax advice not
be sent to me. I can't seem to mention tax issues without a bunch of
helpful souls sending me their ideas on how to beat taxes by incorporating
myself in Andorra and then hiring myself as a consultant to the Andorran
embassy in California, or whatever.)

One strategy I've considered is to never, never, ever admit that I don't
know something, as this will forestall the corrections, expansions,
clarifications, and citings.

Or to express things more elliptically. It pays to be Young.
