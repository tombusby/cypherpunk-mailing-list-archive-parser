I posted Snuffle to the Coderpunks list:

Date: Tue, 26 Aug 1997 18:25:10 -0700
To: coderpunks@toad.com
From: Jonathan Wienke <JonWienk@ix.netcom.com>
Subject: Snuffle! (In celebration of the Bernstein decision)
Sender: owner-coderpunks@toad.com

[Snuffle source code deleted, check Coderpunk archives for details.]

I don't know how many foreigners subscribe to the list, but I have see
