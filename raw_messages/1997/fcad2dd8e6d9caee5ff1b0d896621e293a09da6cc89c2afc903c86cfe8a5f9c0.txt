Looking through a shitload of old messages, looks like someone decided to
write some mail in my own name.  Carefully looking at the headers shows
that this was sent through torfree.net or something, and didn't orginate
here.

Too bad I didn't spot this earlier...

Did you pay for your TV?  Do you buy electricity by the KWH?
Pay a monthly cable bill?  If so, then why isn't a television 
commercial considered theft of your televised resources?

Doesn't it cost something to ride the bus?  Then why aren't
the public transport's advertisers guilty of stealing your
wallspace?

What about newspapers, magazines, radio stations, going to
the movies, driving on any road, almost any PAID activity in
life?  Each has its attendent advertisments and commercials.

We PAY for an enormous percentage of solicitations.  Everyday.

>>>>>>>  WHY SHOULD YOUR EMAIL BOX BE ANY DIFFERENT?  <<<<<<<

Fact is, it isn't.  Nor will it ever be.  When you make any
contact in public via any media or communication form, there
will come invitations, solicitations, possibly vexations and
the like.  It's one of the prices we must pay in order to be
able to communicate at all.
