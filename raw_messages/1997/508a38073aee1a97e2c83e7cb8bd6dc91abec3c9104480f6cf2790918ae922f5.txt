The current round of bills on crypto are going to be far worse for the net 
than the congresscritters can possibly understand.

Here are the questions I have not seen answered...

What will this do to the MIT distribution of PGP?  I expect that it will make 
it illegal.

How does this affect the security software distribution sites at University 
and US government sites? I expect that it will shut them all down.

If the Kerry bill passes (and I expect it will) it will make many of the US 
sources of free security software unavailable and/or illegal.

And this is to make the net more secure?

For who?
