Actually, much of the meticulous C and Unix detail described the permitted
loopholes. For example, there is no definition of <newline>, which is 0x0D
<carriage return> on Mac, 0x0A <line feed> on Unix, both on DOS, and neither
on VMS (it's a record boundary in the simplest case, and don't ask about the
complex cases). Look, if VMS is "Posix-complient," which it is, it can't be
a really robust specification, no matter how meticulous.

Java goes into great detail to define floating-point representation,
to take one example, and the "end of line" sequence is a system parameter,
rather than a static character.

Yes, but it won't solve many interesting problems. Java is a good
balance between portability and capability.

Check out the 100% pure program that you can download from JavaSoft.
Look at <http://www.javasoft.com/100percent/> Their static verification
package is free, along with a programming guide. (You have to pay for
dynamic testing and certification.)

Been there, done that (look for the Decus-CPP Preprocessor I did in the
mid 1980's, or my Lempel-Ziv implementation for VMS). Preventing problems
by design is a better approach.

Again, the 100% pure test package is freely available. Sun does, however,
charge for stress testing, which runs the application on a number
of Java implementations.

Sun is hiring. Check out their web pages.
