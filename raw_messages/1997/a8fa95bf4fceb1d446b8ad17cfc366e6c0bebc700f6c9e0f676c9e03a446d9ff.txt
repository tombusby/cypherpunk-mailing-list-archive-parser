due to the LOW INVESTMENT
and HIGH PROFIT POTENTIAL.

WHAT TO DO
On a blank sheet of paper, write "Please put me on your mailing list"
along with your name and address and put it with a Five-Dollar Bill.  
Through regular mail, send this to the last person on the list below.  
ONLY THE LAST PERSON ON THE LIST GETS YOUR NAME AND $5 
BILL!
Then remove that name from the list.  Move the other three names 
down and add your name to the list in the #1 position.

After you have re-typed the list with your name in the #1 position,
MAKE AT LEAST 20 COPIES OF THE LETTER AND SEND IT OUT
IMMEDIATELY TO 20 OR MORE PROSPECTS.
Friends, relatives - anyone you'd like to see get rich along with you!
The faster you act, the faster you'll get your money!

US Mail or Email!!!
For email, you can just copy this whole letter and paste it into 
the body part of AOL's "Compose Mail" box.  
Then be sure to remove the last name on the list below,
and add your name as the first.
YOU STILL HAVE TO USE REGULAR MAIL TO SEND YOUR $5
AND ADDRESS TO THE LAST NAME!
That's what keeps this legal and how everyone gets paid!

That's all there is to it!  Here's how it works:

1.  You send out 20 letters to 20 Prospects
2.  Those 20 mail out 20 letters each (400)
3.  Those 400 mail out 20 letters each (8,000)
4.  Those 8,000 mail out 20 letter each (160,000)
5.  And those 160,000 people mail YOU 5$ each ($800,000)
Your entire investment is only $5!!!  Very inexpensive when you consider
the results you can get!
