And really, once we drop all the propaganda memes, isn't it sort of
reasonable that if people are able to talk to each other without fear
of retribution that the right things are going to happen?

Oh, but The Masters of War understand all too well what this
technology is about!

"The story is told of Sir John Hawkwood (1.) that when two mendicant
friars greeted him with the conventional 'God give you peace', he
retorted: 'God take from you your alms.'  When pressed for an
explanation, he replied: 'Why do pray to God that I should die of
hunger?  Do you not know that I live by war and that peace would undo
me?'"

1. Hawkwood was a highly successful English leader of mercenaries in
Northern Italy during the 14th century.
