    the assholes missed the point...

>U.S.  government takes hard line on Mitnick.  
>US Hacker Pleads for Help
>
>A US 'hacker'- Kevin David Mitnick - has issued a plea
>for financial help to fight his defence case through

>
>USA.  Through Randolph, Mitnick is claiming that the

    anybody who thinks that does not happen in Federal
    prisons has their eyes closed.  the only light is
    through the observation port, and a 4 in. hole in
    the floor is provided for defecation, etc. the one
    hour per day is for exercise and the every other 
    day shower. cell space requirement: 49 sq. ft.

    the feds will not permit the states this torture,
    but that does not stop the BOP...

>Perhaps the most puzzling aspect to the whole case is
>the fact that while the US government has never sought
>to prove that Mitnick profited from his 'hacking'
>activities - although he could certainly have done so
>by 'selling' stolen airtime to third parties.  Instead
>they claim he caused losses in excess of $80 million.
>
    easier to charge losses for what he used and/or
    blocked

>Kevin certainly appears to be paying the price for his
>nefarious deeds having already spent nearly two years
>in custody during which time he has been prohibited
>from any access to wireless communications equipment,
>computer hardware or computer software.
>
    well, what do you expect? something of value?

>It's difficult to know exactly which side is the more

>part of a deliberate US government plot to divert
>scrutiny away from its plans concerning the control

>Internet.
>
    must be a cypherpunk candidate; we know they're
    trying to take over.  

>The case would seem to present a most powerful

    sure...
