I've looked at this, there are two problems:

1. The message is in [A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*()] ASCII.  The translation scheme
is undisclosed.
2. The message is, apparently, compressed to some proprietary standard.

So, someone's going to have to hack disassembly to get this message into binary.
Once that's done, we can start bruting it.
