Guys,

Here's a patch for PGP 2.6.2 (and 2.6.3i) source which locks all
process pages in memory (will not swap to disk) under Linux if
the user is running with effective root privilege.  You might
consider putting something like this in PGP 5.0.  Also, this
patch should be generalizable to POSIX systems withthe mlockall(2)
function.  If you have any success in generalizing it to POSIX,
please let me know, as I only have access to Linux.

See 'man memlockall' for more info.

Version:	25JUL97
Entered-date:	25JUL97
Description:	Patch for Linux PGP 2.6.2 and PGP 2.6.3i source to lock all
		pages in physical memory if running with root privilege.

		This keeps sensitive data from being swapped to disk, where
		it could be later recovered by undesirables.

		There is no effect if not run with effective root privilege.
		Root privs are immediately dismissed, allowing pgp to be
		safely installed SUID root (assuming its chmod'ed 4111).
		pgp.c is modified, increasing executable size by ~391 bytes.
