Hi all-

	An important message from the administrator of one of the best run
remailers (IMHO), nym.alias.net, follows. This is especially important to
those using nym.alias.net in their reply blocks or as their sole nym
remailer.

	Fred

	Although in theory, there's no difference between 
	theory and practice, in practice, there is.

The alias.net domain has been put "on hold" by the internic.  The
result of this, among other things, is that host nym.alias.net no
longer exists.

Since the alias.net domain itself it not administered by the same
people as nym.alias.net, I don't yet know why this is.  Given that
today is exactly 3 months after the creation anniversary of alias.net,
and the fact that the internic does an extremely poor job of billing
people and processing their payments, I suspect this has resulted from
some sort of billing confusion rather than any kind of anti-remailer
activity.  However, I've not heard back from the alias.net
administrators yet, so don't know anything for sure.

I just wanted to get the word out that we have no intention of
shutting down nym.alias.net.  The machine is still up and running, and
will be useable as soon as domain name service is restored.
