Is Bill Clinton Obstructing Justice in
              the Case of
            Charles Hayes?

          by J. Orlin Grabbe

1.   Did  President Bill  Clinton  meet
with  Kentucky District Judge  Jennifer
B.  Coffman at the Watergate  Hotel  on
May  21,  1997?   Has Coffman  suddenly
become    an   important   Presidential
advisor?  Was the meeting just  another
tête-à-tête similar to the one  Clinton
had  with Paula Jones?  Is Bill Clinton
obstructing justice?

2.   Is  Judge Coffman in the  meantime
sitting on, and attempting to ignore, a
slew  of  motions from Hayes'  attorney
Marvin   Miller?   Is   Judge   Coffman
herself guilty of judicial misconduct?

3.   Why  did  Assistant U.S.  Attorney
Patrick   Malloy  recently   asked   to
withdraw  from the Chuck  Hayes'  case?
Why  did Judge Coffman refuse to  allow
him to withdraw?

4.   Where has the alleged hit man  Don
Yarbrough  disappeared  to?   Does  his
disappearance have anything to do  with
falsified information given to the FBI?
Did  the  FBI previously say  they  had
verified this information?

5.   What  perjury  charges  have  been
filed   against   FBI   agent   Stephen
Brannan?

6.   What  perjury  charges  have  been
filed  against FBI agent David  Keller?
Was or was not David Keller transferred
to the Atlanta office of the FBI?

7.   Has  Lawrence Myers been impeached
as  a  witness because he was diagnosed
as having multiple personalities by the
U.S. Army?

8.   Are  there any remaining witnesses
against Charles Hayes?

9.   What  is the relationship  between
Judge   Jennifer  Coffman  and  Wendell
Ford?

10.    Was   Jennifer   Coffman   under
investigation       for       financial
improprieties  at  the  time  she   was
appointed judge?
