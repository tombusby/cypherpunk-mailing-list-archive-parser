That's questionable at best. Also, there can be so much ingenuity in
making the ads appear unreadable, that it would be hard to watch who
is good and who is bad.

For example, how about this signature that purports to advertise
http://www.kaka-kola.com:

^L^L^L
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
= please ignore contents of this sig -- skdjhgf asdgf -- == <blink>
<color=#000000> = http://www.devnull.com http://acd http://www.www.www
http://www.kaka-kola.com http://xxx == </color></blink> == this sig
intentionally made unreadable to cheat alice ==

Well, one can modify newsreaders to delete only lines that match
the regexps, but show other parts of the article. That may be one
of the pieces of functionailty of libkillfile.so that I once mentioned.

Agree.

Another thing Alice can do is to make Bob post an encrypted ID, such
that each time it is encrypted with a separate "session" key. The
keys do not have to be that long.

Instead of ID Bob can encrypt the address to send the money to, and
possibly his public key. That generally adds robustness to the system,
since there would be no known person to complain about.

Bob can also ask Alice to generate a lot of IDs for him -- like 1000 or
so -- to use them later. Alice would have to keep a database of 
ID <---> email address correspondence.

Alice can set up an autoresponder bot getid@alice.com that would generate
IDs and send them back to requestors.

If it bounces, Alice would usually get the money back in the bounce message.

Can't alice put a stop on a piece of digital cash? I am not sure, but it
may be possible. It is surely possible with adding one more trusted party,
and some more signing and encryption, anyway.

Alice can then cheat and issue the cancels herself. Since most spammers
are crooks, I expect that to happen a lot. No good.

I can generate a gazillion posters from algebra.com.

Of course, Alice can also introduce per-domain restrictions.
