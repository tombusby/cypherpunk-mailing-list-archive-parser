Same here. The PGP plug in was awful... (if it didn't find the key... 
and the key had to have the exact user-id you were mailing to) it 
sent it out in the clear. A serious bug.

Might be worth making suggestions to the Pegasus Mail team... now 
that PGPMail is out, they could 'modify' the plug-ins for Version 3.0 
(which I hear they are working on).  Since it's made in New Zealand, 
there's no ITAR/EAR problems.

As for remailers, once crypto is plugged in, a remailer plug-in with 
would work. (That's possibly an easy-enough hack too.)

An API for PGPMail you'd be a nice thing... then one can write apps 
to use it.
