PGP will encrypt any file.  The win95 version allows you to do it with one 
click of a mouse button from explorer, as PGP becomes fully integrated into 
Win95.

Some notes about PGP5.0 for Win95...  later versions of the Eudora/PGP 
product do not support RSA, only DSS keys.  To fix this and get it back to 
the functionality of the beta versions, you can purchase a PGP RSA module for 
$5 directly off of the PGP web site.

I'm testing the PGP5.0/RSA against various Linux versions and getting mixed 
reviews on how well it works.  But some of these problems seem to be operator 
error, and overall pgp5.0 is working well.
