   Today/Gallup poll, Americans now favor, by a thin margin, a flat tax
   system in which all Americans would pay the same percentage of their
   income in taxes -- regardless of how much money they make.
   [INLINE] But the public opposes two central features of flat tax
   proposals: the elimination of deductions for mortgage interest and for
   charitable contributions.
   [INLINE] Only one third of the country would favor replacing the
   current income tax system with a national sales tax which would apply
   to all retail purchases. The public believes that most Americans pay
   their fair share in taxes.
   [INLINE] The poll interviewed 1,019 adult Americans on November 21-23.
   [INLINE] The results are as follows:
   [INLINE] Flat Tax System
   [INLINE] Favor, 51 percent
   [INLINE] Oppose, 46 percent
   [INLINE] Flat Tax System With No Mortgage Deduction
   [INLINE] Favor, 42 percent
   [INLINE] Oppose, 54 percent
   [INLINE] Flat Tax System With No Charitable Deduction
   [INLINE] Favor, 43 percent
   [INLINE] Oppose, 53 percent
   [INLINE] Replacing Income Tax With National Sales Tax
   [INLINE] Favor, 32 percent
   [INLINE] Oppose, 62 percent
   [INLINE] Do Most Americans Pay Their Fair Share in Taxes?
   [INLINE] Yes, 54 percent
   [INLINE] No, 43 percent
   [INLINE] Sampling error on all of the above questions: +/-3 percentage
   points. Link to top
