The problem is that one of the partners is often too stupid to use PGP.

That is very annoying. Not that any of the contents of my hard disk
are that sensitive, but under linux I run my wipedisk program two times
every night. just another cron job.

But think about this: suppose there is a couple, bob@household.com,
and alice@household.com. Suppose that Rev. Mallory does not like bob.
Mallory forges a lot of emails like "I can still taste your sperm
on my lips", that appear to originate from Cindy@phonesex.org.

Then, promptly, Mallory sends an anonymous alert to alice@household.com, 
warning her about naughty email activities of bob. Alice gets mad at him
and divorces him.

How would bob protect himself against such developments?
