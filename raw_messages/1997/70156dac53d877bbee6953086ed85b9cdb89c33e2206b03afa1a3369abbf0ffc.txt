Cf. "FileGate", the frequent prosecution of IRS employees busted selling
American's personal tax information to PIs and other nosy parties, and FL
state(?) health worker caught giving out diskettes of AIDS patient records
at a local bar.  There are also cases of  DMV giving out contact info that
has resulted in stalkings and murders.  Look also for other Ames-alikes.
JEdgar himself was blackmailing.
