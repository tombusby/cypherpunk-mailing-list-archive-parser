Well, in some places, it's an expression of excitement, and it was intended
as such here.  I guess some things don't translate well to ASCII,
given that you seem to think I was picking on you?

The Georgia law was a bad one, and needed overturning.
I hadn't realized you were running EFGA on that small a scale, 
so I'm even more impressed that you succeeded.  
Similarly, the New York court's decision on the NY version of the CDA
was quite welcome, and the distributed internet project to crack
the DES Challenge key succeeded on the day that the Senate committee
was trying to tell us that 56kbps should be plenty for anybody.
It's been a _Good_Week_!

It got forwarded to remailer-operators, and was an obvious enough match
with Cypherpunks interests that I copied my reply there as well.
We're interested in privacy and anonymity, and in using cryptography
to build tools that will protect and advance these things.

Good court precedents are important as well; there are other people
in the movement doing lawsuits on the crypto export issues and
on free speech.

OK, so it was a lame attempt at humor, but a decision in favor
of anonymity is a Good Thing, and it seemed to be in character
for getting together to celebrate.

It's not the three dollars in parking that's keeping me from joining you
in celebrating; it's the $600 airfare I'd need to get to Atlanta...
