Aki Namioka is President of the Computer Professionals for Social

for civil rights with respect to electronic information.  Netizens may
remember Namioka's speech against the CDA at Seattle's "Internet Day of

We'll ask Ms. Namioka about the history of the CPSR, and current issues
CPSR follows in cyber rights, civil liberties, and technology education. 
 
She will be interviewed remotely over CU-SeeMe from the Speakeasy Cafe in
Seattle, Washington (http://www.speakeasy.org/).
