Put your own personal, business, or corporate attorney on retainer for only $70.  

Why pay $200.00 to $500.00 per hour for legal work?  Our staff of experienced 
attorneys are at your service.  Among the services provided are:

*  Legal writing and lawyer letters
*  Drafting and reviewing contracts and briefs
*  Research, advice, and opinions
*  Tax law
*  Real Estate
*  Negotiations and arbitrations
*  Accidents
*  Leases
*  Wills and trusts

You never have to leave the comfort of your home or office.  All work 
is done by phone, fax, or email.  You pay a monthly fee of only $70.  
The first hour each month is FREE and you pay only expenses plus 
$50 for each additional hour regardless of the type of work.

UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE - If you are not satisfied you will not 
be charged.  It's as simple as that.  

Note:  To protect your privacy, our name, address, and phone, fax and 
private email numbers will only be divulged to our clients. 

Don't get stuck paying one third of a cash settlement or a huge fee to an 
attorney for a few hours work.  Don't sign a contract, buy a house, settle a 
dispute, or make a major decision until you review it with your own personal 
attorney.  Don't let the company that's jerking you around get away without 
a lawyer letter.  Become our client now and have legal representation available 
at your finger tips.

To become our client, simply pay the $70 retainer fee for the first month.  Upon 
receipt of your retainer, we will send our contract of representation immediately.
