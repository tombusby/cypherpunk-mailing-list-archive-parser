Not necessarily, Steve - some people plonk others by filtering their mail 
to a folder called "trash" or "crap-messages" or whatever, so they don't 
have to read them at the same time they read the rest of their messages.  
Then they go through the trash folder later on just to see if they threw out 
anything that they shouldn't have, see the messages by the people they 
killfiled, and reply to some of them.  They HAVE plonked the person, but 
they can still read and reply to the plonked messages if they choose.  

IMO, this is a better way to killfile than redirecting everything to 
/dev/null, because if someone has a history of violently flaming whatever 
you say (like some people on this list who shall remain nameless), you don't 
have to read their flames at the same time with the rest of the mail, but 
still have the option of reading and replying to them later on if you so 
choose.

If you need to know how to set up a mail filter or defend against 
emailbombs, send me a message with the words "get helpfile" (without the 
" marks) in the SUBJECT: header, *NOT THE BODY OF THE MESSAGE!*  I have 
several useful FAQs and documents available.
