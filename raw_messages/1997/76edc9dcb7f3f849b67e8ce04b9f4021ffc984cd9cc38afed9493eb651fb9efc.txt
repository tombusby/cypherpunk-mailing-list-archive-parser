Ugly's the word for it, alright. ;-)

>What level of granularity does one use for the sub signature?

It would be nifty if there was a way to show that any continuous set
of bits were signed given only one signature on a whole document.
Intuitively, it seems to me that this might be provably inconsistent
with a secure hash.  Still, crypto results are full of surprises, so I
could imagine there is a way to do this.

Good point.  It is nice that people who quote out of context now in a
misleading way are convicted when you demand proof.

Still, my sense is that this would be a pretty useful thing to be able
to do and it would be technically interesting.

For example, you might want to reveal parts of a message signed by
somebody else without revealing the entire message.
