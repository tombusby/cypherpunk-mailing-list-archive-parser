I am not sure if you posted this information in response to my request
to cite a statute that would prove that libel is a crime.

These postings do not prove that libel is a crime. It is because libel
is not a crime. Libel is a tort, and unlike with crime, the government
cannot initiate a legal action against someone for libel. Only injured
(libeled) individuals and not the government can sue in a libel case.

I would appreciate if someone more knowledgeable about the law could
comment on this. I may be mistaken.
