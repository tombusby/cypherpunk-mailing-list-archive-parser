Well for backup purposes one would probably want to do their encryption on
a block size < file size. As an example for a 1M file you could encrypt it
as 10 seperate 100k blocks (or any suitable block size) rather than
encrypting the entire file in one block. I have programs on my system that
will do this for me but it would be best if all of this was built into the
backup software.

Myself I don't use tape. I use mirrored HD's and MO's & CD for short &
long term archives.
