we're going there too, and one of the things we wondered was whether it
might have been possible to hire a tent *locally*. I can get tents all
right, but the biggest problem is transportation. I surely hope that in
case you're going to rent one of their tents, delivery and pick-up is
included. Have you seen a transport-ready armytent already ? ;-) Amsterdam
is only 30' from Almere, by car. You do have a pick-up car don't you ? The
tent won't fit into my regular subaru ;-)

Our biggest cost is for transporting the tent from Belgium to Holland.
Interested in a compartiment ?
