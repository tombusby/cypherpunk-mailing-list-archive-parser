For another good read, try "The Truth Machine", by James L. Halperin.  It's
about a guy who invents Big Brother (a machine that can with 100% accuracy,
detect whether you are lying).  It's kind of scary, because Big Brother (in
the book) brings an end to war, world government, and general Utopia.

infringed" is too hard to understand? (From 2nd Amendment, U.S. Constitution)
