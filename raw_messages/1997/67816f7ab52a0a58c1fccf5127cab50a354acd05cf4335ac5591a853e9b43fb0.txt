But that isn't analogous to making an anonymous post to a public forum
such as a Usenet NG or a mailing list.

The best telephone analogy to that I can think of would be to place a phone
call from a payphone to one of those call-in radio programs, say what you
have to say, then hang up and listen to the responses over your radio.

Signing up for a telephone under a pseudonym implies that you desire
incoming calls (private replies) and is more analogous to a 'nym server.
