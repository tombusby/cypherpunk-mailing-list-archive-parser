Agree, that should be added:

15a. Dimitri received a legal notice from C2Net's lawyers about
Dimitri's allegations

Let's see I wrote:

Tim explained the situation in fair detail in his recent post,
explaining, after Sandy's "Absolutely false." retort to my above
claim.  Perhaps my wording could be more accurately changed in the
light of the further explanation from Tim to:

21. Tim was told by a C2Net employee that if he did not desist from
discussing Dimitri's claims about C2Net's StrongHold product, C2Net
would take legal action against him!
