> For a truly free communications medium we must have strong cryptography.

Seems to me that this is false. To have a truly free communcations medium we
must have no censors. The very fact that crypto is involved guarantees that
it isn't free. The use of crypto itself is a form of censorship if you don't
have the key.

> This is a given.

No, it isn't.

> Anonymity cannot be insured without strong cryptography

Tell that to publius. 200+ years later and we still fight over who wrote
what and they didn't even use a simple substitution cypher. The secret to
anonymity is the same as keeping a secret, those who know keep their mouths
shut.

How is crypto going to keep them from kicking the turning the phones off,
turning the power off, and kicking the front door in? It isn't.

Speech can't be truly free as long as any party can censor the traffic.

Then be so kind as to explain people who are intentionaly trying to force
legal cases in order to challenge standards? This is a clear 1-to-1 mapping
to flogging (per your example).

Unfortunately cyberspace can't exist without meatspace.

Only if you don't have a clue as to the technical, social and economic milieu
that it exists within. Show me a way to run a remailer program without a
computer which exists in meatspace and your proposition might work.

> The amount of "space" in

You have a small imagination. The amount of space in cyberspace in no more
than the sum total of all the hard drives in use on the network or network
accessible at any given time. It's measured in terabytes but that is hardly
unbelievable.

Your standards are pretty low when one considers that the largest databases
on the planet are measured in terabytes (1,000 gig's).

Really? Then please be so kind as to pay my monthy bills related to Internet
access. I assure you they are far from 'cheap'.

> A truly free communications medium must allow its users to be anonymous. 

No, it must provide no moderation on traffic. All anonymous access buys one
is reasonable deniability, a far cry from free communcations; and in fact
fundamentaly unrelated to the concept of free speech.

> That an opinion is unpopular does not make that opinion wrong or invalid.

Doesn't make it correct either, the proof is in the pudding.

In fact the validity of a thesis should in no way ever rest on the
personality or reputation capital, it should rest solely on what can be
proven and tested about it.

> Tim May is correct: Libertaria will thrive in cyberspace. 

Only in your collective wet dreams. Libertaria as described by Tim,
yourself, and others will never come to pass in that form.
