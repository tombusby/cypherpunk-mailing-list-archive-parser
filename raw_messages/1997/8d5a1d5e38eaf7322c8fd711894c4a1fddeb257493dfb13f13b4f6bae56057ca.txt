The time per year it takes for me to delete all these messages is about the
same as the amount of time it took me to reply to your previous message
plus the amount of time it will now take me to compose this reply.  All
back of the envelope, of course.

I've been on this list for 18 months and have seen plenty of worthwhile
posts from remailers.  You're entitled to your opinion, but I strongly
disagree.

So you're calling John Jay, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton cowards
(anonymous authors of the Federalist Papers)?  Many others have also used
anonymity to further the cause of liberty.  I doubt your real name is
"The Spectre" yet that is the name under which you are posting.  Are you
calling yourself a coward?
