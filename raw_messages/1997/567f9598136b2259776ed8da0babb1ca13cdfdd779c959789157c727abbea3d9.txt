Malarky, the country was founded on the belief in a God not a Christian god,
considering that Washington and Jefferson were not even Christians pretty
much blows that whole Christian promulgated lie.

Washington and Jefferson were deist.

At no point does the Constitution ever mention Christ.

Typical Christian attitude, preach but don't worry about practicing it.

And just in case you haven't got the clue yet, I will spell it out. There
are MANY groups who believe in a God. Very few of them believe Christ was
the son of God and our saviour.

I am a Pantheist, I believe in god but I can guarantee it bears absolutely
no resemblance to the Christian god. This realization was the whole point of
seperation of church and state and my god given right to practice my beliefs
even if they aren't rights given by YOUR god.

You need to retake Spin_Doctor_101 if you are going to try to pull that
sort of wool over peoples eyes ...
