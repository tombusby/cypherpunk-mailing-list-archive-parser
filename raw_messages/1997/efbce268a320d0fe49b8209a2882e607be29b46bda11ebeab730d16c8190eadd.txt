  John Young, New World Order Schill (secret member of the New
World Order of Schills), has cleverly and deceptively given us
a pointer to the 'official release' version of the GIP report
on electronic commerce, in which point #4 purports to be:
> 4. Governments and industry must respond to legitimate user
> concerns.

  In the triple-secret *real* GIP report, as JYA knows, point #4
is as follows:
"4. No one shall buy or sell unless they have the digital implant
of the New World Order in their right hand, or in their foreheads."
