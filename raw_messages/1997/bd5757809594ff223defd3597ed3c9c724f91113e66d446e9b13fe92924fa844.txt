  Thus protecting the citizens from the horrible spectre of reasonably
priced health care. Sick people around the nation must be applauding 
this government effort.

  I don't suppose that simply "dropping" the subsidy would have the
same result of reducing the number of doctors, would it?

  At the same time that the baby boom is turning into a geriatric boom
which will increase the need for physicians.
  Sounds like the makings a future "HEALTH CARE CRISIS!!!!" which the
government will have to address with new laws and a dramatic increase
in government funding for subsidized residency training.

  Thank God that the government has had the foresight to increasingly
arm a variety of government agencies so that they can step in to halt
the old, sick sheeple from rushing the medical centers.

  Oh, you mean like is regularly done in the "real" world? Is it "legal"
to do that without government assistance?

  Oh Horror, Oh Horror!
  Reasonably priced health care, and physicians forced to endure the
indignity of providing medical services to people in areas free of
big-city smog.
  Better to heavily arm the big-city government agents to thwart the
threat of all of those country bumpkins getting past the road-block
identity checks and attempting to access the dwindling number of
big-city physicians.

  Jim, did you make this post up? Are you a forger/spoofer? This post
is so typical of government insanity that it seems like a National
Lampoon parody.
