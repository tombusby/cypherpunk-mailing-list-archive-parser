            ARE YOU A BUSINESS OWNER WITH A WEB SITE?

    We got your E-mail address from your Business newsgroup posting.
        We did not put your E-mail address on a mailing list!

IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS OWNER WITH A WEB SITE, you should know that The Adult
Chamber of Commerce represents professional ADULT businesses on the Web.
The amount of traffic to our Web site is astounding.  A massive portion of
the Web has Doctors, Lawyers, Accountants, your neighbors, and all sorts of
people (buyers) visiting dult sites.  It's just the nature of the Web.

YOU CAN CAPTURE SOME OF THIS MASSIVE TRAFFIC TO YOUR WEB SITE through a
Membership in The Adult Chamber of Commerce.  All member companies, Adult &
Non-Adult, get listed in the Chamber member links section with an icon that
indicates you do business in accordance with the Better Business Practices
of The Adult Chamber of Commerce.  This listing literally guarantees
significant additional traffic to your Web site.

Membership in The Adult Chamber of Commerce is omething you should
consider if you are interested in getting greater exposure on the Web.
Member companies proudly display the Adult Chamber Logo on their web sites.

Each company is checked out before membership is approved.  Since it costs
a business as little as $240 annually for membership, it's not expensive
for a company to tell others that they support the only professional
organization for responsible ADULT businesses.  A business applies for
membership at the Adult Chamber Web site and visitors reularly check to
see if the company [they're planning to buy from] is a Member in Good
Standing.

      The Adult Chamber of Commerce web site is the place to find
           the BEST & most responsible companies on the Web.
