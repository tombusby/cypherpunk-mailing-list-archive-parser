With the recent announcement of Anthrax innoculations to be given to all US
military personnel because of potential bio-war applications many questions
have come up about what this means both militarily as well as for civilian
targets.

Such outbreaks as the above give real-world examples of the virulence of the
pathogen, efficiency of medical & political responces, as well as a base
lines to compare to models for disease spread.

In short, such instances as above represent the 'best effort' responce that
could be expected.
