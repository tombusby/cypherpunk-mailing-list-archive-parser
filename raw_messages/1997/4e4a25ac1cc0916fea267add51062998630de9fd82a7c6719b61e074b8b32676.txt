Good.  We agree, and can therefore move on.

History.  Backward compatibility.  Time pressures.  And a design for
short term communication keys for email does not yet exist -- not from
you, not from anyone.  [Your CDR proposal uses *long term*
communication keys.]

These seem pretty compelling reasons to me. 

Just because something is desirable doesn't mean it is practical, or 
even possible.

I did not because you presented it as a throwaway, with statements to
the effect that you already knew it was defective but you were
presenting it anyway.  Besides, in all honesty I did not find your
counterarguments very compelling, and I was content to wait until I 
saw a "real" proposal.  If I have a chance, though, I will go back 
and address that...

BTW, perhaps you remember a fairly long thread sometime back where I 
discussed the pros and cons of a "keysafe" model for data recovery 
keys?

I include both of those under my number 1.

                        ^^^^^^^^^frequently?

?I don't see the connection.  My point was that you can generate a key
pair, throw away the private key, and use the public key as the CMR
key.  Perhaps you could just use random bits in the correct format for
the public key, and never generate a key pair at all.  This would meet
external requirement of having a CMR key, but it would be meaningless,
since the missing private key could never be used to decrypt anything. 
Thus, though externally an organization (say an ISP) would be
complying with a regulation, in fact it would be impossible to 
recover any email anyway...

In any case, I presume the "danger" you refer to is the danger that 
someone will snarf the CMR key.  Changing it frequently will reduce 
the number of compromised messages if any given key is compromised.  
(Of course, the CMR keys will have to be preserved forever in a 
little database of some sort -- if you change them often, that 
database will be large...)

It is the MUA that uses PGP (Eudora, Mutt, whatever) that decides how
to store the decrypted files, not PGP.  PGP decrypts the files and
gives them to the MUA, which displays them to the user.  The MUA has
the option of storing it encrypted or not, as delivered, or with 
another key.  PGP isn't in control, it's the MUA, isn't it?

Whatever.  It does strike me that you seem to have difficulty in
maintaining composure whenever the term comes up, your prose gets
hasty, with missing words and odd syntax, and I suspect that your
usually razor-sharp edge suffers as well....  :-)
