It's rather self-serving to call this major lack-of-feature a
MAJOR SECURITY BUG.  Sure, it limits what you can do, but if it does
what it claims to do, it's not a bug, it's just lack of vision,
and there are _far_ more targets at Microsoft for complaints about that :-)
MAJOR SECURITY BUGs are things like ActiveX and JavaScript-you-can't-turn-
off.  At least they seem to take a fail-secure approach to unknown CAs
(even if it is fail-hostilely) rather than a more typical Microsoft
fail-insecure-but-friendly fallback.

The interesting capability that setting your own CAs isn't just that
it lets you choose which service providers can be roots of a hierarchical 
tree-of-CAs model - it's that it lets you go beyond that model
to support a web-of-trust model like PGP's, which is a Good Thing.
You can duplicate this in a hierarchical world (if you must :-)
by being the your own CA tree root, and certifying the other CAs you like.

Netscape's original SSL implementations also only supported one
CA root (Verisign), but after they got that working, they added
user-selected CAs as well.  Maybe MS will add this later?
