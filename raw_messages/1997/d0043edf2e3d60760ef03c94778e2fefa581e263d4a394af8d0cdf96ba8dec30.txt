Do you have any docs or transcripts from the meeting with the White House?

What is being claimed above about the current proposal and what I ahve
been hearing here are two differnet things. It was my understnding that
the current proposal was very much like the White proposal in '95.

Any clairifcation you can provide on this matter would be appreciated.

Thanks,
