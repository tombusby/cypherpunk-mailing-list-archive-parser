Good point: but I've seen a few refs from LEAs about "Drug Dealer X 
who we can't talk about" or "Child Pornographer Y who we can't talk 
about" (in lieu of cases being digested by the court system) so I 
didn't harp on that point.

A point I did leave out was that if they already knew these people 
were criminals and were building cases against them, monitoring them 
enough to know they used crypto, then do they really need to bother 
with listening in to the exact message?

I wanted to emphasize the phallacy of the sacrifical lamb of rights 
in the name of the god of security.  Also, they mungled the letter 
enough, so it's better for LI Newsday (which caters to a reading 
level of the average 12-year-old) submissions to be kept short and 
sweet.

I'm quite surprised that mine is the only letter they printed. 
Certainly they would have gotten more than one submission on a 
controversial subject?
