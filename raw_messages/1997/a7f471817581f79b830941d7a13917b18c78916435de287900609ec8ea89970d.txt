Try this Monty:

The new owner of the Monty persona is defined to be the first public
key which is signed by Monty's private key and posted to this forum.

So the buyer sends Monty a public key, and Monty signs it and posts it
to the list.  (Optionally via a trusted third party to ensure fair
play.  There is a race condition in the making there but it's not too
bad, we could fix it if we were bothered.)

So Monty can cheat and post one he signed earlier selling to a
different key, but we will ignore those because we base it on first
posted.

Buyers will no longer be interested in buying Monty's persona after
they have seen it sold, because they know it is no longer his.

The person who buys Monty's persona could resell it.  Using the same
protocol.

(As there seems to be some confusion about my public key block, here
it is again with Version field and blank line; I surmise that the
problem Bill Stewart encountered was that pgp5.0 can't handle armor
without blank lines (or maybe without blank lines and Version))
