I expect tools like this to become more and more prevelent.  Especially
amongst items listed in RISKS.  

It is my imagination or are police getting more and more lazy?  There
seems to be a desire to find the one magic bullet that will end crime as
we know it, be it AI profilers, back doored encryption, a spy camera in
every bedroom, or whatever.

It is just as bad as management that tries to find the "one true
management fad" while spending the company into the poorhouse.  (In many
ways, that is exactly the same process here.  People in charge looking for
an easy way out...)

I wonder what happens when the case does not fit the template provided...?

Anything you say can and will be used against you in a crossreferenced
database.

Of course, the investigation will only be as good as the data thrown into
it.  And if you misspoke or said something that was not 100% accurate,
that will be used against you later, when they need to wrap up the case.

Orwell in the police force, Orwell in the workplace, Orwell in the living
room...

This reads like CNN bought the company's press release whole.  This is not
reporting, this is sales!

Be afraid. Be very afraid.
