Netscape has just been awarded a major contract with the Department
of Defense for "secure" browsers, with options for "annual renewals."
One of the best ever for NSCP.

This is a public deal, as distinguished from the secret others pointed to 
in mandatory public notices in the Federal Register of meetings closed 
for national security by the Defense Science Boards, the National 
Defense Panel, and a welter of mil/gov advisory groups composed of 
members from industry, education and policy orgs eager to get advance 
word of market and contribution opportunities.
