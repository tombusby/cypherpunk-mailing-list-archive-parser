Anonymous must work for CDT or VTW or some other beltway agency. 
Even while decrying the corruption and waste in this government agency,
he feels compelled to reconstitute it with a New and Better version.

His proposition that a new agency could "help industrial competitive-
ness" and "defend us against infowar" is ludicrous and insupportable.
And how can one even keep a straight face while proposing a government
agency to help us "retain [our] freedoms"?
