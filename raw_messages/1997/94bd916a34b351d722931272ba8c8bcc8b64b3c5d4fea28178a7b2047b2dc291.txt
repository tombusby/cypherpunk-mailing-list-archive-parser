Nonsense. People use remailers for all sorts of reasons.

(Speaking for myself, and trying to be careful to not implicate myself in
further felonies, I've used the available remailers to post liberated
information of various sorts. Go back and check the archives. You'll find
that "Dumpster divings" of information from corporate conspirators (a la
Cylink, Mykotronx) was posted through anonymous remailers. Who would argue
that the cause of liberty would be better served by posting these items
under one's own name, where the Corporate State could then file lawsuits,
order midnight raids, etc.?)

As for the time to delete the Vulis spam, you must be innumerate.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
