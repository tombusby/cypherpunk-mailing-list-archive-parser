More account based $%&#!! from the US Post Office:


LibertyCash may look like a credit card, but it's not.  It's the
convenient new cash replacement card, available only from the United States
Postal Service.

No cash.  No checks.  Just a swipe of your LibertyCash Card and you're all
paid up.

The refillable card gives you the security of a PIN and is a real favorite
with the business crowd.  It's available in intial amounts from $5-$300 and
can be refilled to a maximum balance of $300.

The disposable card is perfect for your small purchases, and there's no PIN
to remember.  It's available in $10 and $20 amounts and, once it's spent,
you can throw the card away or keep it as a collectible.

Safer than cash.  Use a refillable card and we can easily replace it if
it's lost or stolen.  Just go to a participating post office, and we'll
transfer your remaining balance to a new card.  It's as simple as that.
