Bernard, thanks for an interesting post. I am Cc-ing your message to 
Cypherpunks mailing list which is ostensibly dedicated to discussions
of cryptography.

As follows from info on your home page, you do use simple XOR to
encrypt your data. It was not clear to me though, how do you generate
the keys to encrypt the data. I am sure that many readers of cypherpunks
mailing list will be interested, so please send a copy of your reply
to cypherpunks@toad.com.

igor
