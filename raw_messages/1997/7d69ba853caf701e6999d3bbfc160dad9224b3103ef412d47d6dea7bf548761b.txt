Yay!  It's officially non-exportable.  It would be kind of fun to
observe a lawsuit built around someone in the US using this as a .sig:

: Have *you* exported RSA today? --> http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/rsa/
: 
: print pack"C*",split/\D+/,`echo "16iII*o\U@{$/=$z;[(pop,pop,unpack"H*",<>
: )]}\EsMsKsN0[lN*1lK[d2%Sa2/d0<X+d*lMLa^*lN%0]dsXx++lMlN/dsM0<J]dsJxp"|dc`
 
Perhaps they should round up all those who have used it in the past as
a .sig and lock them up.

I must admit to being very curious as to how html links can be an
export.

Is this an export?

	RSA .sig

Is this?

	PGP 5.0i

(guessing URL).

This one might be fun also, but still I can't see that it's an export:

	<IMG SRC="http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/shirt/rsa.gif">

(it's an inline image of the RSA .sig).

Weird so this is exportable (otp.c):

main(i,c)int*c;{for(c=fopen(c[1],"r");i=~getchar();putchar(getc(c)^~i));}

Here's a perl one too btw:

open P,shift;read(P,$p,length),print $_^$p while<>
