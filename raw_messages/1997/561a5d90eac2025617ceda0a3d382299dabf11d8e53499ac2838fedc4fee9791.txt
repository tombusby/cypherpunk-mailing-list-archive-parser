I was thinking if the money spent lobbying had been offered as prize
money for breaking crap crypto, it might have had more effect.

Or perhaps as a bribe to obtain the LEAF family key or indeed the NSAs
master copy of the database, or both copies of the split database.

Even just burning the money would probably have been better for the
crypto cause, than feeding the shysters.
