[Tim posted his article on identity, etc. to cypherpunks and nym;
the discussion I'm replying to is primarily on cypherpunks.]

A third category of requirement is displaying the particular form of 
identification if you're carrying it - for instance, if you're driving,
and carrying a driver's license, you're obligated to display it,
but if you're walking or a passenger, you're not generally required to,
but some states (in particular California) require that 
if you're carrying a driver's license you're obligated to show it to 
any cop who asks.  I don't know if the requirements include 
handing it over or just displaying.

But lying and refusing to cooperate are different; 
"You can call me John Doe if you'd like" is not a lie, 
and Supreme Court cases like Brown vs. Texas have determined that you 
don't have to tell the police who you are even if they're booking you.
On the other hand, the Supremes let police hold you for up to 48 hours
for no particularly good reason (they have a more formal definition 
than that :-) so exercising your rights may have a cost.

Tim brings up the issue of identity papers for jury duty -
even if you feel like confusing the poor court bureaucrats
by not bringing the PhotoID with SSN, Thumbprint, and DNA sample,
there's probably a requirement to bring the jury duty summons.
(Depending on your motives, your FIJA membership card is a good backup
ID, or your ACLU card if you've got one - don't leave home without it.)
