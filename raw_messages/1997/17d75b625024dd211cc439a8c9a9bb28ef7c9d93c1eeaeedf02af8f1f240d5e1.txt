Some of the questions by Mark Rogaski and others ask about the nature of
the revolution I and others are predicting and encouraging.

What will a just revolution, like those anticipated by Jefferson, Franklin,
and others, look like?

The British thought the colonial rebels were "playing dirty" by shooting
from behind trees instead of marching in bright uniforms with drums and
bugles to herald their way.

Modern armies think freedom fighters are "terrorist scum" for not fighting
honestly and fairly in their own M-1 Abrams tanks and aircraft carriers.

So, too, will revolutionaries be seen as fighting "unfairly" and being
unethical sneaks, child killers, and terrorists.

(As if children and other innocents did not die in various incidents in
past wars, on all sides.)

When Jefferson predicted that a revolution was needed every 20 years or so,
he surely was not saying that throwing one party out of leadership and
putting the other party in was an example of such a revolution, or that
"campaign reform" is such an example. Nor was he saying that the only valid
revolution would be when a buch of citizens or states got together their
own army and marched on Washington.

(Actually, raising such an army is in violation of numerous laws about
heavy weaons, licenses to carry weapons, etc. No doubt illegal. Ironically.)

No, the revolution, when it comes, will likely be different from anything
quite like we've seen to date.
