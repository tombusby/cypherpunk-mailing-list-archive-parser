Whoa there Bill.  They have customers who wanted data recovery.  Data
recovery does not require CMR.

Did they admit to customers who wanted human based email screening?
No on list discussions have suggested this is the case.  I think I saw
one PGP employee state that it was not the case.

(I have perfectly good, more secure CDR based human screening designs,
not that I encourage this you understand).

Small difference I think.

Nothing against SMTP filters, just against the CMR enforcement they
put into theirs.

You're using "you can hack around it" and "it is visible" arguments,
these are valid arguments which mitigate the danger, but don't
actually alter Tim and my points that storage recovery is less of a
problem than message recovery.

He made the same point in both respects.  I agree with his point about
openPGP.

I fully agree with Tim's points and Bill Frantz's example that old
email messages come back to haunt people and are a nightmare waiting
for a discovery process in a messy lawsuit for companies.  I nearly
got sucked into such a thing myself last year (some one gave back a
laptop to a company they just quit on bad terms from, tried to wipe it
but left some messages on it; the messages looked _bad_, the idiot who
did that sent the _bad_ message to me, my response was to phone him up
and say `what _are_ you talking about, I can't do that'.).

This to me argues that PGP Inc should make email archives user
controllable.  So that users decide which emails to archive and which
to just let naturally disappear, in the same way that phone calls, or
chats in a restaurant aren't transcibed and digitally signed.  Much
harder to prove.  I would also argue for "official statement" vs "chit
chat" distinction on emails -- don't archive, and certainly don't have
recovery of chit chat, use non-transferable sigs for chit chat, the
only person who cares about authenticity is the recipient, not the
legal system.  So I think this aspect belongs in coding in ways which
are beneficial to companies.

I guess the smtp filters leave stuff alone if they can't figure out
who it's to?  ie do default email thang -- which is probably what you
want if it's some privacy nut who is sending a "chit chat" class
message to one of your set of sales people.  don't do the explode to
all feature.

Sure.  It's also completely understandable that they do have financial
restrictions, my main argument was that they could build more GAK
resistant systems within those restrictions.

Yes, but you are in the US.  The recipient is in tinpotdictatorsville.
With pgp5.0 your software will by default honour the military police's
demand in tinpotdictatorsville.

This is why I am arguing that the system as a whole be considered --
you are trying to build GAK resistance into the deployed code base you
have to think long term and you have to think in terms of sabotaging
the system to make it unuseful to governments.

Consider also that software gets used in it's default configuration
95% of the time.  Not everyone is a information architect :-)

OK, well that's some monkeywrenching, but I guess that could be
prevented with some design reviews.  I won't be helping with those
design reviews -- any company who wants to improve enforcement of CMR
type designs can figure them out for themselves.
