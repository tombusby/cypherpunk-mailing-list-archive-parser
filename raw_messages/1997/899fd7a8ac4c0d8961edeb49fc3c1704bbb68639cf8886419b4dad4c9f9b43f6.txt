Actually, in many jurisdictions, flame-throwers are NOT illegal. Legally
defining the difference between a "flamethrower", an "acetylene torch", a
"cigarette lighter" a "portable gas grill", and various other common
fire-producing items is even stickier than legally defining an "assault
weapon" or a "Saturday night special". Besides, flamethrowers are not yet
the weapon of choice for drug dealers, terrorists, child pornographers, and
muggers, so most otherwise anti-2nd amendment legislators haven't thought
to make them illegal. (Ever hear of a drive-by flamethrowing?)
Besides, you can make your own flamethrower out of a push-button butane
lighter (the kind that makes a spark to light the butane) and one of those
pump-up pressure sprayers available at Home Depot or Sears, as long as it
has a metal wand/nozzle assembly. All you need to do is attach the lighter
to the wand in a manner that prevents liquid from the nozzle from dripping
on your hand, drill the nozzle out so it produces a stream instead of a
mist, and fill the sprayer up with gasoline. Pump it up, and you have an
untraceable (if you buy the materials with cash) short-range riot
suppression tool for less than $30, including the gasoline to fill it.

If you want to get really nasty, mix some styrofoam in with the gasoline so
it starts becoming sticky. (Can you say napalm?) Of course, making the
gasoline too viscous will reduce its ability to be sprayed, so experiment
before using in a critical situation to determine the optimum balance
between desired burn characteristics and sprayability.

What part of "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
