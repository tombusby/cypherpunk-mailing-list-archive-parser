COURT REAFFIRMS GOVERNMENT^RS INTEREST IN PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM 
PORN, BUT STRIKES CDA AS TOO BROAD


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- "Today^Rs ruling means that pornographers can 
open their doors to children on the Internet.  But pornographers 
beware:  this will not be the last word on protecting children 
from your corrupting influence," Family Research Council Legal 
Policy Director Cathy Cleaver said Thursday.  "While Reno v. ACLU 
said that the specific provisions of the CDA are too broad, the 
Court also said that more narrowly tailored provisions could be 
upheld."

Cleaver made her comments as the Supreme Court issued its ruling 
striking down the Communications Decency Act (CDA).  Cleaver 
continued, "Parents still have no legal recourse to protect their 
children from being sent a Penthouse centerfold.  This is not 
good news for the thousands of families who discover every day 
that their children have accessed offensive and disgusting 
material on the internet. 

"At the same time, the Court has opened the door to new 
legislation protection children.  Americans should urge Congress 
to take another look at the issue and draft a more narrowly 
defined statute.

"But now, the flood gates remain open to purveyors of smut.  With 
no legal liability for those who pursue children with graphic 
images and language on the internet, we need to act fast and 
firmly to ensure that our country does not give pornographers 
special rights."
