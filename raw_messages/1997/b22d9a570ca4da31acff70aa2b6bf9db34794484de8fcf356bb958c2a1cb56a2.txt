If they ask you questions regarding the commission of a crime the 5th will
not protect you unless you were involved. The flip side to this that
protects this 'hole' from being catastrophic is that you don't have to talk
to the police at all unless accussed of a crime. They most certainly can
take physical evidence from 3rd parties (ie hostile witnesses) which they
believe are involved in some manner with the crime (ie entering your
apartment to track the path of a bullet in the hopes of retrieving it).
Refusing to answer the questions of the prosecutor while under oath has its
own consequences. What really keeps it from getting out of hand is the cost
of interviewing and calling all possible witnesses to some crime. Just
imagine calling everyone on the floor of a murder as SOP.

As I understand it that is correct.

If they are truly innocent, what could they possibly have to say other than
"Please find the killer of our daughter" and "We didn't do it." Innocent
people have little to say, the guilty need to convince us of their
innocence.

"Me thinks he protest too much."
