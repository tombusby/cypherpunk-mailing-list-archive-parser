watching the screen either].

You first of all extract your a PGP key with pgpacket.  (You'll need
to change the password to be no password (press enter when prompted
for password), so that PGP doesn't encrypt the private key.

Next, you can do:

	% perl rsa.pl [e] [n] < plaintext > ciphertext
	% perl rsa.pl [d] [n] < plaintext > ciphertext

to encrypt and decrypt.

Here's a small example (Fred is a notional eternity user who's key,
both public and private is included in the eternity distribution):

Fred's public key:

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6.3i

mQBNAzPfUPsAAAECAMn6jtL3ZNjmBrkDLIktHNmBGc+a59BSvFPN8howj5zAj1U8

/pXOSh8Rf9pTsF2TbsAKIK4xL9PzYoicy/KAZdIN+AJO8dX/xY0a1v5A8xobeg==
=iWoN
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

Fred's secret key (no password):

-----BEGIN PGP SECRET KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6.3i

lQD4AzPfUPsAAAECAMn6jtL3ZNjmBrkDLIktHNmBGc+a59BSvFPN8howj5zAj1U8

-----END PGP SECRET KEY BLOCK-----

(to extract public key do:

% pgp -kxa fred fredpub ~/.pgp/pubring.pgp 

and to get private key do:

% pgp -kxa fred fredpri ~/.pgp/secring.pgp 

)

Next get pgpacket.pl, see ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/pgp/utils/ or
something like that.

Then run pgpacket on the fredpri.asc (it contains all the info that
you want, without looking at fredpub.asc, ie the values for e, d and
n):

% pgpacket fredpri.asc

The values for e, d, and n are:

e = 11
d = 043E45B0886C9B2519F4D3F74144B6633991C098C4550C7E940BDB22F86A470E
    C3ACE7F78B6CAE8652A99B5971B82382DA771450CFF9E9950FA509560F79CADB
n = C9FA8ED2F764D8E606B9032C892D1CD98119CF9AE7D052BC53CDF21A308F9CC0
    8F553CE5039F56D57890E9622B602409C2F6CB2CF75B3F801E261D572B90245D

Now you can encrypt for fred like so:

% echo hello world | perl rsa.pl 11 C9FA8ED2F764D8E606B9032C892D1CD98119CF9AE7D052BC53CDF21A308F9CC08F553CE5039F56D57890E9622B602409C2F6CB2CF75B3F801E261D572B90245D > hello.rsa
%

and to decrypt:

% perl rsa.pl 043E45B0886C9B2519F4D3F74144B6633991C098C4550C7E940BDB22F86A470EC3ACE7F78B6CAE8652A99B5971B82382DA771450CFF9E9950FA509560F79CADB C9FA8ED2F764D8E606B9032C892D1CD98119CF9AE7D052BC53CDF21A308F9CC08F553CE5039F56D57890E9622B602409C2F6CB2CF75B3F801E261D572B90245D < hello.rsa
hello world
%

Now dc can do modular exponentiation like so (reverse polish notation):

dc> m e ^ n %

but that's going to take a long time because it will evaluate m ^ e
and then do mod n.

So the clever thing that the program does is to implement Knuth's
modexp algorithm which reduces the work factor immensly. 

Actually GNU dc 1.1 (distributed with GNU bc-1.04) now includes "|" as
a modular exponentiation operator, so you can do: "m e n |" and it'll
do it directly.  This feature was a special, just for perl rsa because
Ken Pizzini, author of GNU dc, happens to be one of the major
contributors of hacks to shorten the perl program, and so have a
vested interest.

With the dc 1.1 | operator, Ken got the script down to:

$/=$z;exec"dc -e'16i0[lN*lMlKlN|+lMlN/dsM0<J]dsJ\U@{[
pop,pop,unpack'H*',<>]}\EsMsKsNx[II*~aSad0<ZLaP]dsZx'"

a considerable improvement over:

print pack"C*",split/\D+/,`echo "16iII*o\U@{$/=$z;[(pop,pop,unpack"H*",<>
)]}\EsMsKsN0[lN*1lK[d2%Sa2/d0<X+d*lMLa^*lN%0]dsXx++lMlN/dsM0<J]dsJxp"|dc`

I'd find it most cool to hear an audio file of the above.
