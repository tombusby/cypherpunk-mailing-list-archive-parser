Theodor Schlickmann and Peter Trei have expressed some skepticism
regarding the 2048-bit number which I believe can be factored.

I confess that I do not know the exact method required, but I am
pretty sure it exists.

Hint 1: The method will not work to factor 2048-bit numbers in the
general case.

Hint 2: There is an observation which suggests the number may be
factored.  A one word hint will reveal this observation.

(I want to hold off on Hint 3 for a little while in case somebody is
already working on the problem.  If anybody wants me to withhold Hint
3, please post a message to the list and I may do so.  It seems to me
that it will be more fun to solve without Hint 3.)

Wouldn't it be neat to actually factor a 2048-bit number which was the
product of two large primes?
