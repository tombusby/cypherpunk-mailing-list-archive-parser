  That's right. We should not support "wrong" people. So first H-B
needs to demean Jim Bell personally.

  And we should not support "bad" people, so H-B also needs to
criminalize Jim Bell by vague innuendo.

  Why risk your own neck supporting a loon?

  Sure, maybe he didn't actually commit a crime, but he pushed
the envelope, so he made his own troubles.

  It's best to do nothing, because it's not you. It's a loon.
It's someone who probably did something illegal, even if it
wasn't what he was charged with (because we're all guilty of
something).
  So now H-B has given the individual cypherpunks "reasons"
not to support Jim Bell, or to protest his persecution.

  So what if Jim Bell is a cypherpunk to the core? So what if
he is being prosecuted for speaking of things that many of us
have spoken about and debated on the list?
  There are sounds of gunfire coming from our neighbor's house.
Let's just close the window and hope that the trouble doesn't
come our way.
