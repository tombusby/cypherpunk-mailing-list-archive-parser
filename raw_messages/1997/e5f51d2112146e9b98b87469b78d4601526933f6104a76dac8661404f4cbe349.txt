Hi guys,

What's this product all in all ? Has this now replaced F-Secure SSH or is
this one additional derivative of SSH a'la ISP SSH ?

Are the features same as for the most recent SSH clients/servers ? HOw does
this product differ from SSH ?

Any data sheets ?

Is the software

a) shipping
b) downloadable from the web ?

Does this configure itself automatically for most popular office apps as
discussed some time earlier, or do admins still need to do the installation
manually for each computer or count on users doing this themselves ?
