I'm a little confused by your use of the term 'SSL proxy'. Netscape 
defined an extension to HTTP to allow SSL traffic through a firewall:
the encrypted request is prepended (in clear) with the actual 
destination IP address and port. The firewall proxy then opens a 
TCP/IP channel to the actual destination/port, and blindly relays packets
between the actual destination and the browser until one side or the
other shuts down the link.

The proxy does no encryption or decryption - in fact, it requires no 
crypto code at all. 

(BTW: this what setting the 'security proxy' field in Netscape is 
all about).

The scheme has some drawbacks 

- there is no provision for chaining proxies. 
- the server can't determine the source browser's IP - it only sees 
  the proxy's IP address. This makes it more difficult to filter 
  requests based on source ID.
- the proxy has no idea of the actual URL requested - proxies which
  want to filter or log requests based on URL can't do so.

Or are you talking about something entirely different?
