Tell me what this has to do with cryptography, and I'll give you a nickle.

Or, maybe not...

    "Although we may not know it, we have, in our day, witnessed the birth
    of the Therapeutic State.  This is perhaps the major implication of
    psychiatry as an institution of social control."  (Thomas Szasz, 1963)

    NUVUPSY is a forum to share points of view critical of the "therapeutic
    state" and institutional psychiatry, and those supportive of contractual
    psychotherapy and psychiatry.  We're interested in discussions concerning
    the relationship between liberty and responsibility and its implications
    for clinical, legal, and public policy.  The list will serve to promote
    alternative views to explaining unwanted behaviors.

    Sociological perspectives on the medicalization of deviant behavior are
    welcome.  Other topics for discussion include but are not limited to:
    The myth of addiction as a disease;  the ideology of biological
    determinism;  the obsolescence of the schizophrenia hypothesis;  coerced
    treatment for addiction and First Amendment rights;  criticism
    of psychiatric drug prescriptions;  etc.

    NUVUPSY Board of Advisors include:  Bruce K. Alexander, Phil Brown,
    Robert C. Carson, David J. Essex, Louis B. Fierman, Robert E. Haskell,
    Reid Klion, James C. Mancuso, Roberta Russell, Theodore R. Sarbin,
    Jeffrey A. Schaler, and Richard E. Vatz.
