That's a problem only if we expect remailers to stay up only for a few days
at a time.  I'm sure such guerilla remailers will exist, but will they be
the dominant type of remailers?

I suspect that a company that didn't allow access to a news server would
also not allow you to run a remailer behind their firewall.

But then we're back to the problem of having a centralized service that can
be attacked.  I suppose it's unavoidable.  Let's hope we at least have many
different pinging services.

I just had a thought.  Run a pinging service through the eternity servers.



Anyway, in private email, the thought of digital postage stamps has come
up.  Are there any ecash system that offer total payer anonymity (payee
anonymity is not absolutely necessary here)?
