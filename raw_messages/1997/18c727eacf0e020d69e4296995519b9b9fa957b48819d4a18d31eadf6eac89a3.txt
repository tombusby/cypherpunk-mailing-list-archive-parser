J/CRYPTO - Cryptography class library

Baltimore Technologies shipped the first copies of its Java
cryptography product J/CRYPTO at the Java Users Group meeting at
Communications '97. J/CRYPTO is the world's first cryptography class
library written entirely in Java and implements RSA, DES, Triple-DES,
SHA1, MD5, Diffie-Hellman and other common cryptographic functions. It
plugs into the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) and will comply
with Sun's Java Cryptography Extension (JCE).

J/Crypto includes a range of Java classes including: 

highly optimized Multi-Precision Arithmetic Modules;
cryptographically secure Pseudo-Random Number Generation; RSA
key generation & encryption; SHA-1 & MD5 Hashing; DES and
Triple-DES encryption; Diffie Hellman Key Exchange Mechanism.



J/Crypto includes many advanced features which provide commercial
grade security for applications. These features include:

full-strength key sizes (512,1024, 2048 bit RSA keys, 112-bit
Triple-DES); fast format RSA keys (Chinese remainder theorem &
Fermat-4); eeeelimination of weak & possibly weak DES & RSA keys;
bfuscation of secret keys and other sensitive data;
compatibility with PKCS #1, #3, #5, #8, #11; sample applications
and benchmarking.



Future developments for J/CRYPTO include implementation of Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL), IDEA, RC2, RC4, BSA4, BSA5 ciphers and a range of
high-speed stream ciphers.
