  Since the government was incapable of protecting either the people
at Waco or those at OKC, then who exactly are they protecting?

  We consider them Branch Davadians.

  This was before Dan Rather and Kookie Roberts became "the ultimate

their primary interest is in making sure that the citizens don't "have
a cow" during their broadcast.

Executive Order. And, in the lighter side of the news..." <cut to

about.
If we could get the writings made into a TV movie (or a cartoon), there
might be a minute chance to get the American public to understand, as
well.
