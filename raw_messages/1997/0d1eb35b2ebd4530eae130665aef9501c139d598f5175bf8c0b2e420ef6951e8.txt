It is possible, but more difficult.  A system that just chains and encrypts
through several different proxies keeps the traffic secret, but reveals
the source and destination of every connection using traffic analysis.  The
NRL Onion Router scheme had this problem, I think.  The way to avoid this
is to maintain constant connections between proxies and endpoints.
