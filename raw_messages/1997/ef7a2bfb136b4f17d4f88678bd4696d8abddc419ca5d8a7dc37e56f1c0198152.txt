Yes, that's illegal, unless you get permission for the export. Getting
permission requires jumping through many hoops, and is far from a sure thing.
(It's easier to count on not getting permission. You almost certainly won't
get permission if you want to use >40 bits and you're not going to force your
customers to share their keys with the government.) 

Consequently, the US is a bad place to write crypto software if you want to
make it available worldwide.

Data which may be exported as plaintext may be exported as ciphertext. Data
which may not be exported as plaintext may not be exported as ciphertext. But
in the latter case, it's harder to catch you. :)
