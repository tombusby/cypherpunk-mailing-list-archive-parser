I have no idea whether members of this list are interested in these kinds
of jobs, but hey, can't hurt to ask.

For the next 3 months (until April 30), Farallon Communications is trying
to focus on filling several key engineering positions in the Netopia and
LAN groups.  (Netopia is a product line of ISDN devices)  My wife works at
Farallon in product marketing for Netopia stuff.  They started out as a
Macintosh networking company and have gone "Internet."

Firmware Engineers:  3 for Netopia and 1 for LAN

Hardware Engineers:  1 for Netopia and 1 for LAN

There is some flexibility for the firmware positions to work either in
Alameda or San Jose.  I'm not sure about the job descriptions; I just
looked at http://www.farallon.com/corp/jobs/index.html and this might
accurately describe some of the positions mentioned above:

Sr. Staff Engineer (WAN) -- San Jose and Alameda
4 Openings
Senior member of the software development team responsible for
architecture, design and implementation of embedded systems
firmware on new and existing WAN products. Hands-on design
position requiring a BSCS or a BSEE with advanced degree preferred.
The ideal candidate will have 10+ years networking or
telecommunications development experience and expert knowledge of
multi-protocol routing and bridging. Expertise in networking layer
technologies/protocols and data compression required.
