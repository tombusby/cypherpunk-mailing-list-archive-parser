        when AIDS was relatively obscure, I always dismissed AIDS as 
    God's response to homosexuality (and other crimes against nature); 
    i.e. -settlement by a just God.  

        Unfortunately, some of these boy-girls could not keep it among 
    themselves, and the closet queens brought it home.  AIDS replicates     
    asexually, knowing no boundaries.

        I would not wish the disease upon anyone, but if you play, you 
    just might pay --as in "...reap what thy hath sown."  

        One of the saddest commentaries on the entire problem is the 
    man, a Pan-American flight steward, who was identified as carrier 
    #1 by the Communicable Disease Center (CDC) in Atlanta; he died 
    protesting he did not have the disease, nor was he a carrier. The 
    flight steward was still sexually active until his impending death 
    removed even his ability to passively participate. Unfortunately, 
    he was not only in total denial as to the disease and its 
    communicability, but he was also immensely profligate, having 
    surrendered to total licentiousnous.

        To be strongly opposed to homosexuality has nothing to do with 
    bigotry, political correctness, or aberrationist apologists; it is
    an exposition of the natural order among the species.

        and for those who deny God, read Darwin as to the relative 
    rate of survival for deviant and/or abnormal species.
