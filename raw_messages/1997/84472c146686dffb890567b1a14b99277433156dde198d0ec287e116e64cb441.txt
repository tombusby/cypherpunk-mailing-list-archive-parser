The fact that it will now be controlled from Anguilla is particularly
tasty.

Dear Friends, 

It is with mixed emotions that I bring you news as to the future of
PublicData.com.  First let me tell you that we appreciate all of the
letters of support that you have sent.  During the many days of
confusion, your kind letters help us to remain focused on the tasks at
hand. 

Our company ShadowSoft, Inc. publishes Public Records CDs and we
specialize in consulting or contracting with databases (preferably
large databases).  ShadowSoft was approached around the end on 1996
and was asked if we could place our public records databases on the
Internet.  After a little bit of tinkering the basic model that you
see at PublicData.com was developed. 

ShadowSoft is staffed with the best technical people in the  
industry but we don't have skills in the area of marketing. 
It has been our desire all along to simply be the technical and 
database contractor for someone who wished to run the business  
of marketing and merchandising PublicData.com.  A law passed by 
the Texas legislature this year banning the distribution of public
data records over the Internet has made finding a merchandiser
difficult and has made us re-think our position.  I have made the
decision that ShadowSoft shall cease operating PublicData.com on
August 31, 1997. 

Because of my own personal belief that keeping public records  
available to the public in a free society is critical and essential to
keeping our country free, ShadowSoft has sold PublicData.com to a
company based in Anguilla, British West Indies.  The company which is
named PublicData.com.ai Ltd. has purchased all of the programs that
ShadowSoft developed which gives you access to the information over
the Internet.  In addition, ShadowSoft will  consult for
PublicData.com but our data was not sold to them  as a part of our
deal.  Instead, PublicData.com has purchased another copy of the same
databases and should be able to provide uninterrupted service to you
after September 1, 1997. 

The new owners of PublicData.com should be sending you a note 
very soon.  Thanks again for all of your support and please consider 
keeping a subscription with PublicData.com. 

Sincerely, 

Bruce 
President 

ShadowSoft, Inc.
