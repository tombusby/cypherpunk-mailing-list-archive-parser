Remailers are here to help the weak against the powerful.

I use em 10 times a day.

A many a Christian bunghole forgets that instead of forcing their god down
people's throats, (Tyranny of the MINORITY) they should make an effort to

I've heard shit like that often from politicians.

Which describes my similar views of the growing socialism in America.
