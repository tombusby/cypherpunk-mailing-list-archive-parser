I'll bet he wears a badge with his full name, street address, and home
phone number when he walks down the street so as not to "hide behind"
his otherwise anonymous clothing! <g>  (Everyone is entitled to know
the identity of everyone else, right?)

I'm familiar with the role of Gary Burnore <gburnore@netcom.com> and that
of his DataBasix associates Belinda Bryan <eridani@ix.netcom.com> and Billy
McClatchie (aka "Wotan") <wmcclatc@primenet.com> in getting the Mailmasher
and Huge Cajones remailers shut down.  Jeff Burchell posted a public
expose' of their harassment to Usenet back in June, apparently catching the
DataBasix folks off-guard.  But what's the story with Paul Pomes?  What has 
he done?

Perhaps the best thing that can be done with people like Burnore is to put
together an FAQ about their tactics, similar to what his "fans" have done
for the "Rev." Steve Winter.  Then when Burnore tries to stir up trouble by
first fabricating anonymous "abuse" and then demanding that it either be 
stopped and the culprit(s) identified (knowing in advance that's 
impossible), or else that the remailer be shut down, someone can forward 
that FAQ to the remailer's upstream provider, or whoever is being pressured 
to pull the plug.  And if Paul Pomes engages in the same dishonest tactics, 
that needs to be done with him as well.
