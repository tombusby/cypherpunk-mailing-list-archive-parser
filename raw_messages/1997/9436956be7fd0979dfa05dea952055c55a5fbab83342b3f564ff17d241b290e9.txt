Windows NT 4.0, with Microsoft's Client Services for Netware, or
Novell's IntraNetware Client for Windows NT, writes plain-text user-id
and password information to PAGEFILE.SYS.  The user-id and password
apply to Netware, however, users commonly use the same logon information
for both NT and Netware.  It is possible to then recover the plain-text
information by using a disk editor.

Tests have been performed  (with more pending) on these systems:

Windows NT Workstation 4.0 w/SP1 and IntraNetware Client for NT (970214)
     Pent. 133 Laptop  24MB RAM  50MB PAGEFILE.SYS
Windows NT Workstation 4.0 w/SP1 and Microsoft Client Services for
Netware
     Dual Pent 166   64MB RAM  80MB PAGEFILE.SYS
Novell Netware 4.11 Server

1.  Set /MAXMEM=12 in BOOT.INI so as to force swapping.
2.  Load NT; Authenticate to NT and Netware (I used the same ID and
Password for both systems.); Verify connection by mapping a drive.
3.  To ensure that sufficient swapping takes place, run a large program
(this forces the user-id and password information stored in RAM to be
placed into PAGEFILE.SYS.)
4.  Exit NT; Boot to DOS; diskedit PAGEFILE.SYS
5.  Search for one of the following strings (do NOT include the ""
items):

 IntraNetware Client:   
     NWUserName="user-id"
     WlMprNotifyPassword="password"
     "UserName"    (if the username is alone, the password will follow
very closely)

 Client Services for Netware
     nwcs"password"    (the password is all CAPS and will immediately
follow nwcs)

In a "real-life" environment, most likely there will be enough swapping
on the system that setting the /MAXMEM switch will be unnecessary.  The
switch is only to help confirm that this hole exits.

If anyone has any knowledge of this, please post it to the list.
