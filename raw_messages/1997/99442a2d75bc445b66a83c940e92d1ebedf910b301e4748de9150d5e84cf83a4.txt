I don't know where you get the above from?

I supose that your statest brainwashing has convinced you that such social
issues could have only been resolved by Federal intervention. Quite the
contrary is true. Any laws passed by congress in these areas were brought
about *because* society was already moving in those directions not the
other way around.

If someone is going to descriminate on the basis of race or sex or any
other criteria they are going to do so reguardless of what laws are passed
in DC.
