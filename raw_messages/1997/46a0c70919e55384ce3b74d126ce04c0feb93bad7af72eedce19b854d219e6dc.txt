Two news reports on Big Bro e-cards:

1.  E-Pass -- a UK product that is both smart card and PC,
will have one or more screens, and hopes to dominate 
the global government and business market for 
all-CU-data-in-one-easily-tracked-device.

2. Proton -- Belgium's cartel card, the mostly widely
used device to en-SAFE Belgians, and a candidate
to be recruited by Visa or MasterCard or Mondex or 
Halliburton or Armadillo US/UK/AUS.

And a report on a speed demon crypto card from Eracom
in AU, which claims to be "the world's first PC-based 
PCI bus cryptographic processor which can punch through
cryptographic traffic at up to 30 times the speed of ISA bus
products."
