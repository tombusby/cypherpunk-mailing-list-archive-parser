AMERICA ONLINE'S LITTLE PROBLEM
By Michael D. Lemonick
Reported by Bruce van Voorst and Declan McCullagh/Washington

   If you logged on to America Online last week, you may well have found
   E-mail waiting from someone you never heard of imploring you to JOIN
   US AT PINK PUSSY CLUB THE HOTTEST SITE FOR XXX LIVE GIRL SEX SHOWS!!
   or proclaiming OVER 1,000 EROTIC AND EXOTIC SHOWS!!!!!! CLICK HERE TO
   ENTER or any of hundreds of similar electronic come-ons.

   Spam--unsolicited junk E-mail--is perhaps the most irritating feature
   of online life. Its purveyors use powerful software to "harvest"
   screen names and then ship out bulk electronic mail bearing sales
   pitches or get-rich-quick schemes.
