Testimonial

" I got two bids on my roof for two leaks we had last winter. I was almost ready to get the roof replaced when I saw the ad for Jim's guide. I'm so glad I bought it! After about 10 minutes I knew I needed to find another roofer and get a third bid. After following the simple check list I almost found the leak my self and I was able to point out where it was coming from to the new contractor. He replaced two vent boots and my roof has not leaked since. Not only did I save over $2,200.00 by reading this guide but, I also got rid of some stains as well. THANKS JIM!!"
