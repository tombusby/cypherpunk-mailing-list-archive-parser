While at first glance the LA riots may be an example in your favor but
under closer inspection one can see that it is not.

To show my point take a look at the stores that were looted and burned.
While the unarmed store owners sat and watched their lifes work go up in
smoke the ones who were armed and kept watch from their rooftops were able
to save themselfs and their property.

And where were are beloved Police? Hiding elseware eating thier donuts
becuse they were too *chicken shit* to do thier job. It only goes to show
that when the chips are really down you can not count on the government to
save you.

I don't know what happend in other towns durring the riots but where I was
at we orginised a large group of arms citizens and made it well know that
such actions would not be tolarated.

And before anyone ask yes I think that every rat bastard involved in the
riots should have been shot on sight.
