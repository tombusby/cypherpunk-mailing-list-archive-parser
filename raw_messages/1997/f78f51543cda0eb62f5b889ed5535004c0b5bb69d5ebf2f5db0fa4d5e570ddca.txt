Host:  Many thanks to Richard Graves <llurch@stanford.edu> and to
	Stanford University for providing the space for this months
	meeting.

Notes:	  We will have a small NHK (Nipon(Japan)) film crew at much of
	this meeting, they are doing a documentary and are interested
	in how this (main) branch cypherpunks works (or does not work
	as the case may be...).
	  We have a wonderful space to do demos in this month, Turing
	Auditorium has Internet, projections screens, audio amps and
	a Clone-PC and a Macintosh to demo software, web sites etc.
	  If you have something Cypherpunkish to demo, this is the
	month to do so!
