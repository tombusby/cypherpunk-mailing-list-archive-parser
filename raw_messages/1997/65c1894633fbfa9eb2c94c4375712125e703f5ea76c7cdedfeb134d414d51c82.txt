What is a reasonable summary? Reasonable to who? What 'lot' of democracies?

No, but you certainly imply it with your broad brush.

Again, demostrate your assertion(s).

If you don't understand it you can't use it, effectively or otherwise.

No, my responce is prove your assertions. Explain to me why you believe
these are valid views and why they provide a more usable environment for
understanding what is going on then others.

true either.

Really? What was the law count say in 1865 versus 1965? 1897 v 1997?
Demonstrate your point.
