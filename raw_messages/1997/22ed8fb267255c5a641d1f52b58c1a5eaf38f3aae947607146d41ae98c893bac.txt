I have seen in the paper where a person has been convicted of using a
scanner in the commition of a felony.  In my opinion, this is exactly how
crypto would be a crime, when using it in the commission of another crime.
In most cases, it seems, the scanner is used to monitor the police bands so
that the criminals will have advance warning when to hide thier actions.  Of
course, around here, a person owning a scanner for monitoring the police and
fire bands is normal.  It is just one more way of gathering news.
Please correct me if any of my facts are in error.
