I suspect the visitors to abortion clinics would agree with you. I doubt
the right-to-lifers or the judge would. Pleasure and good ideas are not
necessarily one-to-one.

One could argue that just as we must pave public sidewalks and roads as well
as provide publicly accessible sewer pipes we might be required to provide
webspace on the endpoint routers of the public sections of the backbone, and
then we ALL get to pay for our daily aggravation ("push the button to torture
the subject", subject pushes button and spasms in electric agony). Perhaps
that is the real reason it would bite.

Hmmm, I have NEVER seen einstein go anywhere nor the cables it is connected
to. I can certainly say that I doubt the hundreds of machines in my work lab
cavort around the shop when I am gone. No, I don't accept your premise that
the connections in the Internet are that mobile.

Lack of public space may be the saving grace, unfortunately there is quite
a bit of involvment planned by Uncle Sam if I am not mistaken...Internet II...
V-II Chip... GAK... ITAR... That supercomputer science network thingy...

Get the picture?

You can certainly stand in front of that store on the public street and
offer to give said material away (remember to pick those up people throw
down). And there ain't a damn thing you can do to make them leave.

I would hope you would explain and address the counter-arguments of your
critics. Otherwise your discussions might be a little one sides and hopefuly
quite short. I personaly hate monotonic lunatic raves (unless there is a
kick-ass band and pretty women).
