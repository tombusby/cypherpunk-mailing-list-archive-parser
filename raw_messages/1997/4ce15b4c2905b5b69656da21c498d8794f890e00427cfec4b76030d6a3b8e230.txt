I wonder how many of these companies signed up
"just to appear on the list".

Apple, as far as I know, has no GAK project in place.
In fact, as far as I know, the last GAK-related action
that anyone at Apple has participated, was to participate in
the original press release.

This is not meant as a defense of Apple. I have discussed
their support of this organization with senior management there,
and tried to convince them of the errors of their ways. Rather,
it is a comment on their current activities regarding GAK.

Apple also happens to be the one company on that list that
I have non-public knowledge of.
