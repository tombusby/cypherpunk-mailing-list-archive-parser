I should add that they haven't done anything in the field of cryptographic 
or technology issues, but have focused most of their efforts on protecting 
small entrepreneurs from overly zealous government agencies, particularly on 
the local level.  One item I found of particular interest was a report they 
published in July 1996 about the restrictive barriers New York City has 
erected to prevent entrepreneurship (i.e., expensive/restrictive licensing 
fees, tough penalties for doing business without the required permits, 
etc.).  An earlier post on this list referred to NYC as a cesspool of 
socialism.  There is truth to this statement.  Socialist politicians tend 
to punish those who help themselves, all for the public good of course.

Funny you should mention this.  A few folks have this very intention. :-)

I'm not following the wording of this last question.  Could you clarify?

That's exactly the point.  And that, I believe, is why the Supreme Court --
or any court for that matter -- will not go near this issue.  It is the
pivotal point that would collapse the whole house of cards that is the
Income Tax.  The feds have a huge vested interest in keeping the system
going as long as they can (Y2K bugs and all) and this issue is a
veritable hornets' nest.
