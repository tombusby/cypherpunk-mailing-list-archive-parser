Just add an anti-spam segment to your email address.

example:

jsmith[at]foo.com

Most people worth talking to have enough of a clue to replace [at] with @.

if your software requires an apparently valid email address, try

jsmith@NOSPAM.foo.com

I put a spam-busted address in my .sig and give root@127.0.0.1 as my email
in the from: header. Sure, somebody out there is going to be unhappy with
me, but if they have a clue they'll figure it out. Meantime, the SpamBots
are bouncing mail to the admin of the site instead of to me.

That may not be enough if you're already in the spamming lists. Try
using 'positive' filtering- instead of filtering to eliminate unwanted
mail, filter email from regular correspondents into a 'approved'
directory, and leave the rest in the inbox to pick through later.

It seems very strange that the denziens of this list, reputed to be gutsy
enough to take on the FBI, NSA, CIA, and White House, would be scared
away from a discussion forum (Usenet) by uninvited email.

We'd better hope they never figure out Cypherpunks, Guardians of
Privacy and Defenders of Free Speech, are afraid of spam.

(And supposedly the 'Moderation experiment' is over, so this won't get
kicked onto the -flames list, although it's more ridicule than flame...)
