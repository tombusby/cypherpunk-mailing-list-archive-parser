  Thank you for your harrassment of the victims of your harrassment
on my behalf.

  So it is a good thing to harrass people who do this? Thanks,
I'll remember that.

  I am certain that you tell them what the federal government and 
military think they need to hear an are well received.

  But you would never do that again, right?

  Nope. Afraid I like to check facts for myself.

  I looked too, but didn't find it.

  I couldn't confirm this myself. Looked like pretty normal files 
to me.

  And to think that a short time ago, they didn't even exist, 
according to your rants.

  I couldn't find this "room" either. Are you sure this stuff
doesn't exist only on your computer?

  Did you check it out? I did. 
  I saw a lot of art. I didn't see any age discrimination. Maybe
they need to be harrassed.
  Perhaps you could start by harassing the naturalists who have
pictures of their families taken in the buff because they don't
seem to realize that their bodies are vile, disgusting things.
  Then you could harrass those who document the photography of
Lewis Carroll, who took pictures that aren't acceptable to 
present day moralists because our children now live long enough
that we can stunt their sexual growth without dire consequences
for survival of the species.

  But now we should liste to your emotional rants about the whole
subject demands that we harrass people over it? Right.

  Which type? The type of activity where naturalists take pictures
of themselves and their families? The type of activity where those
who celebrate the human physique in their art don't use an artificial
cut-off date to decide when art becomes obscenity?

  No you haven't.

  And this time you're not *wrong* like you were before, right?

  I'll rent the Ryder truck, you buy the fertilizer. We'll only kill
the "guilty," right?
