  How about the fact that you are the director of an organization
that actively sought to sabatoge the civil rights movement by,
among other things, encouraging Martin Luther King to commit
suicide?
Is that close enough to the truth for you?

No they wouldn't you lying, scumbag, Nazi piece of shit.
You are *already* doing these things without *any* type of legal
authority to justify your criminal actions, and will continue
to do so?

Right. You can't find airplanes containing tons of drugs, you can't
keep drugs from being sold on the streets and in schoolyards, you
claim to have a list of all of these *known* pedophiles, but yet
they are all running free, even though you know about them.
This, despite all of the fascist, unconstitutional powers you have
stolen from the citizen's right to freedom and privacy.
Yet you have the fucking nerve to suggest that giving LEA's the
ability to monitor all of our private communications, at will,
is going to stop crime.

Buy a fucking clue, shit for brains.
All of the parts of the Constituion you have trampled underfoot,
claiming you needed this to fight drug dealers, has resulted in
the lowest street prices for heroin in decades.
I'll make you a deal. If you can get the street price of a gram
of cocaine up to $300.00 a gram, using your current fascist,
unconstitutional powers, I'll support you getting the rest of
the citizens' rights under your jackboots.

  No. It will nullify the ability to carry out UN-authorized searches
and seizures of non-criminal communications.

Are the keys to the privacy of every living being on earth going to
be kept on the FBI computer system that was hacked, the CIA computer
system that was hacked, the DOJ computer system that was hacked...?

So that corporations know whether to support your plans for Government
Access to Korporate bungholes, would you please publicize a list of
*which* corporations you have defrauded and brought to financial ruin
by accessing and manipulating their financial data and assets because
you disagree with their actions?
How about a list of the corporations that you plan to do this to in the
future? Oh...never mind. I forgot that today's allies are tomorrow's
enemies, and vice-versa, so I guess that *any* corporation could be
a future target of government attack.

How do you brazen, Nazi cocksuckers find the audacity to announce to
God and everybody that you are fucking over people and nations around
the world by inserting bad mechanical parts into the supply system,
trashing the finances of individuals and companies around the world
that you have a hard-on for (today), that Swinestein has put the vote
on encryption issues that the citizens gave her, into *your* hands,
and then tell the citizens they can expect to be more 'secure' if they
give you dictatorial powers over all of their communications and data?

Who will be in control of access to the whole world's communications
and data?
Will it be the FBI guy who just went to jail for destroying evidence
and perverting justice?
Will it be the DOJ people who ruined the INSLAW corporation in order
to STEAL their software? Or the DOJ people who subverted justice by
defying our elected leaders in Congress during their investigation?

Tell us, Lying Jackoff Fuck Louis J. Freeh...
*Which* of the LEA officials who commit criminal acts and subvert
justice in the US will be in charge of access to the citizen's right
to privacy and freedom from fascist search and seizure.
