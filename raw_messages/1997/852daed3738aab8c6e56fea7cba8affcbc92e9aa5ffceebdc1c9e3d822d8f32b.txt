In your long message I was unable to locate an area in which the New
York Times "got it flat wrong".  If anything, your post was more
alarming than the newspaper article.

What you call "fragility" is properly called "security".  Would you
describe 128-bit keys as more "fragile" than 40-bit keys?  Why is PGP,
Inc. inventing propaganda terms for the authorities?

It is fascinating to me that every example you use does not involve
decrypting transmitted messages.  Yet, that is the feature which is
under discussion.

The demand for the ability to decrypt encrypted messages in the
corporate environment can easily be measured with this test: how many
companies have a policy that requires employees to record all outgoing
mail?

This is a red herring.  Nobody has been talking about regulating
cryptography as a matter of public safety in a serious way.  Why is
PGP, Inc. posing non-threats to justify its actions?  Probably because
its actual, all too obvious, motivations are unpalatable to the
cypherpunks and probably to most of its customers and supporters.

They are not unpalatable to Big Brother, however.

I suggest that in the future we do not meet at the PGP, Inc.
headquarters and that we do not treat this company as a trustworthy
ally.
