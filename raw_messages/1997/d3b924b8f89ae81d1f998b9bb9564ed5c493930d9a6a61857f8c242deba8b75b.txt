  Bullshit. Email is no less secure than other channels on the
InteNet.

The chances of your public key being compromised through email to a 
mailing list are slim.

  Bad idea! It makes it vulnerable to attack by those with access to
your system(s), as well as to attack by outside hackers.

  Be aware that the public-key servers are run by agents of the
federal
government whose goal is to prevent crypto users from avoiding
registering
their keys with coming GAK laws.

  Which is full of lies!

  Please note that the proper procedures for obtaining and using
Crypto Keys are outlined by CypherPunk Notable Newbie of the Year,
A. Hoir, in a series of posts on the CypherPunks mailing list.

  I am including my public key below, within the body of this email,
and it can be verified by checking it against the listing for my
keys on the keyserver at http://www.pgp.com/ .

  Lastly, and most importantly, take the time and effort to verify
for yourself any claims made by those posting to mailing lists, in
general, and using anonymous or misleading personas, in particular.
