NEWS & ANNOUNCEMENTS
MICROSOFT RESPONDS TO JAVA SECURITY ISSUES BY POSTING FIX
Researchers at the University of Washington recently
notified Microsoft and other vendors of several dozen
anomalies in Java virtual machines that could
potentially result in Java applets causing a system
crash and/or loss of data.  Microsoft today announced
the immediate availability of an updated version of the
Microsoft virtual machine for Java that addresses the
issues raised by the University of Washington.

The researchers with the Kimera Project in the
Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the
University of Washington have an automatic validation
technology that allows them to quickly identify
potential bugs in commercial Java implementations.
Their tests uncovered a variety of Java anomalies,
including 17 which affect the Microsoft virtual machine
and 24 which affect Sun Microsystem's virtual machine.

The anomalies are in the bytecode "verifier", which
enforces the security of the Java sandbox. There have
been no known attacks that exploit these anomalies, but
they could potentially allow a malicious application to
get access outside the sandbox.  More information is
available on the University of Washington's Kimera
Project website at
http://www.washington.edu/newsroom/news/k051997.html.

The updated version of the Microsoft virtual machine is
available to all users of Internet Explorer, Internet
Information Server and Visual J++ from
http://www.microsoft.com/java. All users and developers
are encouraged to download the new version of the
virtual machine.  The updated version will also be
distributed with all future releases of Microsoft
products containing the virtual machine.

ANNOUNCING NEW SITE BUILDER NETWORK DISCUSSION GROUPS
Because the Site Builder's Exchange discussion group
has been so busy lately, we've decided to divide it into
focused discussion groups. The Site Builder Network
Forum offers ongoing discussions on following topics:
Internet Explorer/HTML, Java/Visual J++, Active Server
Pages and Web and Graphic Design. Check out this cool
members-only benefit provided by The Cobb Group
accessible through the Level 1 lounge. Not a member?
It's time to sign up!

SITE BUILDER WORKSHOP ADDS DYNAMIC HTML AREA
Site Builder Workshop has added a whole new section just
for information on Dynamic HTML at
http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/.  This
powerful new technology in Internet Explorer unchains
HTML authors--and their Web pages--and makes interactive
components easy to build.  Microsoft's Dynamic HTML
technology gives authors creative control so they can
manipulate any page element and change styles,
positioning, and content at any time -- not only when
the page is loaded.
