Interesting interpretation.  Mind you, I'm obliged to disagree.

My understanding was that the moderator is supposed to ONLY
filter out ads and utterly-content-free messages.  (Mind you,
I took the smart out and subbed to cp-unedited, so I'm in
no place to judge.)  If the idea was to place control in the
hands of someone who rarely posts, why not give it to me?
There are probably a few hundred of the real addresses on this
list (not the mail-echoers) that have never posted.

Aha, a good point to be brought up: Sandy, are you autofiltering
anyone based on user name, or on certain keywords? Seems to
defeat the purpose of having a _human_ moderator.
