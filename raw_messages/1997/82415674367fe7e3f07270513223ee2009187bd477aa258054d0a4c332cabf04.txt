HOW IS YOUR BREATH?
=======================
-->  Do you shy away from meeting people because of your breath?
-->  Do you experience isolation and a diminished quality of life?
-->  Does bad breath still persist even after you've tried every known
      breath spray, breath mint, mouthwash or internal capsule on the
      market?

Bad breath is no joke to those who have it.  In fact, it can be a source 
of EMBARRASSMENT and SHAME.

=================
THE GOOD NEWS
=================
Doctors and Dentists used to believe the source of bad breath 
was the digestive system.  Research has shown this is 
SIMPLY NOT TRUE!

Actually, the good news about bad breath is that -- in 9 out of 10
cases -- it originates in the mouth, and this type of bad breath
is CURABLE!

THE PERFECT SOLUTION!!!
