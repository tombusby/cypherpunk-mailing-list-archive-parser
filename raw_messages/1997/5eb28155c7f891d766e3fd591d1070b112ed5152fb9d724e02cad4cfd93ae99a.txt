I reproduced the message in my message earlier tonight. Although there are
no headers to show routing, since I sent it but never received it, I can
assure you it was marked by Eudora as "Sent," and my ISP has reported no
delivery problems of any sort. Thus, based on past experiences with
thousands of such sendings, I surmise with great certainty that my message
was mailed successfully to cypherpunks@toad.com. What happened to if after
that I cannot say, but I suspect something related to the "Moderation"
process, by Ockham's Razor.

There seem to be more "lost" messages than before this "Moderation" thing
began. I literally sent thousands of messages (maybe tens of thousands...)
and cannot recall a "lost" message. Now, it's happened to me a couple of
times that I can recall, and to at least some others, based on recent
messages.

I thought the basic equation was:

UNEDITED = MAIN + FLAMES,  with MAIN and FLAMES being disjoint.

It's looking now more like:

UNEDITED = MAIN + FLAMES +  DROPPED/LOST

Possibly the fault lies in the software Sandy is using to sort the
messages, possibly elsewhere. Whatever, this needs to be fixed immediately,
or the experiment abandoned immediately.
