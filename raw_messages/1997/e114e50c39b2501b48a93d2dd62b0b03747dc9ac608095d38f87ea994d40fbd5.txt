Assuming developers and users of "alternative" systems (including 
Unix family) are concerned about how MS is consolidating its 
position as the complete manager of the business/academic affairs of 
the entire globe,  I suggest to the members of the free Unix groups 
(developers, administrators/superusers) that they develop their own 
turnkey "office suite" and try to give MS a run for its money.  There 
is no time like now to get the X-Windows (or GUI-free-from-copyright) 
Complete Office bundled together and have a media gathering to make 
sure that all the important news organizations are informed.  You 
should get decent press exposure, since MS-bashing seems to be in 
vogue.  The Linux or FreeBSD people should select a mediagenic 
spokesperson from the group--one with fire in the belly--and then do 
the hard work of putting something together that a 25-year old 
free-Unix developer's 72-year old grandmother can install to a x86 
box.  In fact, your press conference would have real pinache if, in 
fact, you put someone's 72-year old grandmother before a PC with an 
empty disk drive, run the install, then type a short letter on the 
fancy word processer, addressed to Bill G., with the message "Up 
yours!"

By attacking Bill G. from the flank in this matter, you may possibly 
take his mind off his successful campaign to own the Internet.  I 
admire BillG, really.  He was rather late in anticipating how a 
network developed largely by universities and their students could be 
a medium that intruded upon the everyday world, and yet despite the 
efforts of well-meaning individuals and not-for-profit groups to keep 
the Internet from being owned, Bill G. just has too much savvy not to 
be able to own the important parts of the Internet too--not the 
cables and wires, of course, but the content as well as the software 
that drives it. And soon.  (Look for the next version of TCPIP, if it 
is called that, to be a copyright of Microsoft.  After all, Microsoft 
has its roots in writing OSes.)
