The Rest of the Story:

Terrorist Cow Dump Prompts Congrssional Action!

In a rapid response to terrorist cow dumping reported over the Pacific Ocean,
the United States Congress has passed and sent on to the President for his
signature a law making it illegal to drive cattle from flying aircraft over
any territory of the United States. President Clinton has previously stated
he will sign such a bill sent to him.

|Last Page: Flying cow sinks japanese fishing boat
|
|Wladiwostok. A cow fell out of an airplane before the siberian coast
|and smashed onto japanese fishing boat, causing it to sink. That
|reported the German Embassy in Moscow in an internal note to the
|[german] State Department.
|
|Appearantly a russian military plane was flying over the Ochotskian
|sea with stolen cows on board; the cows started panicking and made
|the airplane instable in it's flight - they weren't tied to the
|walls. Therefore the pilots used the last possibility: they opened
|the back door and moved the cows out of the machine. One of the cows
|hit a japanese fishing boat and turned it over. The crew could save
|themselves to the coast, where they were arrested by russian guards,
|who wouldn't believe the cow story - until an investigation proved
|it valid.
|
|A russian official responsible for traffic is supposed to have
|mentioned this case to the German Embassy as a strange example for
|the terrible condition of russian flight safety. The State
|Department would neither confirm nor deny the incident.
