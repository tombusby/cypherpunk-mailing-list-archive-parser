>Mitsubishi Electric Corp. said it has developed a software program which
>can be used to evaluate the security of various symmetric-key encryption
>algorithms, where the sender and recipient share the same key. 
>
>The program analyzes a given encryption technology and displays the amount
>of computing power required to deduce the key and decrypt the message. 
>
>Secure and practical data encryption is a necessary technology for the
>popularization of electronic money and electronic commerce. Mitsubishi's
>program could end up becoming an index by which to objectively evaluate the
>many new symmetric-key encryption methods being developed. 
>
>The software combines the differential decryption method developed by
>Israeli encryption expert Adi Shamir with Mitsubishi's proprietary linear
>decryption method. By attempting to deduce the key with simple
>approximations of the encryption algorithm, the program determines the
>minimal volume of computations needed to crack the code, and also shows how
>long the key should be in order to make decryption nearly impossible. 

>Mitsubishi said it has also finished development of a software program
>which uncovers the key based on the pattern of random numbers generated in
>the course of encrypting a message. 

>The next step for the company is to combine all three decryption methods
>into a comprehensive program for evaluation. Working with support from the
>Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the company hopes to finish
>and publicize its program by next spring, providing it free of charge to
>users. (More)
