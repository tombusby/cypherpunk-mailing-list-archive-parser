Dear Colleagues:

      With this note, I am making several important announcements. First,
the University of Louisville is currently accepting nominations for the 11th
annual Grawemeyer Award in Ideas Improving World Order. Administered by the
Department of Political Science, this award carries a cash prize of one-
hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000). Nominations for the 1998
competition must be received by October 31, 1997. The submission process is
relatively simple, nominators must complete a one page form and a nomination
letter. Self-nomination is permitted.

      Second, please also make note of the world wide web home page for the
Grawemeyer World Order Award. This location hosts some material about the
nomination and selection processes and a list of past winners and their prize
winning work. Additional information is added periodically. The address for
the web page is:

      http://www.louisville.edu/ur/onpi/grawemeyer

      Third, I will be attending the APSA meetings next week in Washington
and would be happy to meet with prospective nominees or nominators--or
those curious about the award. You might want to contact me in advance.
Please note that I will not be available on Thursday the 28th. I plan to
distribute copies of our new brochure to relevant publishers and I will
try to place additional copies in a prominent spot.

      For further information, feel free to contact me by e-mail at:
rapayn01@ulkyvm.louisville.edu; by telephone at (502) 852-3316; by fax at
(502) 852-7923; or by writing in care of the Department of Political Science,
University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, 40292.

      Alternatively, those interested might wish to contact Ms. Arlene
Brannon, who assists in the administration of the award. Her telephone number
is (502) 852-1009, her e-mail address is aabran01@ulkyvm.louisville.edu; and
she can be reached at the Departmental address and fax number listed above.

                                          Sincerely,

                                          Rodger A. Payne, Ph.D.
                                          Director
                                          Grawemeyer Award for
                                           Ideas Improving World Order

P.S. I apologize to those who receive duplicate copies of this mailing.
