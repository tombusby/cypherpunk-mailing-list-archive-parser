The NIST IPsec-WIT (Web-based Interoperability Tester) is on-line
and ready for use.

IPsec-WIT is an interoperability test system built around the NIST Cerberus
IPsec reference implementation and commonly available WWW technology.
IPsec-WIT allows its users to remotely control and execute series of
interoperability tests with the Cerberus prototype.  Test case selection,
configuration, execution and results analysis are all controlled remotely
by WWW browser.  IPsec-WIT is currently operational for IPv4 IPsec protocols
(with over 60 test cases) and will soon support IPv6 as well as key management
protocol testing.

For access to IPsec-wit and additional information see:
http://ipsec-wit.antd.nist.gov.  It is recommended that you read through
the tutorial before testing for the first time.  Comments and recommendations
can be sent to ipsec-wit-dev@mail.antd.nist.gov.

Best Regards,

PS - Sorry if you have already seen this once.  I sent it out yesterday
