I don't know if this will help you, but, I have found that by typing win
winmine.exe at the dos prompt, I am taken straight to minesweeper.  The
program manager window is minimized in this example.
It seems that most of windows programs, when accessed from File/Run act like
command line programs, this is how the File Manager can bring up a text file
in the Write program.  I haven't tried it, but you might try nesting
arguments, for instance WIN WRITE FILE.TXT to see if it comes right up into
Write, working on file.txt.  I will have to get back to you on rather or not
this works, but if it does, and someone has cracked the windows macro
Recorder, such as what you described should be possible from a batch file.
