So you're saying that the system would work.  Mr. bell would be targeted, a
price on his head, for starting that very system.  Mr. Bell would be a
martyr, his system being proven by his own death.  It would be some varient
of his idea that would be used to kill him, a bounty.
I think that the system would work, I also think that it would be easiest to
use by those already in possession of the money.
It would take care of part of our overpopulation problem though...
