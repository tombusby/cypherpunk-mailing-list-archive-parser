The keyservers using pgp2.x as the key lookup engine are struggling
because the database code isn't very good.  But the experimental MIT
keyserver, and Tage Stabell-Kulo's key server code on the key server
in Norway fairly whistle through key lookups.  PGP Inc also is using
the better keysever code -- I think based on the one at MIT
implemented by Marc (surname escapes me right now).

It all depends on how up to date you are on keyserver performance
problems; perhaps you are more up to date than myself, perhaps not.

The answer I think which must come in any case is a distributed key
server system because the current 100% replication method seems
unlikely to scale to likely future demands, with or without forward
secrecy.  If your company holds keys for it's employees on it's openly
accessible key server, this distribution will be very similar to DNS,
and similarly scalable.

I think this is taking it too far.  Have you considered how much
traffic DNS handles right now?  I would have thought it would be many
orders of magnitude more than forward secret email is going to cause.
Web traffic is the bulk of network communications, just imagine the
DNS lookups caused by 50 million netters clicking away. 

Bear in mind also hear that most users will probably be entirely
satisfied with a communications key update time of 1 week.  It is
probably mostly cypherpunks, or people with high value communications
to secure who would opt for more frequent key updates.

Bear in mind also that once the new key has been issued, you could
also release a deletion request for the previous one on the keyserver
in the form of a revocation certificate.

Nothing.  It is unaffected.  The WoT is only based on signature keys.
You personally certify your communication with your signature key.

> Exactly how much added security is provided by all of this?? 

Lots.  Consider: you are the average PGP user, you have one key
generated per year if you are lucky (probably more like once per life
time).  You are in a company, and the company has a heck of a time
persuading people not to use dumb passwords, or leave their passwords
on yellow sticky notes conveniently stuck to the corner of the
screen.

Scenario: the cleaner is bribed to switch on a machine with a supplied
boot floppy to put in the drive, and writes down the password on the
sticky note.

So, without forward secrecy the attacker now has all the traffic said
PGP user wrote in the life time of his encryption key.  What's that 1
years traffic?  (He'll have collected the ciphertext by eavesdropping
on SMTP traffic travelling over the internet).

With say once-a-day forward secrecy, the attacker gets nothing, no
previous communications, and no future communications.

Granted the attacker can install a replacement version of PGP to try
to get future traffic, but the company can run automated audit checks
of varying sophistications each morning to check if machines have been
switched on, and if files have been altered.  If tampering is
detected, or perhaps every morning you re-install the machine from
scratch remotely, as the MIT project did.  (Reckoned to be a human
resource efficient method of running networks -- got a problem with
your machine -- reload it, the lot no arguments).

Forward secrecy in a way is not something you need to argue about
adding or not as such, because in a sense you've already got it, built
in to pgp5.0.

To see what I mean you'd need to read Hal Finney's recent post on the
OpenPGP list, where he described how you could already achieve forward
secrecy using the fact that you've got a separate encryption key and
signature key.

You just set the encryption key to have a short expiry, and generate a
new one when it does expire.  You sign the encryption keys with your
signature key to transfer the WoT based trust to them.


The only extra functionality I am arguing for over what PGP5.0 already
has is some built in support for this type of usage, so that pgp will
manage the generation of new keys at the key expiry point
transparently.  That much as such doesn't need any modifications to
the current PGP standard.  It's an implementation issue.  Another
vendor could easily already implement this type of functionality.

Also I'm arguing for separate communications and storage keys, I think
this is almost essential once PGP starts to work with escrow schemes,
because there are similar arguments for separating storage and
communications keys as there were for creating separate signature and
encryption keys from the original single key.

Actually I hear Fred Piper was semi-seriously arguing for this ... his
argument went like this: mass storage is cheap and getting cheaper
fast; often the communications needed could be covered for years worth
of comms between to organisations by exchanged of a small read only
storage device.  Simple, and fool proof, etc.  But I digress.

I know, convenient for implementing this type of feature.


I was also arguing for support for once per message forward secrecy.
You should like that one because I was arguing that this should be
done with out keyservers.  Just send the key to the person your
communicating in the email you would like a forward secret reply to.

I also personally prefer people to send me keys in email, because the
pay per second phone lines here at home mean that I tend want to avoid
doing too many online key lookups, so I think this would be an
individually useful feature.
