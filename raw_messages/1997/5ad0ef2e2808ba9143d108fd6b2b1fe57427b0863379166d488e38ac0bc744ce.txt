 <><><>  Attention Internet Marketers ... Look no further.  <><><>

 30 (thirty) MILLION PLUS E-MAIL ADDRESSES - ONLY US$149!


(Please Note: Introductory offer - we encourage you to act soon.)


WorldWide Marketing Group is pleased to finally offer to the direct marketer,
the culmination of its intensive 6 month long project in compiling the single
largest e-mail address list available anywhere - over 30 million e-mail
addresses free of duplicates, one per line and alphabetically sorted - for
only US$149! This is for real... there is NO catch!

This massive list of AOL, Compuserve, Prodigy, Genie, Delphi, Microsoft
Network and general Internet addresses, is split into 120 easily manageable
ZIP files (unzip utilities included on CD) of 250,000 addresses each and is 
delivered to you on CD-ROM via regular mail. Sorry, but the sheer size of this
list makes it unfeasible to deliver via diskette or allow downloading via FTP.

The address files themselves consist of 1 address per line and are in 
standard ASCII text format - ready right away for use with any of the 
popular bulk e-mail packages available today.

Also, this list is CLEAN! There are NO duplicates, NO embedded spaces, NO
trailing or embedded white noise characters, NO garbage addresses with more
than one '@' character, NO embedded parentheses '(' or ')', NO 'Postmaster'
addresses, NO addresses beginning with non-valid characters (..addresses must 
begin with 0-9 or a-z), and all are in lower-case.

The list itself is *not* categorized or targeted by any geographic 
region or demographic in any way. It is simply a HUGE general list 
sorted in alphabetical order for the best price on the internet!

Indeed, this is absolutely the *best* offer around for the direct marketer,
and will finally put the little guy on even ground with even the biggest
bulk e-mailers!

Bulk e-mail is still in its infancy and is the new wave in cost-effective
global marketing. This huge list offers a whole world of vast potential sales
for you and your products - get on board now before you find yourself left
behind. We wish you success and we'll see you at the top!
