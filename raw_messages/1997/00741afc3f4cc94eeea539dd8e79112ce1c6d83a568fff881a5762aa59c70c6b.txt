I received this code from another friend.

Here's a FAST somewhat cryptographically secure pseudo-random generator
written by a friend of mine that wishes to remain anonymous.  He has given
permission for the following code to be placed in the public domain, and to
be sent to cypherpunks and others for review.  Alas, I have never gotten
around to doing so.  As it states, on a PowerPC it'll produce bits fast
enough to be a pseudo-one-time pad / stream cipher for good digitized video
on a LAN (the purpose for which he originally sent it to me) and hence
should do point-to-point audio without even breathing hard.

For those who haven't heard, the scenario is for point-to-point audio to
use an affordable (weak) stream cipher, but to be changing keys frequently
using our strongly secure SSL channel.  Each costly break would only
compromise a few seconds or so of audio.  The following code may serve as
the affordable (but maybe better than weak) stream cipher.

// Low-order bits in the following act as an xor-based linear feedback
shift register (with moving taps
// and stationary data); the repeat period equals (1 << 31) - 1.
Higher-order bits have similar
// "intrinsic" behavior, but the state of each is determined by additional
xoring with a sequence
// of carry bits from below, causing repeated period-doubling across the
width of the word.
//
//    The choice of 31 and 13 corresponds to a primitive polynomial mod 2;
Applied Cryptography has
// typos in polynomial coefficients, but the repeat period was tested
directly. This code avoids a
// shift-direction mistake in Applied Cryptography, and hence follows
Numerical Recipes.
