That was what I recollected, vaguely.

I haven't spent near as much time analyzing Pro-CODE as I did a couple of
weeks ago with SAFE. People tell me Pro-CODE is not nearly as bad, but I
remain skeptical. And certainly James Donald is basically right that _any_
provision for a "review board" is a disaster.

Review boards mean bureaucracy, entrenched interests, and a wedge for
denial of licensens.

As to Conrad Burns himself, he seemd jovial and "conservative" at last
summer's Stanford mini-conference. Conservative in the sense I like.

But how will a Montana Republican like him respond when ultra-strong crypto
is used to, say, import child porn undetectably from Denmark, where there
standards of what is child porn differ from those of Montana? This is where
the "Review Board" will get involved, and so on and so forth.

No politician I know of will ever be a friend of crypto anarchy.
