  I set up a "spoof" of the anonymizer page where it says "Click here
to find out what we know about you." <paraphrased) and turned a friend
on to the URL. When she clicked on the link, it provided all of the
relevant computer info, as well as her home address, the color of her
favorite nightie, and the fact that she sleeps with her bedroom window
open.
  She was only fooled for a fraction of a second, but in that time she
wet her drawers.

  I have no doubt that at some point in the future she will be able to
click on a similar link which is *not* a spoof.
