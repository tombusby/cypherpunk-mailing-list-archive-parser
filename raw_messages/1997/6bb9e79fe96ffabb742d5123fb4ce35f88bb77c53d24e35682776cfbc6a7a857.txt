You will if you mark the key with this information.

This is the same approach PGP is already using to provide the GAK
compliant implementation of corporate access to stored emails.

I'm not arguing.  Of course they do.

What I _am_ arguing is that in designing systems to provide companies
with data recovery mechanisms that you should a) not weaken security
more than necessary, and b) that it would be nice if you used a method
which doesn't introduce GAK compliancy for communications keys.

I presented I think in plenty of detail an alternate mechanism which
is both non-GAK compliant, and more secure.  So what is the problem?
Is there a technical flaw in my solution?

Agreed 100%.  This is why I went to great pains to demonstrate
precisely how you could achieve recovery of stored messages in a more
secure and non-GAK compliant way.

my proposed mechanism for stored email recovery copes with all that.

Agreed.  You can flag backdoors with either solution.

It works well enough, but it could be made much more secure, by
separating storage key functionality from transient message key
functionality.  This would also give you the chance to resolve the
articificially created need for GAK compliancy, which arises because
you are being forced by this lack of distinction between key
functionalities to use one key for both long term storage and what
should be transient communications key usage.

If that is PGP's aim, they failed most miserably.

Decentralised control is good, of course, but the pgp5.5 and SMTP
policy enforcer is a ready to roll GAK system.  

The visibility principle is good but is an entirely separable issue.

Yes, it is better than a government arranged "key recovery" key
infrastructure.

If the OpenPGP standard is to include the GAK compliancy features, and
these competing systems use this standard, as long as the sum of the
OpenPGP compliant systems gets to 80% (or whatever) it doesn't matter
whether this is mostly provided by PGP, or mostly by GAK sellout
companies like IBM, or TIS.  It is a dangerous development to have a
largely fielded compatible set of GAK compliant products, whoever the
providers are.

Email encryption needs to be standardised, otherwise people can't talk
to each other.  This suggests to me that one standard _will_ evolve as
the winner, or if there are other standards, they will be backwards
compatible to this main standard.  A very related example of this kind
of principle in action is the fact that most secured web traffic is
secured by Netscape's SSL.

The French Government used require licenses for crypto, which were
hard to come by, and crypto without licenses was illegal.  In that
framework you couldn't see them liking PGP period.

More recently they have been swaying towards allowing crypto without
licenses, but only if it is GAK compliant.  PGP 5.5 & SMTP policy
enforcer should be a sell out.  Maybe y'all should pitch it to the
French government and SCSII (their NSA).

That's simple: you already have the mechanism, just put one of those
attributes Jon described on the key stating this fact.

Glad to hear it.  Can we take it from that that PGP won't be arguing
for the GAK compliancy flag Jon Callas described to be part of the
standard then?  This is needed for said non "message recovery" base
client product to also be OpenPGP compliant.

CMR keys and the way that PGP has designed their associated flags and
the SMTP policy enforcer app are what make PGP GAK compliant.  

Also there are clear security advantages to _never_ send
communications encrypted to two keys.  There are clear security
advantages to separating the functionality of storage and
communications keys.  Communications keys are the most sensitive of
all, and should have the shortest life times.  In some applications
this could be minutes.

The PGP bashing PGP observes is an attempt by the pro-privacy crypto
community to influence PGP to re-think the GAK compliancy, and to
point out the more secure way to implement corporate recovery of
stored email messages without GAK compliancy.

I reserve the right to bash any company which attempts to field GAK
compliant software.

If PGP wants to make an additional stance against GAK here are my
recommendations:

1. remove GAK compliancy fields
2. scrap SMTP GAK compliancy policy enforcer app
3. separate storage and communications keys 
4. use shorter lived communications keys giving forward secrecy
5. implement corporate recovery of stored mail folders with escrowed
   storage keys

Forward secrecy is _the_ strongest statement you could possibly make
against GAK.
