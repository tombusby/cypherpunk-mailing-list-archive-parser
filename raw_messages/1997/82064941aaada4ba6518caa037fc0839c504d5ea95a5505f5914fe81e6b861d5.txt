I was unable to connect to the listed URL, but I rather suspect this is not
a form of "e-cash" that is of much interest or use to Cypherpunks.

No mention of "untraceable" or "anonymous" or "Chaum." And no mention of
"Digicash," except in your (Wayne's) introduction; Digicash is, rightly or
wrongly, a trademark of the company with the same name.
