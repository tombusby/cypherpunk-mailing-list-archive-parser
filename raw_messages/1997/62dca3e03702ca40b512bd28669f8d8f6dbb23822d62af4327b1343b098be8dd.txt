  In light of the great amount of discussion currently taking
place in regard to the benefits and disadvantages of my latest
bid for money, power, fame and the respect of the corporate
computer industry, I would like to reassure the cynics that
my committment to privacy has never been stronger.
  However, I have reassessed my views of who truly has a right
to control access to privacy and have come to the conclusion
that privacy is too important an issue to be left in the hands
of the individual, with the obvious potential for misuse.
  After a review of the astounding success of the PGP Public Key
Server's use, in conjunction with our PGP Privy Products, in
ensuring proper key management and control of forgery, spoofing
and misuse of Public/Private Key technology, it has become clear
that individual privacy can best be ensured under the watchful
eye of those with the resources to provide proper surveillance
of those who have earned the right to privacy, in order to 
prevent abuse of that right.

  I would like to thank my other brother, Phil (Hallam-Baker),
for helping me to see that unsupervised use of the right to
privacy could result in individuals misusing that right to
publish extremely embarassing pictures of me in compromising
positions which could affect my credibility.
  As a matter of fact, it was PH-B who suggested my new
signature line.
