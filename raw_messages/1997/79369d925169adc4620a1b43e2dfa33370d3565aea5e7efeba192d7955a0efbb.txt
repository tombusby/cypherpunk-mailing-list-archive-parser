I think that with the demise of Mr Bell and anyone running
a remailer there would be an end to his scheme pretty quickly.

Society is not bound to put up with cranks and psychopaths.
there is no right to anonymously call for murder. The authorities
could easily stop Bells scheme.

The point I was making is that it is not consistent as claimed.
