This, as I pointed out long ago, is why I didn't think a "crack the DES key" 
contest is necessarily a good idea, at least if it's ordinary 
Von-Neumann-type computers doing the searching.  It makes DES look 
artificially good.

Assuming it's possible to build a chip which tests solutions in a 
massively-pipelined mode, the 400,000 or so solutions per second tried (for 
what is probably a $2000 machine) would probably increase to 100 million per 
second per chip (at a cost of maybe $100 per chip, if implemented in 
parallel).    That's 5000 times more economical,  which would translate to a 
find in 2-3 days if the same dollars in hardware were invested.

_THAT_ is the break we should hope the media publicizes, not the one that 
will eventually happen when accomplished by PCs or Suns, etc.
