Something that I have found irritating about the posts by
non-persistent identities is that it isn't possible to support a
meaningful discussion as previous statements can always be repudiated,
or maybe even weren't made by the particular poster.  I compared this
to sound bites.

On second thought, however, there is an easy way to solve this.  If
the anonymous poster accepts the context of previous messages, the
discussion can continue.  There's no reason why the person behind the
virtual thread has to be the same, but the context itself is important
if we want to have interesting discussions.

So, if you don't want to sign your messages, just acknowledge the
message ID of the relevant previous messages whose context you wish to
use.
