The January Bay Area Cypherpunks meeting will be on January 17th,
rather than the normal second Saturday, to accommodate the RSA conference
and W3C conference that will be in town that week.

The agenda is not set, but will include
- Export law presentation by Lee Tien, Greg Broiles, and maybe Cindy Cohn
- Secure DNS export
- Latest PGP / McAfee / Network Associates merger and related discussion
- More topics appreciated

Location will probably be PGP headquarters in San Mateo, but may
be another convenient Bay Area location.

A more detailed announcement will follow.

				Thanks!
