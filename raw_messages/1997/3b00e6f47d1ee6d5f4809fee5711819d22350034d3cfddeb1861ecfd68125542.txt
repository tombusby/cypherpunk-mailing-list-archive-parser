Exactly! By jove you got it! By demanding your liberty but demanding
that 'we' go to Singapore or anywhere else and treat them as chattels
we have clearly instituted a double-standard. Most parties in this
discussion still haven't made that distinction.

All we have done is replace their current tyrant with a new one, mainly 
us.

Exactly. And by applying pressure on Singapore we only help them keep
that tyrany in place. The quickest way I know to make a social institution
band together is self-preservation from an outside threat, real or
perceived.

ALL social orders are corrupt. The 3 laws of thermodynamics apply to
everything including social institutions.

1. You can't get ahead
2. You can't break even
3. You can't quit the game
