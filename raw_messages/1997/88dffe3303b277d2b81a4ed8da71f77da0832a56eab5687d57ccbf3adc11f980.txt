   Do the words 'Gun Control' ring a bell?
   It seems that every time government announces its intention to
restrict 'criminals' use of an item, it is not long before everyone
using that item is considered a criminal.
 
  In the case of encryption, it will still be legal, but not if 
you use real bullets.
  Perhaps if enough people manage to circumvent forced key escrow
in the future, the government will pass a law requiring all crypto
products to force everybody to use the same password. (I can hardly
wait to see what reasoning they use to explain to us that it is for
our own protection.)
