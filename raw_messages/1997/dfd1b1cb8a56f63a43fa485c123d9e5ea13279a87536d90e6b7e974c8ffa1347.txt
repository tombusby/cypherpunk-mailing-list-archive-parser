Welcome to the list-managers mailing list!

Please save this message for future reference.  Thank you.

If you ever want to remove yourself from this mailing list,
you can send mail to <Majordomo@GreatCircle.COM> with the following
command in the body of your email message:

    unsubscribe list-managers EALLENSMITH@mbcl.rutgers.edu

 Here's the general information for the list you've subscribed to,
 in case you don't already have it:

Description
===========
This list is for discussions of issues related to managing Internet
mailing lists, including (but not limited to) methods, mechanisms,
techniques, policies, and software (in general; questions about
specific software packages should be directed to the mailing list
dedicated to that particular package).

Technical questions regarding particular software packages (for
instance, Majordomo, LISTPROC, ListServ, etc.) are NOT appropriate
for the List-Managers mailing list.  They should be directed to the
mailing list dedicated to that particular package (for instance,
for Majordomo, that's Majordomo-Users@GreatCircle.COM).  Check the
documentation that came with the package to find out where the support
list for that package is hosted.

This list is an outgrowth of the "Mailing Lists" workshop session
at the USENIX System Administration Conference (LISA VI) in Long
Beach, CA, on October 22, 1992.

This is the undigestified version of the list.  All messages sent to this
list are immediately forwarded to members of the list.  The digestified
version of the list is List-Managers-Digest@GreatCircle.COM.

Policies
========
You can subscribe a local redistribution list or a gateway to a local
newsgroup, as long as whatever you do is local to your site.  This
restriction makes it much easier for me to track down mailer problems.

I'm very aggressive when it comes to bounced email.  If email to you
starts bouncing, I'll probably drop you from the list fairly quickly;
you'll have to resubscribe when you get the problem fixed, and retrieve
the archives to find out what you missed.

Archives
========
All messages to the list are archived.  The archives are available via
Majordomo using the "get" command (send "help" in the body of a message
to "Majordomo@GreatCircle.COM" for more info), or via anonymous FTP from
host FTP.GreatCircle.COM in directory "pub/list-managers/archive".  The
archives are broken down by year and month, and are stored in files named
"list-managers.YYMM".  The copy of the archive available by anonymous FTP
is updated every night at 2am local time (0900 GMT in the summer, 1000
GMT in the winter).
