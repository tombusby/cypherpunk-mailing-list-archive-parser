	That may be what they *SAY*, based on what they *DO*, what they 
are for is taking from the productive members of society, and giving to 
the unproductive. (or rather taking from the financially productive, and
giving to the financially unproductive.).

	Liberals usually don't think much. They are too busy "feeling" and
playing with their crystals.

	Really? I wasn't aware that the Kennedys were/are targets of public
and private abuses. Nor are the Clintons (exepct they are from Arkansas), 
nor most _current_ union members, including their leadership. etc.

	We got plenty of nukes, and if we feel those are too dirty (I don't 
think one or two would matter, but any more than that and things might get 
a little nasty) we could always descalate (or whatever the opposite of 
escalate is) to small arms or conventional explosives. 

> 	Corollary 2: Repeated Libertarian rantings won't solve it either.

	No, but it might get one or two people to stop fingering their 
crystals/genitals long enough to realize that big monololitihc governments 
do not now and never have provided protection for the individual. The 
protections of individuals, whether that be civil-liberty type protections, 
or protections against other evils is always more effective the closer it gets
to home. When neighbors work together, theives have a real hard time.
(the only time when Big Government tends to protect one better than the 
city/neighborhood is in times of war, but if there weren't any big governments,
there wouldn't be any big wars...).
