This is a good start.  You would do well to keep your wild claims to a
minimum until after the first cursory reviews.

DES 128 - no such beast
PGP 1024 - this is presumably a RSA key size, and has nothing
to do with the session key involved in actually encrypting the data
RSA 128 - RSA is not suited to encrypting streams of data but if
you wanted to use it for that purpose 128bits would be ridiculusly
to small to be secure
IDEA 128 - wow, you've actually named one real block cipher!
IMDMP 2048 - feh

The fact that you would consider this to be a sufficient test is proof enough
for me that you should not be designing cryptosystems.

Not even close.
