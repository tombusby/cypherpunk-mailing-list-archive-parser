Wheee, check this out... there's thing called a Download Wizard that
"offers suggested updates" for software on your hard drive... Now buys and
girls, can we guess what else it will do? i.e. give to Microsoft a list
of? Hrrmmm?

As it says on the page you refer to:

The Download Wizard will now check your computer for exisiting Microsoft
software files and make suggestions for file updates that may be
appropriate for your computer's configuration. The Download Wizard will
NOT automatically change, add, or delete any files on your computer. You
will be given the choice to download and install each of these files
yourself. Important: Before downloading any files, be sure to check with
your system administrator. 

I.e., we make it easy to find out if there are updates that _may_ apply
to you (and screen out lots that for sure _don't_) -- you still have to
decide if you want them.

The backend for this is pretty heavyweight and labor intensive -- it's
not ready to be a product.

ZAW is the product that is supposed to support automation of admin of
workstation and servers in a corporate environment.
