  Look on the bright side. At least your old 286 will finally be 
worth some money when CompuServe and AOL decide to dump those
'fast' machines that are hurting their profit margin.

  Any good rancher knows that in order to herd the cattle and the 
sheep, you have to get them moving first. And once they get used to
being herded into the 'feedlot', they stop paying attention and 
fail to notice when the 'feedlot' they get herded into happens to
be located conveniently next to a rendering plant.

  Must be just a 'coincidence' that they are 'herding' all information
toward an entity spawned by the DOD and other government security
organizations--the "government 'behind' the government."

  Of course, the Universities' own communications will no doubt be fully
protected with Key Escrow Encryption.

  I think that this statement shows a strong need for the academics and
intellectuals to discuss this issue, perhaps even write a 'paper' on it,
after giving it several years of close study, naturally.
  I, for one, would be more than willing to help them smuggle the
results
of their study out of the forced labor camp they find themselves in by
the time it is completed.

  Thanks for a thoughtful and insightful post on these issues. I am sure
that they will be seriously considered in a wide Circle of people who
are
not just composed of smart alecs with blanc minds.
