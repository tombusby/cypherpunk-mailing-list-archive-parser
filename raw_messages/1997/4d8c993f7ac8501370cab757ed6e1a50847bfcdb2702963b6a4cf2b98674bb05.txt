But that's *precisely* what I set out to avoid. The intention is to eliminate
the multiple-recipient encryption which is the real problem with PGP 5.5's
CMR. The NSA can easily put themselves at the top of the encryption hierachy,
but then all mail will *only* be encrypted to the NSA, and the recipient
will not be able to read it. Rather than encrypting to multiple recipients,
you would encrypt to a single key which is available to all those recipients.

Exactly. Or the individual sales-people create personal 'corporate use
keys' and escrow them, or the key is retained in a secure 'black box' which
takes incoming email encrypted to the sales department and outputs plaintext.
The point is that mail sent to that key can be recovered somehow, but 
confidential mail sent to their private, personal key cannot.

I agree. But that can be solved in some fashion; the 'black box' approach,
for example.

Sure, but better than a security nightmare *and* GAK.

Yep, that was one of the options I listed; the 'black box' above.

But this is the one thing they don't seem to have a business case for. In
my system, if the mail was encrypted to that recipient's personal key rather
than a group key or an individual escrowed key, then the sender had a good reason to do so. In that case, the only reason a company could want to read 
the mail is for snooping on their employees. I don't believe that PGP or 
anyone else should be encouraging that.

The proxy key stuff seemed interesting, but not something that can be
implemented in the next few months. I'm thinking of this as a short-term
solution, not long-term.
