     E-Transaction Lab for Financial Firms Opens in NYC

     [October 1] New York City-based Transaction Information Systems (TIS),
     an integration and information technology consulting company, opened
     FLITE <http://www.flitelab.com>, an open software factory dedicated to
     building electronic commerce solutions for the financial industry.

     In addition to TIS, the founder of FLITE, there are approximately 20
     member firms, including Digital Equipment Corp., ad agency Foote, Cone
     and Belding, IBM, Lotus Development Corp., Reuters, Sybase, and Visa.

     FLITE is physically located in the former home of the historic New
     York Lawyers' Club at 115 Broadway in downtown Manhattan. FLITE allows
     sales, marketing, and information technology executives to interact
     with a variety of online trading systems, 401(k) management products,
     three-dimensional visualizations of financial data, and other
     electronic commerce and interactive customer service solutions.

     "This one-of-a-kind software factory enables financial institutions to
     increase sales and market reach via the rapid deployment of their
     financial products through multiple distribution vehicles, including
     the Internet, kiosks, display cellular phones and TV sets," said Bob
     Gold, President of TIS.

     "In one place, they can experience and visualize more electronic
     commerce and customer service applications for the financial industry
     than anywhere else. FLITE's design process and electronic commerce
     tools allow us to roll out transactional Web sites in half the time
     and at half the cost of the industry average."

     FLITE is a working lab that financial institutions can use to produce
     innovative products. Marketing/sales executives use the facility to
     learn to think interactively and develop Internet strategies, build
     product prototypes rapidly and conduct focus groups.

     Technology staffs can use the facility for jointly developing
     interactive products with FLITE engineers, use FLITE's specialty rooms
     (user interface optimization, 3-D visualization and quality assurance
     testing), and get hands-on training and knowledge transfer.

     As a factory, FLITE has specialized machinery and tools for building
     transactional Web sites and delivering products through interactive
     distribution channels, TIS said. FLITE has a variety of hardware
     servers, workstations, laptops, kiosks, televisions, display phones,
     touchscreen monitors, and financial trading equipment.

     "FLITE combines the promise of new technology with the city's
     financial heritage," said Gold. "Unlike other companies who have put
     research and development facilities in the suburbs, TIS believes that
     its downtown location in the heart of Wall Street attracts the top
     talent in the industry and makes it accessible to financial industry
     executives."
