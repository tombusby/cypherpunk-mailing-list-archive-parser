There are two really major beaches in the L.A. area that I know of.
One is Bolsa Chica, several miles long, north of Huntington Beach,
which attracts most of the young'uns south of L.A., and Zuma in the
northmost points of Malibu, which gets a lot of Valley people
(fer sure).  To quote the L.A. Weekly of a few years ago, in a
"Best of L.A." review, "Why do all those hot young girls go to Zuma?
Because that's where all the hot young boys are."

But the real babes don't go there.  They get skates and nifty little
costumes and zip up and down the boardwalks in Santa Monica and
Pacific Palisades mostly, in case some hot producer/director should
happen along.
