No doubt VerityMonger knows this, but many others may not: "New World
Order" was a phrase originally coined by Josef Goebbels.

Interestingly, the term "European Community" arose out of German
industrial discussion groups in ~1944 who were trying to find a way to
salvage the German position at the time.  One idea was to make peace
and attempt to establish a "European Community".
