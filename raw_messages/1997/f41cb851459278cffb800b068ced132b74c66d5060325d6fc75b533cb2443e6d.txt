Militia <> Army.

Exactly, they were militia NOT federal troops. This is EXACTLY why we have
the militia mentioned in the 2nd. With there being no mechanism to
constitutionaly employ federal troops against Americans there had to be some
means to maintane the peace. In addition there needed to be some mechanism
to prevent the federals from mis-using those troops hence the 2-year limit
at the federal level for all monies expended on federal troops. No such
limit applies to monies given to the states to fund their individual
militias. Which are LOANED to the federal government with the consent of the
govenor of the particular states. The idea being that if the fed's mis-use
those troops the govenor simply orders them to stand down. Without voluntary
help from the states the feds should be powerless inside the borders of the
US.

I suspect that there is a certain level of misrepresentation of what went on
during the Whiskey Rebellion (which I was aware of before your elucidation).
Near as I can tell Washington acted responsibly within the bounds of the
intent and word of the Constitution.
