Hmmm.  There has been some of that, but some of use who have spoken about
freedom of speech have done so because of legitimate concerns, not just to
gain advantage in an ongoing, juvenile campaign.

Not completely.  The plan John mentioned didn't elimainate the full version
of the list -- it just added a modertated version.  There will still be
some garbage floating through Toad Hall, but not as much :)

I think the idea of two versions of the list is an excellent one, and it
avoids the issues raised by presenting the list in only a moderated form.
If people want the spam they can have it, and if they don't they can take
advantage of John and Sandy's work, and read a more coherent version of the
list.  I will certainly choose the latter, but it is nice to know that the
choice is mine.  John and Sandy -- thanks for getting this rolling.
