The 'A special offer' posting was fraudulent, and from UUNet, not from the
NetWizards domain, or NetWizards newsservers. If you'll examine the
headers in the message, you will find this to be true. If you'd like to
complain, please contact the UUNet Administration. This is the second spam
this lamer has posted, and the only person he's hurting is himself, and
users of Usenet. 

Dozer (aka Bill Rockefeller) is the System Administrator at NetWizards,
and does NOT approve of spam in any way, shape or form. All of these
schemes are illegal, and a waste of time. Get a job, work for a living. :)
For more information on the REAL Dozer (not the SPAMMER), feel free
to drop by his homepage, at http://www.dozer.com, and look under Dozer's
section. Dozer also runs the Mustang 5.0 Mailing list for the Internet, 
if you have a Modified Mustang 5.0, or are interested in them, email 
50ml@netwiz.net. 

We apologize for any confusion the poor misguided soul that posted the 
fraudulent message may have caused. :)

Note: Mailbombing this address is quite useless. It filters all 
mailbombs, etc, and has unlimited space.
