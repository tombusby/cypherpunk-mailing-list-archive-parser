Firstly: have you done a comprehensive survey of corporate access
systems available to commerce.

Secondly: there are a number of other forces "encouraging" the GAK
model.  Government incentives: Europe companies and research groups
get given research funding to experiment with GAK/TTP architectures.
Either the architecture is stipulated as part of the call for
proposals, or proposals involving GAK are going to get funding more
easily.

Third: people involved with key recovery at all have tended to be
defense contractor types, who are more likely to go with government
"standards" (such as TTPs/clipper/tessera/etc).

I was under the impression that PGP Inc had done it, or is working on
it.  It's not very hard at all, all you need is PGP's existing
multiple crypto-recipient feature.

The storage of your company master key needs some thought, but that's
a common problem with either your crypto key safe model or multiple
recipient model.

I have a memory.  I recall you made several posts where-in you said
you were against GAK.  Your line of argument seems to be that the rest
of us are misguided, or are allowing are dislike of GAK to cloud our
judgement on what a good crypto architecture GAK would be applied to
corporate key escrow.  Right?

I have no doubts as to your intelligence.  I understand what you are
trying to explain, and understood the first time you tried to explain;
I just disagree!  If you want to discuss your motives, the thing that
puzzles me is that your tone, overall apparent statist tendencies, and
zest on this topic are at odds with your stance on GAK.  Did you ever
come across a guy called David Sternlight?  (Clearly an intelligent
guy, but having a tendency to hang on to arguments, and stir up flame
wars, in his case I'm sure this was intentional.)  Not equating you to
Sternlight, though there are some similarities in style.

Perhaps it is just that some of us reacted negatively when you first
bought this topic up, and you are still acting in retaliatorily
hostile manner as a result of this.  Remember it was you who called
for rational calm discussion.  People impute from your apparent
statist leanings, and your arguments against people who are against
the key-safe model because of the possibility of helping build a GAK
infrastructure that you are pro-GAK.  Perhaps you need to disclaim
this more clearly.

If I believed GAK architecture was superior to multiple-recipient, and
was arguing this I don't think I'd come across in the same way.

I'm not sure that multiple recipient is that much less useful to GAK
than the safe model, buf if it is at all less useful, and the systems
otherwise basically equivalent I would argue against the safe model
for that reason alone.  However I consider the safe model inferior in
several areas neglecting this issue anyway.

I contend that there are similar and mostly comparable problems with
the safe model.  Lets take a look at a few:

Kent says give all the keys to Acme corp, or let Acme corp generate
the keys.  Who is Acme Corp?

The next bit is as a result of multiple recipient being more flexible
than the safe model as stated.  We now have freedom to allow different
elements in the company to audit and access different departments
communications.  Naturally this extra flexibility results in policy
decisions.

If making policy decisions is too complex in your view for
implementation or practicality, well just substitute a policy dumbed
down to the level of the safe model.  Ie there is one crypto
recipient, all company communications _must_ be encrytped to it as a
second crypto recipient.

Policy distribution is something Netscape has been doing; apparently
the difference between it's browsers is largely a signed policy file
with a mildly obfuscated public verification key check in the code.

I'm sure you can arrange this same flexibility and bring in the
baggage of the policy decisions that come with it for the safe model
also if you want it.  Store keys for different departments in
different safes.  Give the master keys for the department to the
department head, etc.,etc.  Same problem, similar policy decisions,
right?

As stated above, this is because you have chosen a single master key
to go with the safe model.  If you choose a single crypto-recipient,
and master key encrypting the private half of that key, you largely
have equivalence.

Or similarly insecure.  They are quite similar, I think multiple
recipient offers more flexibility, and security advantages, as well as
avoiding the sharing of private keys.

Sign the policy file.  Certify the signing key(s).  You're going to
have this anway for authentication of email content.

It does for the same functionality.  With the key-safe model how do
you know that the ciphertexts flowing out of the building are
encrypted with a key that is in your safe at all?

You don't have to do the binding cryptography stuff with multiple
recipients if you don't want to.  With the safe model you can't do it
even if you do want to.

For storage encryption keys where backups are not plaintext, I agree.
For communication keys, you do not need to backup.  Doing so weakens
security.  Communications keys should be transient, forward secret
even.  Authentication keys should be persistent, back up not required,
just generate new key, and new certificates if lost.  Storage keys
should be backed up where necessary.

With the safe model, to allow access to outgoing mail, you'll have to
encrypt to a company key as second crypto-recipient, or to yourself,
thereby allowing company access through access to your key.  Quite
similar to multiple recipient.  Similar explanation.
