:Paranoid yet?  Good.  That's a healthy state to be in.  Fortunately,
:most developers (like Joel) don't put any such evil hooks into
:their software.  Having access to the source, to be able to read
:through it yourself, is IMO one of the better ways to be sure about
:such things. Reading the source and recompiling it yourself is
:probably the best.

:Still paranoid?  Excellent.

Paranoia!! I love that word :)...What about somebody snooping on my phoneline, while I type the passphrase? :)
