  I was testing the procedure outlined in Epilogue 5 of InfoWar
on a friend's machine and, sure enough, I got PGP 2.62 to spit
out the private key he had created as Necessarily Knott, ME.

  Perhaps we have inadvertently taken key-signing to a new level.
i.e. - develop software that will allow a user to have another
user sign the key and then, when revoked, the software allows
the user to sign with the revoked key, but not to recreate it
or change it in any way.
  The software could be marketed to cryptographers with low
self-esteem.

  I added the secret key to the keyserver, and it also said it
had accepted it, but does not show it on a query.

  Yep. That confirms that your message was sent by someone who
is Neccesarily Knott, ME.

  Took a few days for you to reply to the message. Have you been
waiting for the wee hours to see if you could narrow down the
list of senders by seeing who is online at the time you receive
a reply?
  I could add latency to this anonymous email, but that would
be tacky.
