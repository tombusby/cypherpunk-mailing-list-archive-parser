It's probably too much effort for them to bother with. If you were a
spammer, and wanted loads of addresses, how would you get them? Headers
are the most address-rich part of the message, so you just get headers
from the server. Then you look for addresses with a regex. Looking for
mangled addresses means that now you have to have two regexes, which
increases your search time for not much benefit. No, the only ones which
will bother will be the spiteful ones...

With the address munging on USENET posts, you have to do a bit of work in
order to even find the actual forged address (look at the headers, dig out
Author-Address:, unmangle it), and by then you ought to be wondering, Did
this person really send this?

Ah. When munging, I just use: sendmail -bv -- $ADDR and then a bit of sed
magic. If anything can parse it correctly, it's sendmail.

On cracker, you can paste To:, CC:, and Bcc:. All are checked against the
destination block file. At present, if a blocked address is on a list of
addresses, the entire list is blocked. Maximum number of recipients is 20,
at which point the whole thing is dropped.

Sender: we don't allow, or X-Sender: or Received: or Comments:
authenticated sender is. Reply-To: is allowed, and checked against the
destination block list. In practice, this stuff doesn't seem to be a
problem.
