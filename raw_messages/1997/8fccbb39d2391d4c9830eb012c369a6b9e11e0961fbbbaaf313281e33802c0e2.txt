I jsut went and got myself a copy of this.  It's frustratingly hard to get
to compile.  The source directories are all missing header files (filling
src/include with all the headers via symlinks seems to work) but other
files seem to be missing.  Is there a better distribution of this than the
mess on pgpi.com?
