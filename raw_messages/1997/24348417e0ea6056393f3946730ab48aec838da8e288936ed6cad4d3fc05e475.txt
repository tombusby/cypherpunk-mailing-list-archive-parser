Exactly, StrongHold is the one making the claims of security, it behooves
them to address any and all criticisms of their product.

Which is sufficient reason not to use the StrongHold product or anything
else put out by them. Any company which desires to suppress opinions or
discussion over their product clearly has something to hide. This is what I
tell my customers and they seem to understand the utility of such an 
approach.

Never support strong-arm tactics, honest people don't need them.
