In California, they have those infamous Prop-nnn's, and the exercises
the leg'os have to do to get around them could fill volumes.  Here
in the Land of Sunshine your son or daughter can begin their dream
quest in the fry section of the local McD's, then when they graduate
I.S. from Cal-State (Indentured Servant, $200,000 student loans),
they can move right on up to waterboy/girl for Barbara Boxer and
her mindless goon assistants.

To begin with, all politicians should be required to ride around in
limos with the top down.  If it rains, let 'em use umbrellas.  The
guys standing by the road watching will be smart enough to bring their
umbrellas [hee hee].
