Ah, so when I send my messages to "cypherpunks@algebra.com" they come back
more quickly from toad.com? Somehow I doubt this.

I've been sending nearly all of my posts to either the algebra.com or the
cyberpass.net addresses, and the toad.com address is set to expire, or so
John told us when he gave us a deadline for finding another site. I've
mentioned this a couple of times, and yet some of you seem to think the
toad.com address is the preferred, fastest one.

Would some of the operators of the distributed lists comment on the time
delays, on the topology of the interlinked distributed list, and on what
role, if any, toad.com continues to play in the process? Igor, Lance, Jim,
John?

Posts like this one from Anonymous, while perhaps accurate (or perhaps not,
I really don't know) are not as convincing as words straight from those
involved.
