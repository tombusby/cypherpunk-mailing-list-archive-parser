So when I look at someone's facial expression, I'm using photons, and 
the FCC can regulate this activity as an 'electronic communication'?
This seems to be what you are suggesting.

I have this niggling memory at the back of my mind to the
effect that the FCC regulates nothing above a certain
frequency (somewhere in the microwave region). I don't
know if this is an internal rule, or something imposed on
them by charter or congress.

I'm not sure what the limit is. The highest frequency I've
been able to find regulations for is 105 GHz, the upper 
edge of a band reserved for SETI research in Britain. The
highest FCC reg I've seen tops out at 77 GHz. 

This is all far below the frequencies of light used in 
fiber optic networks.

Anything above about 100GHz seems to be unregulated.
