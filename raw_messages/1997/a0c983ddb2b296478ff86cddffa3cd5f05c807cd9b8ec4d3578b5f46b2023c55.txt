Just out of curiousity I did a search on pathfinder.com :)

CyberPatrol:
    http://binone.pathfinder.com/cgi-bin/boa SexActs

CyberSitter:
    pathfinder.com

SurfWatch:
    http://bubblemouth.pathfinder.com/@@srbndqaaaaaaaeeg/vibe/archive/independant/blackspot
    http://mouth.pathfinder.com/@@srbndqaaaaaaaeeg/vibe/archive/independant/blackspot


No surprise that Cybersitter has the entire domain blocked. Odd the
SurfWatch blocks the archives for Vibe magazine yet does not block
www.vibe.com. The URL blocked by CyberPatrol is invalid.

There was someone who did this awhile back and promptly had his domain
blocked by these self appointed protectors of "Truth, Democracy, and The
American Way".

I was rather disappointed (though not surprised) watching the Censorship
Summit a couple of weeks ago that no one took these self appointed Censors
to task on the fact that they block sites not mearly on the type of
information contained (sex,drugs,violence,...ect) but also block based on
political content that disagrees with their own beliefs. Sure fire way to
get a site blocked is not to put "dirty" pictures up on it but to put up
anything that brings to light the actions of these groups.

An intriguing side note is that ALL these groups considers their Censor
Lists to be IP. Add that with the new Criminalization of copyright
infringement and we may see Declan sharing a cell with Jim Bell. :)
