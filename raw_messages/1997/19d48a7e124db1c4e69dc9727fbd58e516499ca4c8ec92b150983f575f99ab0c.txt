I guess the good news is, we've finally figured out why
they've been holding him so long before sentencing--to make
sure he doesn't miss any of his scheduled media events.
Or perhaps, given the nature of the coverage, to make sure
he *does* miss them all.  We need a good posterboy for one
of the Four Horsemen, to ensure the passage of next year's
Guaranteeing Freedom through Imposition of a Benevolent
Police State Act of 1999, and the following year's
appointment of first lady Tipper Gore as Internet Czar.
