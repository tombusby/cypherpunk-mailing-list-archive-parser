Interestingly, I don't even believe there is such a thing as "the white
race." The 19th century classification of homo sapiens into Negroid,
Caucasoid, and Mongoloid, the putative "three races," is without merit.

Based on certain external characteristics, there are at least a dozen
"races." And the concept is largely meaningless. Italians are as "far" from
Swedes as, say, Thais are from Han Chinese. The point being....

The point being  I don't care what race a person is officially classed as
(and yet I had to racially classify job applicants when I was at Intel,
courtesy of the EEOC rules on quotas).

I call a spade a spade.
