This is very worrisome to me. Miami author Paul Levine wrote a novel
a while back about using a naturally-occurring chemical available to
the medical profession called succhylcholine (sp?) to commit murder
almost untraceably.

He was inspired by someone trying it, and I think people have tried
it since, and the novel could be said to be a how-to, but nobody has
tried to stop him from making money on the book. This case, by looking
to the content of the how-to, promises to turn poorly-written how-to
books into poorly-written novels, I guess. (Levine's book is well-
written and a fun read, but not every author is Paul Levine.)
