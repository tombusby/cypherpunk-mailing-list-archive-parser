Free Wallpaper Tip!!!!

A lot of people have had dark wallpaper installed or have
installed it  themselves, over a light colored wall,
and over time the wall shows through because the seams have expanded.

_____________________________________________________

Here is how to remedy this problem.

Take a latex (eggshell finish) paint tinted to the color of the 
wallpaper background. Paint seam about 3ft down the wall
with a small paint brush. (1inch)  Wipe off immediately, and continue
on down to  finish off the seam. Repeat on every seam that needs it.
Move the brush up and down to color the wall in between seams.
