Thanks to Greg Broiles's FOIA effort and Lucky Green, 
we offer the first US public release of:

   The Wassenaar Arrangement - 
   List of Dual Use-Goods and Technologies 
   and Munitions List, July 1996

   http://jya.com/wa/watoc.htm

This is the 200-page document Greg previously
announced here which lists in minute detail the
wide range of goods and technologies to be restricted 
by arms and trade export controls.

The Wassenaar Arrangement succeeds COCOM as
the arms control regime signed by 33 nations.

Cryptography is covered in Category 5 - Part 2:
