For those not on the cypherpunks@toad list, there have been
a few messages on the Bernstein decision which seem not to 
have been forwarded to the other lists, apparently because they
were sent directly by "bernstein-announce@toad.com."

We've put them on our site and can be browsed at:

   http://jya.com/crypto.htm

The latest last night from Bernstein's attorney is that the USG
has gotten a stay from Patel's on her August 25 decision (see
PGP Inc. message below). The stay removes protections from 
those who may have posted Snuffle to the Web (as JYA did). 

Hence, we've removed the two versions of Snuffle we had
hosted.  After, we note, DoJ and Commerce had downloaded
the evidence and our vitae. DoJ's Anthony Coppolino would 
not discuss the stay when I called him at 202-514-4782.

However, we would like to offer lieu of the Snuffle files links
to offshore sites if there are any who wish to host the US national 
security threats.

Adam Back posted one version here a few days back, and
Purdue has Dan's 1990 original offer to sci.crypt. For leads
to the two see:

Too bad.  Prof. Bernstein was perfectly positioned to become a great -- and
the only legal -- exporting reseller of PGP software.  (no, this is not off
the record)

"If all the personal computers in the world - ~260 million computers - were
put to work on a single PGP-encrypted message, it would still take an
estimated 12 million times the age of the universe, on average, to break a
single message."
