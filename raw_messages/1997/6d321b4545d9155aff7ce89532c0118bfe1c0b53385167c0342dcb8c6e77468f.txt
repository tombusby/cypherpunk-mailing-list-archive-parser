The next version of PGP will offer the combination of El Gamal for
encryption and Digital Signature Standard (DSS) for signatures, as
an alternative to RSA.  These are based on the discrete log problem.

El Gamal is really almost the same as Diffie-Hellman.  You have a
secret x, he has a secret y, and together you calculate g^(xy) which
is your shared secret.  With DH you then just use that shared secret
as your message encryption key; with El Gamal you multiply (or xor,
or add...) your key with the shared secret.  PGP uses El Gamal so that
we can send along not only key info but also which algorithm to use for
the message body encryption, and also a checksum.

It is true that El Gamal encrypted messages will be about 128 bytes bigger
than RSA for 1024 bit keys.  DSS on the other hand produces somewhat
smaller signatures than RSA, by about 85-90 bytes.  But neither of these
is really significant in typical applications.

The Diffie-Hellman patent expires September 6, 1997.  I gather that it
would also cover El Gamal since that is a variant.  The Hellman-Merkle
"knapsack" patent, which claims to cover all public key cryptography,
expires October 6, 1997.  After that date, at least some forms of public
key cryptography will be unpatented in the U.S.  The RSA patent expires
September 20, 2000.  It is possible that the next three years will see
greater use of discrete log cryptography because of the patent state,
although RSA has a significant "brand" advantage in the business market.
(This patent info is from "Handbook of Applied Cryptography", from
Menezes et al, which I recommend as a supplement to Schneier.)
