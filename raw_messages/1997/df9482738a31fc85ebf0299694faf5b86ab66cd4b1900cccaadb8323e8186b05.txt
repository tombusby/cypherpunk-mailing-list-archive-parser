That may not be what they _intended_, but it's what they said..  
They're very explicit that using "within a commercial business or facility"  
is commercial, and they're including government agencies and organizations.
That means if you're using it in a government-owned building,
it's commercial from their license's standpoint.

If they hadn't explicitly said "facility", that might be a reasonable
interpretation, but they've provided carefully crafted language 
that's pinning down a very broad definition of commercial.

If they want to go that direction, well, it's their code (mostly.)
But it's a much different direction from the previous policies.
