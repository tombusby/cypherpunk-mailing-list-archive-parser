Yes, there are a number of other one-way functions.  The Diffie-Hellman
algorithm relies on the difficulty in taking logarithms versus finding
an exponent.  Elliptic-curve cryptography relies on some rather
complicated group theory.  Look either of those up to find out some more
information.

If you're interested in learning about this kind of stuff, I HIGHLY
recommend Bruce Schneier's Applied Cryptography.  Another good book is
the Handbook of Applied Cryptography by Paul Van Oorschot, Alfred
Menenzes and Scott Vanstone.
