Hate e-mail case to be retried

SANTA ANA, Calif., Dec. 2 (UPI) _ Saying the case has national importance,
federal prosecutors will
retry a 20-year-old man accused of sending threatening electronic mail to
Asian students at UC Irvine. 

Prosecutors announced their decision while opposing a bail request for
Richard Machado of Los
Angeles, the first person in the United States to be tried on charges of
committing a hate crime over the
Internet. 

His first trial on those charges ended with a deadlocked jury in November.
Jurors voted 9 to 3 to acquit
the former UC Irvine student. 

Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Genaco told Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler
that it is important that the
case be resolved because other similar cases are certain to occur. 

Stotler denied bail for Machado, noting that he fled to Mexico when he was
first charged. 

Machado's retrial is scheduled to begin Jan. 27.
