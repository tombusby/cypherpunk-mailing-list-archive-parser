Thanks to everybody for their interesting contributions to the partial
signature problem.

This approach looks like the best to me.  It's a bit cumbersome for
the person doing the quoting, but that's as it should be.

It's easy to see why we would want other people to sign with
signatures which enable partial quoting, but it's less clear why we
would sign our own messages this way.

For instance, somebody might want to quote my private e-mail out of
context where I say "Yes, I'm real glad I got rid of that guy.  He was
really a pest."  But they might not want to quote the part of the
message where I say "Thanks for the latest shipment of plastic
explosives."  In order to authenticate their claim they have to reveal
the entire message.  If they must quote the entire message for
authentication, it will discourage tacky behavior such as relaying
private messages.

So, this is sort of a solution looking for an application.  It seems
like an interesting problem and I have a strong intuitive sense that a
use for it will present itself at some point.
