I haven't had time to search for any more information on the law, but if this
law bans _all_ cookies, then this is just another example of the technological
cluelessness that exists in various governments.  I don't agree with any
restrictions on cookies, but if there are going to be any, then the least they
could do is allow cookies if the HTML page indicates somewhere on it that it
is sending a cookie.  This would prevent companies like "Doubleclick" from
gathering information, but would permit "legitimate" uses.
