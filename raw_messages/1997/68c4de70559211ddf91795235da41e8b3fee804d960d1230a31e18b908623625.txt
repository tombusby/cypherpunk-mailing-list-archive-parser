Excuse me, but this modern notion that protestors get to "make a deal"
about the fines they'll eventually pay is bogus. If they're trespassing,
they're trespassing. They don't get to take over Intel's factory, chain
themselves to the Evil Factory doors, and then make a deal to pay some
token fine.

Like the AIDS protestors who "arrange" a deal whereby they'll shut down the
Golden Gate Bridge for several hours and then pay their arranged $50
tickets.

Well, what's wrong with me driving up to the head of the sit-down protest
and saying to the cops standing idly by, "Hey, there are some queers in the
middle of the road, blocking my trip to Marin. If you're just gonna let em
sit there for hours, putting my business and plans at risk, I'm just gonna
gun my engine and drive right over their fairy asses."

Crimes are crimes, not "guerilla theater." Not "performance art."

(And I was one of the organizers of "Critical Smash," a counter-rally of
truck drivers and fed up motorists who met the "Critical Mess" bicyclists
planning to "shut down" major intersections.)

I had a much better idea back then. Leave the mothers and childrens chained
to the fences and gates.

Pull back from them, erect a cordon around them, and block anyone from
approaching.  They wanted to be chained to the fence, sans keys, so let
them have their wish.

Others could show up to throw stuff at them, and place bets on who would be
the last to die.

And, as the flesh dripped off and the bones whitened, it might be a nice
object lesson for the others.
