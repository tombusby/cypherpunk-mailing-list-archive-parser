News reports this morning that the OECD is moving out of strictly economic
matters and is focussing on "child porn," calling a special meeting in July
to discuss the laws of various countries and how they can be regularized to
control the availability of porn and child porn on the Net.

(The OECD is the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, or
some permutation like that, and is a kind of "economic NATO," but with
various non-European players. It was the OECD that David Aaron was special
ambassador to, before assuming his current duties as Crypto Tsar.)

So, one of the Horsemen is being invoked to control the Net.

(And the story on CNN right after this one was about cryptography, with
"drug smugglers and terrorists" prominently mentioned. The spin was that
citizen-units need cryptography on the Net so that they'll feel more secure
about Net commerce and thus buy more stuff, but that the security cannot be
good enough to make the drug smugglers and terrorists--not to mention the
pornographers!--safe from being caught.)

The war is moving into its next phase.

Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
