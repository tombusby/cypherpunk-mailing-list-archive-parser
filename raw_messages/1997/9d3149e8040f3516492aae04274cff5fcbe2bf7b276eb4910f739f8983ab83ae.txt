   I didn't get a rogue client. I got a client off of your ftp server.
And I have no idea what it is doing.

  Is it doing the kind of math that cracks encryption? Or the kind of 
math
that fucks up hard-drives and operating systems?
  It seems to like to access the hard drive for two solid minutes for no
apparent reason while it is connected to your server and, according to
the message, "sleeping." A lot of things can be done in two minutes of
access to a hard drive.

  I can appreciate that you seem to have been playing in the backyard
with friends when the whole neighborhood decided to show up and play
with you, but you should realize that if you are serious about gaining
enough support to take your best shot at the DES Crack, that you will
have to provide strangers with enough info to feel comfortable about
running your software on their machines and those of their employers,
etc.
  Some of my readers have sent me email asking if they should be 
concerned about running this-or-that software on their business
boxes, and I tell them, "You should be concerned about everything
you run on your business machine."
   "It's uh, doing some math or something..." isn't a very good basis
for people to run the software on a few million bucks worth of hardware.

  I don't think it is a waste of bandwith to question whether people
should feel comfortable downloading and running applications which
provide neither source code nor documentation that can be used to
judge the competence and/or integrity of those producing it.

  Yet you still call me a fucking retard for wanting to be able
to verify that your software isn't going to turn my machine into
a toaster?

  This doesn't matter for shit if you have nothing in place to provide
info in this regard for those participating in your group effort.

  Since my efforts have led to me finding out that I have a "bum client",
the bandwidth is serving my purpose very well.

  Does this include us 'retards' who are 'wasting bandwidth'?

  I am sure that you all are taking great pains to develop the best
possible software for this endeavor, but unless you take care of the
'information' end of the spectrum, you will lose the participation of
those people who require a certain level of assurance that your 
softare meets a decent standard of competence, and that someone is
actually in charge and paying attention.
