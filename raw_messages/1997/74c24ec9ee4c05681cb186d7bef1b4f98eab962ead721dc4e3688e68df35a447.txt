You should have done your research better.

This report by the Cato Institute based on a report by the Urban Institute
is based on *Legal* Immigrants.

>Studies that report a decline in immigrant income and education levels
>often referred to as immigrant "quality" fail to take into account the
>fact that U.S. census data do not differentiate by immigration status.
>Legal immigrants, refugees and illegal immigrants are all included in
>U.S. censuses. But refugees and illegal immigrants have tended to be
>poorer and less educated on average than other immigrants. 

In after reviewing the some of the documents at the Urban Institute web
site http://www.urban.org I would hardly call them a libertarian
orginization.
