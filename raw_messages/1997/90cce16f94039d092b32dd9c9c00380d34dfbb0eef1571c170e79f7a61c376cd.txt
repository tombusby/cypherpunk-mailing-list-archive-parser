It has long been known that the artists, the lunatics and the criminal
element in society are a harbinger of the future.
 What is less known is that the way society deals with them is also
a harbinger of the future.

  Supporting Nazi Fascist Oppressors who campaign under slogans that
share the underlying theme "Tough On the 'Other Guy'" can be a very
tempting prospect.
  Waking up to find that *you* have been officially declared "The 
'Other Guy'" is not uncommon, however.

NEWS FLASH!!!
 When John Law enforces that "Tough on Crime" law that you supported,
he is not going to risk his butt by going after armed felons such as
Tim May, as you had intended. He is going to go after unarmed felons
who supported the new laws, little realizing that they, themselves,
were "Felons under an increasing number of laws."
(Don't bother to check the archives. I said that first. Trust me.)
