Michael, you once again fail to note the important political issues here. 
Sometimes civil liberties, freedom, and constitutional rights must be
ignored in favor of pragmatism. It is important at all costs to remain a
player in the game. 

Instead of opposing bad crypto legislation, we should instead work inside
the process, to gain a seat at the table. That is why it is highly
significant that both Commerce and FBI want to rid us of our freedom but
would do it in subtly different ways.
