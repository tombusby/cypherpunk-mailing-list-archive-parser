Withdraw it? Apologize for it?

I am free to call for the execution of anyone I damned well wish. OJ,
McVeigh, the English nanny, Lawton Chiles, and so on. The First Amendment
doesn't contain exceptions for such things.

Sen. Jesse Helms was not prosecuted, nor even sanctioned by the Senate, for
saying that if President Clinton ever visits Georgia he'd better be wearing
a bulletproof vest.

Face it, Anonymous, free speech means just that. Short of directly
threatening the President or his family, or issuing direct (credible,
proximate) threats to judges and perhaps some others, we as Americans are
free to call for OJ to be taken out and have his throat cut, figuratively
speaking, to call for trials for various criminals (including political
criminals), and to speculate as we wish about whether the OKC bombing was a
good thing or not. Get used to it, Anonymous, as it's the law.

Maybe I don't "withdraw" comments or "apologize" for them because I don't
do either. Ever think of that, Anonymous halfwit?

(Anonymity has certain aspects, good and bad. I notice, though, that an
inordinate number of my critics are using "Anonymous." Probably just one
frustrated do-gooder who can't stand the tenor of the list, but chooses to
remain anonymous out of simpering fear.)

I mean what I say and I say what I mean. Get used to it. Or leave, even better.
