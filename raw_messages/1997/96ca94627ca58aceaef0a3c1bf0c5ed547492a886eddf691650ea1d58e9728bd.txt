Once again, the advantages of an "uncoordinated search" should be
mentioned. An uncoordinated search, in which people randomly search chunks
of keyspace is obviously less efficient than a coordinated search where no
part of the space is searched two or more times.

However, an uncoordinated search is only less efficient by a small factor
of two or three, with a 95% probability that the key will be found with an
effort "only" 3 times greater than with a coordinated search. (The Poisson
probability distribution is what's involved here, and the math is fairly
easy to work out.)

A 2-4x factor is significant, and may warrant a coordinated search.
However, the various problems implicit in coordinated searches are factors,
too.

Also, an uncoordinated search solves the "prize" problem, as whomever finds
the key makes  the contact with RSADSI.

One of the problems with a coordinated search, if the remaining keyspace to
be doled out is publically announced, is that as the keyspace is searched
and a key _not_ found, the remaining keyspace is increasingly more tempting
for "independent searchers" to search. Sort of the way the odds on some
lotteries actually become "acceptable" as the lottery pot grows. The
organizer of the coordinated search must then, I surmise, keep the
assignments secret and dole out keyspace securely.

Having the prize money go to the finder of the key, as opposed to some
artificial division between EFF, Gutenberg, etc., is also an incentive for
people to contribute more CPU time.

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
