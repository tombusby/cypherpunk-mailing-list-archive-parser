Incidentally, I think the patches I have for premail would probably
reduce the effects of an attack like this. It adds a
reliability-threshold and latency-threshold. Any remailer more reliable
than the reliability-threshold (recommended: 99.5%) is treated as if the 
uptime was 100%. Latencies lower than the latency threshold are treated
as zero. On a good day, this means there are several remailers which
will score exactly the same before the shuffling factor is added. The
four spook remailers listed would all score the same as squirrel and
bureau42, which have latencies exceeding 3 hrs:

This is not why I came up with the patch. Originally I came up with the
reliability-threshold when I was running as a middleman and wanted to make
sure I was picking good remailers. I find that for chaining, chain lengths
of 1 and 2 tend to be somewhat slower on average than with standard
premail. However, longer chains tend to be significantly faster and even
more reliable. Check out http://anon.efga.org/anon/remailer-chains.html
and look at the distribution of remailers selected in chains, and compare
my random chain stats against Raph's. (I have a couple of remailers he
doesn't, AFAIK.)

Agreed, but the danger from attack like this lies with automatic chaining
programs, where the user may not even be aware of what remailers are on
the list, or what remailers were chosen. A PGP-signed version would
improve things, particular if a special signing key is used, and that key
is stored in a separate keyring. This PGP-version may have to be available
separately from the regular remailer list to avoid confusing chaining
programs.

I'll see if I can whip up a PGP-signed version of the EFGA remailer list
by the end of the day.
