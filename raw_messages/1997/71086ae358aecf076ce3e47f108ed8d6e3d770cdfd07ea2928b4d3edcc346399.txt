Yes, there would be scatter, but it is not important.  Population size
is *obviously* a strong determinant of government size.  Clearly, China
(population 1,000,000,000) is going to have a *far* larger government than
Dominica (population 100,000).  This difference far overshadows 
the fact that governments for similar sized countries may vary 
considerably in size -- Dominica will *never* have a government larger 
than China.

You are thinking of the *ratio* of population to government size.  That
is a factor, but, relatively, an inconsequential one.  Country
populations vary by orders of magnitude, whereas the scatter you 
describe might be by one order of magnitude.

So, having clearly established that larger countries will on balance 
have larger governments, we can then just look at organizational 
dynamics.  *Any* large organization requires more infrastructure to 
function.  *Any* large organization will develop bureaucracy.  This 
is true for governments, this is true for businesses, this is true 
for schools, this is true for militias.  A big city police department 
will have many different precints, with multiple layers of 
management, a small town will have a chief of police and a few 
deputies.
