The L.A. Times quotes this "poll" all the time, and in fact probably
just made it up.  Why do I know that?  Because they ran a "letter"
from a "teacher" in the valley somewhere about a year ago which said
exactly this same thing.  The "teacher" ran a poll of her students
and they agreed to give up the rights without even knowing which
rights they were giving up.
