Sorry to say, but I don't completely get you idiosyncratic language.

My perception of it is that when you explain thoses things to 
productive individuals, i.e. individuals that get a lot of their 
money confiscated, most of them get quite interested while if you 
talk about the capability of talking dirty to your lover without your 
mother in law being able to know, they yawn faster than you can say 
"bit".

Thus, IMO, brigning the discussion on the ground of taxation would be 
an attention getter.  At least concerning the "guerilla" spreading of 
crypto, as Tim mentionned.
