+New encryption bill on way
+By Alex Lash

+Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Montana) next week will reintroduce legislation 
+aimed at wiping out most Commerce Department restrictions on the 
+export of software encryption, his press secretary said today.

+The new version of the so-called Pro-Code bill, which died in the 
+Senate Commerce Committee last year after a series of high-profile 
+hearings, will be unchanged and should have the same support it 
+gained in the 1996 session, Burns's press secretary Matt Raymond said.
+"The language was not something that was arrived at lightly," Raymond 
+said. "We should have time for a more robust and considerate debate" 
+compared with last year's unsuccessful rush to get the bill passed, 
+he added.

+Burns, a leading figure on the Senate Commerce Committee, is set to 
+appear via satellite Tuesday at the RSA Data Security Conference in 
+San Francisco to announce the bill's reintroduction.

+Foes of the Clinton administration's current encryption regulations, 
+which became effective on January 1, are looking for Congress to 
+legislate more liberal export guildelines. Last year, the Pro-Code 
+bill won the support of many key members of Congress  who remain in 
+office and want to modify Clinton's encryption plan.
