  Sure the 'system' is working. Software patents were begun as a means
for
the government to exert control over the direction of software
development.
  It's the same thing as crypto-export regulations. They established a
dick-licking order for those who want to whore their way to riches 
under government rule. So now the quickest way to export your product
is to name it 'Crypto Light'.
