I've been looking this over and it's a nice job.  The code is clean
and orderly.  I haven't had a chance to play with it yet, but it looks
like everything is done the right way.  For example, it doesn't tell
you how many valid signatures a file has, it outputs a fragment of the
file for each valid signature.  The database of known keys has the
nice property that you can name each key anything you like.

The source code is completely unencumbered.  This is great!  For some
reason, it has been the custom to issue free software with all sorts
of restrictions, in particular restrictions which hamper its
commercial use.  But, if we are giving it away to people so they will
use it, why restrict it?  If somebody can use it to start a cypherpunk
company, this is a Good Thing.  (This can even be a Very Good Thing
for the original programmer. ;-)

It might be a good idea to publish the SHA1 checksum of the file you
are distributing.  The checksum of the file I got (cantsin.tar.gz)
was: D054C9E4ABD5CEE0C5A4343E5D1E2EF91C00048A

I may not approve of the restrictions on free speech in Germany, but
at least the German government isn't trying to stop people from
publishing arithmetic.  The truth is, that for Monty Cantsin's
activities, he would get a better deal on free speech if he were
German.
