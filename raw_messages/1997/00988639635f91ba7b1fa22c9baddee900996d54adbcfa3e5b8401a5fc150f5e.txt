Someone in alt.security.pgp reported that the Finland PGP site seems to be
denying access. I tried http://zone.pspt.fi/pgp/ and got a "Forbidden"
message.

Could just be a temporary glitch. Or a switch to a different URL. Anyone know?

But the paranoid part of me wonders if the hammer is finally coming down on
these offshore "pirate sites."

(Not piracy in any SPA sense, as PGP, Inc. is clearly complicit in
publishing the PGP source code books and encouraging Cypherpunks to pick up
stacks of them at Bay Area meetings for FedEx delivery to offhsore
sites.....but the OECD/Wasenaar Cabal clearly views this sort of thing
negatively. Perhaps Crypto Czar Aaron applied his rod to the cops in
Helsinki and the site went"stale." :-{)
