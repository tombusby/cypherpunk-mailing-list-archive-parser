Ach! Greg, that was supposed to be a "secret", since Jim said he didn't
want publicity over his case and I cheated by letting John post it on his
web site.   Although, it's not like most everyone suspected, hmh.

But anyway, what do you mean by saying that John's books were returned to him?
I sent a letter to Jim in the mail this past Saturday, encouraging him to
call me again and update me on his situation and on the sentencing date.
So I'll be waiting and will pass the info on to John.
