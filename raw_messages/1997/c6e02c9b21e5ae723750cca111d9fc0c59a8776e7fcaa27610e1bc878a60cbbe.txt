I prefer facts when it comes to making up my mind instead of baseless
claims.  For the others on this list who prefer the same, let me set the
record straight...

Yes, and you are the fabricator.  Bob claimed it happened in the 19th 
century (see Fact 1 below).  I claimed it happened in the early 18th 
century (see Fact 3 below).

For the umpteenth time, that was Bob's original claim, not mine.  See above.

Bullshit!  I did my homework.  You (and Bob) didn't.  But because I am a nice
guy, I share it with you here.

The bottomline is that you screwed up, Jim.  You misread my original post 
(confusing the 18th century for the 1800's) and started this whole chain of 
events.  The facts (not the claims) clearly bear this out.

[Once again, yes I did.  1815-1850 does not equal early 18th century!]

[Once again, Norton and myself referenced the Great Awakening to the
early 1700's/18th century: see Fact 3]
