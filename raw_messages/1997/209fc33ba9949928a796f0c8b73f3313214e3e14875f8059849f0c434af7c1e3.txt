  I wonder if it's possible/practical to do a FOIA request on Raph's
old permit request and why it didn't merit action. As I recall, he even
sent them a couple of the shirts. Then the export thugs could never-
respond to the FOIA request, I guess.

  Someday, the news media might even notice that it's an interesting
(and humorous) story.
