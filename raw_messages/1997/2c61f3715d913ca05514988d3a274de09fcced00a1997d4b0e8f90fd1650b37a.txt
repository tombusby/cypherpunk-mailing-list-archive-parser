Sure, it is duplicative.  However, for this thing to become law, I envision 
a rather dramatic shift in the organization of our intelligence 
institutions.  Or at least a change in some of the building names at Ft. 
Meade :)

There is an exective order or presidential decision directive (pdd) from 
the mid-80's that formalizes a "relationship" between the NSA and FBI for 
law enforcement decryption.  However, I never was able to get my hands on 
it ...
