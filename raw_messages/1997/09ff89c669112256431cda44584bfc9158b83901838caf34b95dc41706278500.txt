Well, I hope to have something for you soon. I've been too busy over the
last few months to work on it, but that may be changing. I'll make an
appropriate announcement when it's ready.

I mentioned this in another post, but USENET posts would simply have the
disclaimer and not a delivery notice.

I've made stats/keys/help for dustbin available via WWW at
http(s)?://porky.athensnet.com/~dustman/dustbin. The truly paranoid can
use https://www.anonymizer.com.

I have considered the possibility of auto-encrypting to recipients: 
Encrypt using the recipient's public key if it is on the remailer's
keyring or on the key server (which I can quickly check via http). Two
problems: What if the user generates a new key? Some mechanism needs to
exist for the user to inform the remailer, since it already has a key on
its keyring and won't check the server. And: Malicious users can put
phoney keys on the keyserver so the real user gets encrypted stuff that
they can't decrypt.  Solution: Keys need to be verified by magic cookie
exchange before they are used. Users mail their public keys to the
remailer, perhaps even through a remailer chain. The software gets their
e-mail address from the key ID, sends them an encrypted magic cookie, the
user decrypts with their secret key, mails it back to the remailer (signed
and encrypted). For a very low-risk remailer (more risky than middleman,
perhaps), you could require all recipients to supply PGP public keys
before delivering messages, an interesting twist on "PGP only" :). This
would be great for nym chains, not so great for other things, though the
remailer could resort to middleman operation in the case of recipients who
haven't supplied keys. Dustbin does something related already: If the
recipient is a known remailer, it doesn't chain; otherwise it selects a
remailer to chain through. (Note: I don't consider a USENET group a
"recipient".)

You can have my PGP public key by sending mail with subject "send file key".
You can have my PGP secret key when you pry it out of my cold, dead neurons.
