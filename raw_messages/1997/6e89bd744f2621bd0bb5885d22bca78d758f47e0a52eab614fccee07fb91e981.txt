There's an excellent but short interview with Cindy Cohn, the attorney
on the
Bernstein Snuffle case, on the San Jose Mercury site:
http://www.sjmercury.com/business/center/cohnqa121597.htm
She has a knack for getting to the crux in clear and logical steps.
Good stuff -- should make it all obvious to the judges!
