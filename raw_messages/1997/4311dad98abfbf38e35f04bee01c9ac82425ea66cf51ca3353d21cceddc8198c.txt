           WOMAN ADMITS SLAPPING ADOPTED CHILD ON FLIGHT FROM RUSSIA

     NEW YORK (AP) -- A Phoenix woman testified Wednesday that on a
     12-hour flight from Moscow she may have slapped one of the two
     Russian girls she and her husband adopted.
     
     Karen Thorne said she was "very frustrated" in her attempts to calm
     the young girl on the crowded jet. She said difficulties began when
     she and her husband, Richard, met the 4-year-olds at an orphanage in
     Voronezh, about 12 hours north of Moscow by train.
     
     She said one child cried frequently and the other was initially
     warm, but then became aggressive and hard to manage. She said the
     children were difficult to control on a shopping trip in Moscow and
     while waiting to board the plane to New York.
     
     Three Texas men who were on the flight with their own newly adopted
     children said they saw the Thornes hit the girls. The Thornes were
     arrested upon landing and the girls were placed in foster homes,
     first in New York and now in Arizona, where the Thornes are
     permitted supervised visits.
     
     The Thornes have been charged with assault, harassment and
     endangering the welfare of the children. The Thornes speak only
     English; the children only Russian.
