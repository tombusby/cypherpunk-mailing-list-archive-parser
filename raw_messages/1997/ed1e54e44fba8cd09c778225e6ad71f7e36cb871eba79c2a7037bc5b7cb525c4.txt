Most households in the US do have firearms, most criminals don't steal guns
they buy them from the underground. If they do steal them they sell them
pretty quickly afterward. Very few gun crimes in the US are committed with
stolen guns, or guns stolen by the possessor at the time of the shooting.

Bullshit, they have muggings and such there just like everywhere else. Are
you seriously claiming that sort of stuff doesn't happen? The schools here
in Austin don't either. Most schools in the US don't have this sort of
stuff.

The way to fight crime is to stop putting 1st time offenders, drug offenses,
non-violent crimes, etc. in jails AND to make consensual crimes non-crimes
like they ethicaly should be. We have over a million people in jail in the
US, more than any other country, the vast majority of whom shouldn't be in
jail because what they did shouldn't be a crime.
