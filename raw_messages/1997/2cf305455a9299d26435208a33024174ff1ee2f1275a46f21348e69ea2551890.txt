This week, in the Seaside Issue of Shift Control...

"We bade farewell to the snail collectors and moved 
down to the beach. The tide was out, revealing a broad 
stretch of seaweed-covered stones. At the tide's edge 
a man and a woman were harvesting winkles, "for tonight's 
tea". We continued to the next bay, half expecting to 
find someone digging for maggots or collecting slugs, 
but instead we bumped into a naked bloke. He seemed more 
surprised than us and dashed off into the sea." 
- Paul Robinson on a weekend away at the seaside.

"The good news from the English Tourist Board (ETB) is 
that the seaside amusement industry is booming: last 
year we took 18.7 million seaside holidays and spent 
£4.2bn. The coast is still the most popular domestic
holiday destination, possibly because, as Anna Crombie 
of the ETB points out, 'you can still have fun whatever 
the weather, which is not always true of our continental 
competitors'. Who needs the sun when you can visit Mr 
Blobby's Bubble Kingdom?" 
- Rebecca Fox provides the ultimate guide to British 
beaches.

"As soon as we got to the sand my father sprinted down to 
the sea, gritted his teeth and dived in. We stood there 
unimpressed, looking for the nearest café. Dad waved, 
beckoning us to join him. With the sun having just gone 
in and the wind picking up, none of us were going to comply."
- Leo Hickman on growing up at the seaside.

Plus new fiction, the story of a bionic bee and the chance 
to see your own music and movie reviews published on the net.
