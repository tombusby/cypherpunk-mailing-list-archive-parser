Gee, this sounds great!  Sounds like it would become illegal for ISPs to 
"cooperate" (aka:  getting strongarmed) by the local thugs (cops) to reveal 
information about subscribers.   Except, as is so often the case, they seem 
to always figure out ways to explain that cooperation with cops was somehow 
not covered in the law above.

One of the non-obvious dangers of having laws such as this apply to ISPs is 
that they increase the likelihood that legal force could be applied to them 
in order to get them to sell-out their customers.   And, obviously, the 
average citizen isn't going to have a lot of luck getting these laws 
ENFORCED unless he has friends in the prosecutor's office.


One of the numerous advantages of an AP-type system is that a person will be 
able to make a violation of his privacy a crime regardless of whether the 
powers-that-be agree.  Also, he can enforce that "law" on anyone, including 
government agents, without the cooperation of the prosecutor.
