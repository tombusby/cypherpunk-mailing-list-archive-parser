AN ONLINE MUSIC EXCLUSIVE!
---------------------------

We've been working with one of our favorite bands, The Verve Pipe
(http://www.musicblvd.com/cgi-bin/tw/1314_42_168858), to bring you a
special offer exclusively for online music fans. Here's what they asked
us to tell you:

"A few weeks ago we were approached with an opportunity that we loved.
We learned about a cool new technology now available from AT&T, that
brings our music directly to our fans. 

We asked for the cooperation of both our label RCA/BMG, and our
publisher EMI, to allow us to deliver a special live performance track
in its entirety. As many of you know, the Internet has been an huge
part of our ongoing communication with you.  

One of our favorite songs, "Reverend Girl", from our album "Villains",
was recorded live at the State Theater in Kalamazoo, MI. We were very
happy with the quality of the recording and performance of that night.
After a lot of thought, we chose this live track to make available to
you in its entirety -- at no cost! 

We have been assured by the folks at AT&T that the quality of the
download is as good as the original live recording, and it will only be
available for a limited time through our web site:
http://www.thevervepipe.com 

We hope you enjoy and thanks to all."
