My impression from a talk by ???, perhaps at the San Jose IETF, is
that the new version of PGP is actually coded to facilitate this kind
of interaction internally -- that is, it is designed around a general
interface philosophy of connecting filter modules via a stream
abstraction.

I think it would be a relatively straightforward, fun project to
develop a simple scripting language that could specify this.  Not knowing 
that much, I toss this out just to give the flavor of something that could 
be in a .pgprc file:

message-to:private_joe@bigco.com
	encrypt(joes_private_private_stego_key)->
	stegosaurous.gif->
	encrypt(joes_bigco_cmr_key,bigco_cmr_key)
	address-to:joe@bigco.com

message-to:joe@bigco.com
	encrypt(joes_bigco_cmr_key,bigco_cmr_key)
	address-to:joe@bigco.com

message-from:joe@bigco.com
	decrypt(*)->encrypt(my_private_storage_key)

Definitely not for version 1 of the standard.

	- GAK would be impossible to enforce.
