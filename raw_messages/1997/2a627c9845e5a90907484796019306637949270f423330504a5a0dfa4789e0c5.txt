This may be the wrong forum for this question, if so then ignore me.

I have posted this question to the folks at PGP...

In the process of creating a set of keys with PGP 5.0 Beta an Access
Violation 
took place (this is NT).  The public key was sent to keys.pgp.com but the key 
ring was not created (or was corrupted).  How does one go about getting a key 
revoked with a lost private key?

Thanks,
Phil
