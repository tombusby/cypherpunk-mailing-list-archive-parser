Unlike crypto, metaphors are easier to "decode" than "encode", so it
takes quite a bit less intellect for you to understand them than it
takes for me to make them.  But I don't see that as a "bad" thing
for you.  It's a savage, cruel world out there, and only when you
shut yourself off to it (unwittingly in your case) do you feel "good".
