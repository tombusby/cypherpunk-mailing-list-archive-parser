How about:

To sub-s-c-r-ibe to the Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer is a little different
than most mailing lists you may have experienced. The reason is that the
list consists of several indipendent systems passing traffic from each
system to the others. They use a mutualy agreed upon method for deleting
multiple copies. Since all the remailers share a commen remailer package,
namely Majordomo, they have a commen interface. The actual mechanism of
sub-scr-ip-tion is to send 'majordomo@<system>' an email with 'sub-scr-ibe
cypherpunks' in the body.

As of <insert date here> the available <system> are:

 albegra.com
 ssz.com (human mailing list help is available at list@ssz.com)
 cyberpass.net

[To avoid bias I suggest sorting alphabeticaly by domain and then system
 name]
