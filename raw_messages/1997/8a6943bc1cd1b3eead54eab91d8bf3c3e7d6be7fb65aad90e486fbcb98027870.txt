Sometimes leaving a bloody dogs head on their doorstep works, or 
putting a few rounds in the side of their car...

There are many circumstances that don't involve a circle of assholes
with drawn weapons.  Perhaps you have a job that allows you to carry a
gun; most don't.  Perhaps you drive with your weapon on your lap, and
are always on the lookout for snipers; but I doubt it.  Maybe you have
eyes in the back of your head, and can read people's minds, but I
doubt that, too.  The cold fact is, Ben, if I wanted bad enough to
kill you, you would almost certainly be dead, never knowing it
happened.  That's not magic -- you could do the same to me, and if you
gave 10 minutes thought you would realize this is so. 

All this stuff about always being on guard and being totally aware of
your surroundings is silly macho bullshit.  And even if it wasn't,
it's an braindead empty argument -- if you were always on guard and
totally aware of your surroundings you would never need a gun for
anything, anyway.

And Ben, it's not that I would rather be shot than live with the
consequences of shooting someone.  If that really were the choice I
wouldn't give it a second thought.  But that's almost never really the
choice.
