If their mailbox is full I might let it sit a day. If I still get a bounce
after that I currently yank it. As I stated earlier, I am currently trying to
decide if daily or weekly purges are in order. I personaly lean toward daily.
I certainly am not buying disk space just so somebody else can use it for
storing things they don't personaly have room for.

Hmmm, to date I haven't had a problem determining where the cause was
from the bounces I see. I can't always tell why but it always seems to
say whose email address was involved.

If you get it up and running there should be no programming involved. Unless
you want to reconfigure.
