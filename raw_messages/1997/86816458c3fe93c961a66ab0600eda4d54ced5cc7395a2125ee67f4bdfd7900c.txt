1. You must assume that any well-heeled opponent will have built a 
Wiener engine, so the time to brute a DES key can be measured in 
hours, rather than days. A ciphertext-only attack is only a little
harder than a known-plaintext attack.

But that doesn't stop us from doing the calculation anyway.

The fastest DES cracker I'm aware of (Bryddes) currently claims 
615,000 keys/sec on a Pentium 120.

The sandia machine is acheiving 1.06 Tflops with 7264 processors.
The processors are 200 MHz Pentium Pros. (The Mflop rate is lower 
than the MHz rate). They plan to have 9200 of them when it's 
finished.

615k * 200/120 = 1.025Mkps
(it'll actually be a bit higher on a Pro)

1.025M * 9200 = 9.430Gkps

(2^56 = 7.2E16)/9.43E9 = 7.6 Msec

= 88.44 days

Thats a conservative, upper limit, not a SWAG.

Speeds would be much higher on a 64 bit machine. I'm very curious to
see how bitslice DES would run on an MMX Pentium, which has some
64 bit registers.

40 bit encryption is a bad joke = it would take about 2 min on this 
machine for 40 bit DES
