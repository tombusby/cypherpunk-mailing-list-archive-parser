  Perhaps I was unclear, but I was refering to the _ancient_ notion
that once one has crawled out of the primeval swamp and begun to walk
upright, that they should work on controlling their animal passions to
the extent that they abide by the agreements they have sworn to uphold,
regardless of whether the people they are being paid to serve have
pissed them off.
  Am I mistaken in my impression that they did not take over Intel's
factory? How is your mind holding up, Tim? Can you remember details
of your life that don't have to do with Intel?

  Do you know about some 'deal' of which I am not aware in this
situation
or shall we discuss the _real_ events which took place in Humboldt?

  To tell the truth, I really don't have any problem with _you_ doing
so. I _would_ have a problem with the cops doing so, however, which is
a point I am trying to make.
  It may be the policeman's job and/or duty to arrest and imprison the
people involved, but it is in no way their duty or right to _punish_
the people by invoking a level of violence which is not necessary to
accomplish the job.
  I don't really care if it is _difficult_ for the policemen to deal
with the physical details of imprisoning the people. And I don't have
a lot of sympathy for the protesters if they get bumped and bruised
in the process of the police honestly doing their job. However, it
is unconscienable for officers to inflict pain and suffering on 
the protesters for no other reason than to punish them for making
the policeman's job difficult and defying authority.

  Such as dumping tea in Boston harbor to protest oppressive
taxation?

  Fucking eh! I wish you had been in charge back then. I thought it
was ridiculous for LEA's to play to protesters desires by escalating
situations beyond what was really needed because of some perceived
threat to their authority.

  Say, that's not a 'red bandana' on your neck, is it?
