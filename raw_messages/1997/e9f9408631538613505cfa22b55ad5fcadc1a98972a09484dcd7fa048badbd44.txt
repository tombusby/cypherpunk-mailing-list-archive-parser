the problem with spamford is that many sites ignore everything (IP packets,
email messages, and so on) that comes from there.

algebra.com, for example, ignores all email from cyberpromo and all
affiliated domains.

If i discover that there is something useful taht comes out of there, *i*
may fine tune my setup, but do not hope that other sites will be as nice.
