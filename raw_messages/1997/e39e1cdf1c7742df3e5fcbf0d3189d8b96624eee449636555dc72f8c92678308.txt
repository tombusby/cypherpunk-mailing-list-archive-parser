C2 employees informally mentioned libel suits to several cypherpunks,
such as Tim May.  Given that a good percentage of the company, perhaps
a majority, was involved with this incident, it seems reasonable to
judge the character of the company based on these actions.

This incident changed my view of C2 considerably.  Initially I held
them in the highest regard.  No longer.

(Your employment by C2 should have been mentioned in your post.  Many
people on the list may not know about it.  It is relevant.)
