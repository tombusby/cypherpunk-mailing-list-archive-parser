Subject: Wimsey cryptography archive is moving to Mindlink

The Wimsey cryptography archive at ftp://ftp.wimsey.com/pub/crypto is moving
to MIND LINK (http://www.mindlink.net). 

You can now access the contents of the cryptography archive at its new location
ftp://ftp.mindlink.net/pub/crypto

The archive has been at Wimsey for about five years. I'd like to thank
the folks at Wimsey for providing disk space, bandwidth, technical
expertise, and for supporting the distribution of ~140MB of cryptography 
papers and software on the Internet.

As with Wimsey, MIND LINK is providing disk space and bandwidth 
for the archive at no charge to me or the users of the archive.
Thanks should go to MIND LINK for providing this as a service to
the Internet community.

Two small notes:
1. I assume sole responsibility for the contents of the archive. The
   folks at MIND LINK are generously providing facilties at no charge
   above their usual access fees, but they are not necessarily even 
   aware of the exact contents of the archive. My only connection with 
   MIND LINK is as a customer. 

2. Please do not attempt to use the MIND LINK crypto archive to violate
   the laws of the U.S. or Canada. Distribution of cryptographic software
   is limited to U.S./Canadian persons in the U.S./Canada. All access to 
   the site is logged.

Any problems or questions? Please feel free to contact me at
