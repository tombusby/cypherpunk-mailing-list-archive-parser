  Kookie Roberts is just another in a long line of parents who
seem to think that control over their children's development
is the responsibility of someone other than themselves.
  I have a wonderful idea. How about if those parents who don't
want to assume responsibility for control over their children's
lives pass custody of them to someone who will assume that
responsibility, instead of arguing that everyone else's rights
must be abridged because they are busy doing other things.

  I, for one, don't want to be forced to live in Kookie's world
just because she is too busy being busy and important to properly
supervise her children.
