Hi,

While the list is busy knocking PGP for not doing the "right thing" or
being the "first ones to blink" I though I would share with the list what
some of the "big boys" are doing for the spread of "Strong Crypto to the
Masses". Below is from the most current S/MIME draft
"draft-dusse-smime-msg-05" dated 19-Oct-1997:

2.6 ContentEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier

Receiving agents MUST support decryption using the RC2 [RC2] or a
compatible algorithm at a key size of 40 bits, hereinafter called
"RC2/40". Receiving agents SHOULD support decryption using DES EDE3 CBC,
hereinafter called "tripleDES" [3DES] [DES].

Sending agents SHOULD support encryption with RC2/40 and tripleDES.

I think that when taking pot-shots at PGP, Inc. and Phil Zimmerman one
should look at what the alternatives are and who are really are friends
here. IMNSHO companies like RSA, Netscape, Microsoft, Verisign, et al, who
would sell us all out if it improved their bottom lines do not qualify.
