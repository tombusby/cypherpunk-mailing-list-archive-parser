Why?  Each hop adds value to the message (in this case, increased
anonymity/security).  Shouldn't a person have to pay more for increased
value? 

Also, how would a user pay per-month to each remailer and maintain total
anonymity and ease of use.  Flat rate pricing requires one to open an
"account" with each remailer he would ever use before sending the first
message.  Then at each hop, the message is linked to some "account" on the
server which is someway linked to the user (specifically, a set of messages
going through a server can be linked to the same "account", which to me is
totally unacceptable).  This seems overly complicated and could compromise
the users anonymity.

Finally, with flat rate, what would prevent a person from spamming?

For me, the main problems I see are the number of remailers available and
spam prevention.  Going commercial solves these problems.  Also, there will
still be free remailers around.

Agreed.  I've just finished going through the Eudora API docs and I think
sending a message through remailers can be as easy as clicking one button
on the toolbar (just like with signing a messages with the pgp plugin).
For everyday use, everything else (like choosing the remailer chain) can be
automated.
