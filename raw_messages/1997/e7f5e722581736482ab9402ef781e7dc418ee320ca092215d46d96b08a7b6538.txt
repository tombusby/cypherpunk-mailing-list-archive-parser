That analogy is faulty.  The issue is the (claimed) need to provide an 
e-mail address when communicating via usenet, or some other public forum.  
Since the chosen communications medium is usenet (or a public mailing list like 
this), you can reply to me via that same medium.  An e-mail address is only 
required if I want E-MAIL replies in response to my post.  So, in that 
regard, a telephone number would fall into the same category.  I'd only 
feel obliged to include a phone number in my posts if I wanted people to 
contact me via TELEPHONE.

Sending anonymous e-mail to a person is more analogous to sending snail mail
without a return address.  It would be a form of one-way communications, unlike
an anonymous PUBLIC post where a public reply is still possible.  If you want 
to use the telephone analogy, then what you're talking about is
akin to a pay phone that's not traceable back to an individual.  ANI or
caller ID would show the number of the pay phone itself, just like anonymous
e-mail from a remailer shows the return address of the remailer rather than the
sender.  (For the majority of internet users, calling someone anonymously on
a payphone is probably simpler than figuring out how to use a remailer, so the
convenience of being able to call anonymously FROM HOME is not really
required.)

BTW, while this post does contain a replyable e-mail address, I'm not
soliciting e-mail replies and I can't even guarantee that a reply to my return
address would reach me, due to the uncertainty of 'nym reply blocks these
days.  For all anyone knows, all return e-mail could be forwarded to
/dev/null@somewhere.

Exactly.  And yet many on usenet would deny that same CONVENIENCE to anonymous
usenet posters.  Sure, anonymous posting can be "abused" just as people can
conceal illegal weapons under their clothing.  But the answer to that is not to 
require public nudity just to protect against "clothing abuse".  I guess a
better analogy would be a nudist colony where both nudity and clothing are
acceptable.  And the de facto censors of anonymous posts would turn Usenet into
a nudist colony where clothing was FORBIDDEN, or at least where the wearers of
clothing were ridiculed and insulted.

As I'd tell someone (if I were posting anonymously) "you go first". <g>  A
couple of times an anonymous poster has offered "if you want my e-mail
address, give me your home phone number and I'll phone you and give it to you".
Strange, but I've never seen such an offer accepted.  <g>
