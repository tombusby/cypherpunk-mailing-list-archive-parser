Yep. Chemical Biological Weapons (CBW), the choice of many future
terrorists and assassins, can now be produced by anyone with a solid
background in organic chemistry or microbiology and a relatively modest
amount of funding (< USD 10,000).

Delivery can be by any number of means, including: static (e.g., planted at
a location in wait for the target and remotely triggered, for example by a
pager. Cost less than USD 500) or dynamic (e.g., a small remotely piloted
or autonomous aircraft, for example, a modified giant-scale RC plane.  Cost
less than USD 3000 if remotely controlled, USD 5000-10,000 if autonomous
using DGPS guidance).  EE experience is assumed.

If the assassin is unconcerned with collateral damage his success depends
only on knowing where his target will be and when.  Since CBW agents can
have a considerable kill zone there is no need for 'crosshair' accuracy.
