None of them are considered "accepted cancellers" by me.

If your news server processes cancels, then it processes the cancels forged by
this scum whether or not you consider them "accepted cancellers".

You seem to imply that there's a choice whose forged cancels to process, which
is not true in general (unless one aliases out the site used to forge
cancels).

You also lied when you claimed that Jan Isley only forges cancels for articles
cross-posted in "his" local alt.* hierarchy, Ehud Gavron only forges cancels
for cross-posts in "his" az.*, etc - not that this would have been an excuse,
but all of these scumbags have been caught forging cancels for articles posted
only in unmoderated "big 6" newsgroups once, as documented on their respective
Net.Scum pages.

Fact 1: Tim Skirvin, his friends, and and their "rules" are irrelevant,
impotent, isolated, and ignored.

> 	Tim Brown broke the rules blatantly.

Fact 2: Tim Brown, Jan Isley, Chris Lewes, Bob Curtis, Ehud Gavron, and the
rest of the self-appointed "spam cancellers" break the rule that says you
should forge cancels for articles you didn't post. As for _your_ rules, see
Fact 1 above.

Anyone can compare David Stodolsky's "Cancel FAQ" with Tim Skirvin's "Cancel
FAQ" and verify that substantial portions (most of the technical discussion on
how cancels work; the discussion of why people issue cancels; et al) have been
copied without attribution. (Tim Skirvin also flames Stodolsky in his FAQ.)
