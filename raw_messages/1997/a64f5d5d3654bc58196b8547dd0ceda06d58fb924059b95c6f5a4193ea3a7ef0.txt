BTW, did you hear about the blonde who walked into a bar with a headset
on? The bartender said, "Take them off, you can't wear those in here." She
replied that she couldn't whereupon the bartender ripped them off her. She
collapsed immediately and was dead by the time the Rescue Squad arrived.
This happened three days in a row with different blonds. Finally, the
bartender picked up the headphones and listened. He heard "Breathe In.
Breathe Out. Breathe IN. Breath Out."
