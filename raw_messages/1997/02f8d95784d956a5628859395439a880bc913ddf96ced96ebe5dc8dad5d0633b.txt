Not everyone has "bailed out".  Amid the flotsam and jetsam of the sinking
list, Igor Chudov Firebeard, and others have begun to fashion a trimaran.
If they finish before the old vessel finally sinks in the storm, then we
will have a ship more difficult to capsize.  Others are anchoring that half
finished craft to the great floating city/state Usenet.  Still others are
scheming as to the best way to keep the self appointed police from cutting
the little craft adrift.

No, we would have "bailed out" if we had each sit still to let our
subscriptions run out.  More will "go down with the ship", arguing against
the shutdown right up to the day when the list is finally eliminated.
