On 1/18/97, I sent freedom of information act requests to the FBI (main and
San Francisco offices), CIA, NSA, and Secret Service, asking them for copies
of information in their files relating to or referring to the cypherpunks
list, the cypherpunks meetings, and copies of any messages sent from or to
"cypherpunks@toad.com".

To date, I have received three responses: one from the SF office of the FBI,
indicating that they have no records responsive to my request; one from the
NSA, indicating that they are processing my request, and one from the Secret
Service, asking for a copy of my signature. (I've got no clue why they want
that; unless I screwed up, I believe my initial request was signed.) 

Copies of my requests and the responses are available online at
<http://www.io.com/~gbroiles/cp-foia/>.

I'm not sure what I think about the response from the SF FBI branch - it
seems unlikely that they'd never have paid any attention to the list, given
the media coverage in Wired and other places. On the other hand, maybe the
FBI doesn't read Wired. :) While they're not supposed to be monitoring
noncriminal domestic activity, I figured they'd at least have something about
the Mykotronix stuff.
