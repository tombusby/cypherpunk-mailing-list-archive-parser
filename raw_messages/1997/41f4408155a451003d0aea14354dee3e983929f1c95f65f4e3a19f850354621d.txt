An arbitrary Real can be constructed from the Rationals. If we accept the
proposition, as posed apparently by you and others, of uncountable Reals then
your 'assumption' fails, otherwise the 'uncountable' members would be
countable.

A 'limit point' is not the same as 'equal to'. Arbitrarily close is not
equivalent, inherent in the definition of a limit point is the concept of
'little o' and 'big o', or worded differently our axiomatic definition of
infinity.

We can, but there is no fundamental rule in mathematics that requires me to
ignore the small but distinct difference between the element in the original
set and the sequences used to approximate it. It is something that must be
agreed upon by accepting a particular axiomatic definition of infinity.

The number of cuts are 1-to-1 with the Reals, they are not the Reals.
There is no way I can make a cut which is 3.1527, only 1-to-1 with the
number(s). Important distinction.
