I have been thinking about this for days now. They are using the same tired
four horsemen stories they used in 1992. They need something new. 
Something fresh.  Something that conveniently makes the news the week
before the vote.

Somehow I sense they need an event a bit more photogenic than an
indictment. Of course the would prefer bodies. Nothing works stronger PR
magic than bodies of dead children. Then again, perhaps some footage of
the rifles impounded from the Crypto Militia, as the press releases will
call the group, might suffice. Together, perhaps with the corpse of one of
their "leaders".

There are two main reasons why there might be no trial: they drop the 
charges or there is no defendant left alive to be put on trial...
