"New Crypto Engines From Trusted Information Systems Allow Easy
International Use of Strong Encryption "

  By supporting any application that calls for the use of algorithms such 
  as DES, Triple-DES, or 128-bit RC2 or RC4, "this product will allow 
  Windows users to use encryption as easily as they use a mouse. 
  Previously, if developers wanted to use encryption in their products, they 
  had to consider writing two different versions, dealing with changing 
  export regulations, and so on. Now, they can write one version of the 
  program and sell it worldwide, knowing that the CSP will handle the 
  encryption legally and safely."

"Two Companies Set to Offer Key Recovery Services Using Technology
from TIS "

  SourceKey and Data Securities International (DSI) have applied
  for approval to operate Key Recovery Centers to support
  exported encryption products. TIS also announced today that it is in 
  negotiations with  the National Computing Centre, Ltd. of the U.K. and 
  Philips Crypto BV of the Netherlands to license the first non-U.S.-based 
  Key Recovery Centers for third party use.

"Burns Prepares To Reintroduce Encryption Bill"

  "This time around," Burns said, "we intend to put a bill on the
  President's desk and find out if he is truly on the side of the
  users and providers of rapidly expanding high-tech goods and
  services." It would prohibit a mandatory system under which
 producers or users of hardware and software would be required
 to surrender a decoding "key" to a third party.
