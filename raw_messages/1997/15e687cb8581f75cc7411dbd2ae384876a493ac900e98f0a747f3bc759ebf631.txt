Congratulations! This is the longest symmetric key ever brute forced
in public.

Now, onto cracking DES, which is probably easier than 56 bit RC5.
I have NT/Win95/(portable C) code and executables available to 
US/Canadian citizens in the US/Canada.

If you want a copy (I'm up to version 0.6, a late beta), then
send ptrei@acm.org your: 

1. Real name and residence address.
2. A statement that you are aware of and will abide by the 
   US/Canadian export regulations.
3. A statement that you are a US/Canadian citizen, or a US 
   Green Card holder.
4. The email address to which to send the software.

I will hold this information in confidence.
