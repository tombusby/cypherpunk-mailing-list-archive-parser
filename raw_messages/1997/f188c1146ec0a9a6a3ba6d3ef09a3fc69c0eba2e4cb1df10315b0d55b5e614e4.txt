                   POLL: YOUNG ADULTS WANT BETTER GOVERNMENT

     WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most young adults don't necessarily want to
     reduce government's role in America but want it to do a better job,
     according to a new poll. As for themselves, however, they see their
     future not in government work but in private business.
     
     The survey by pollsters Peter Hart and Robert Teeter was released
     Wednesday at the kickoff of a project by corporations and nonprofit
     groups to increase public trust in government.
     
     In the poll, 40 percent of respondents said government can help them
     achieve their goals in life, compared with the 48 percent who said
     government programs and policies are a hindrance.
     
     But a large majority, 71 percent, answered that government could
     help with better leadership and management, and 60 percent would
     prefer improving the government over simply reducing its size and
     power.
     
     On working in government themselves, 66 percent said a career in the
     private sector is more appealing. The telephone survey of 505
     Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 was conducted October 29 and
     30. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
