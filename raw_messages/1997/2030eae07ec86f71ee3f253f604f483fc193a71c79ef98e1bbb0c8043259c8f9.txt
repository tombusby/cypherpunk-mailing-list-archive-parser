I didn't find out about the Japaneese concentration camps until after I saw
the karate kid and had it explained to me.  As I had most of my high school
career ahead of me at the time, that much info should have made me aware of
the lessons covering them in my various high school history classes.  Nearly
every history class I have had has either stopped sometime around the end of
the civil war, stayed in Oklahoma, stopped around WWI with the United States
held as the hero of the event, or glossed over the entire Japaneese
concentration camp story.
And I thought my teachers were fairly open minded.
And we fault the Germans and Japaneese for not owning up to thier wartime
misdeeds.

Incidently, I didn't know that many Jews were turned away from the united
states borders during WWII either until an article came out about it in one
of the weeklies.
