On 10/31/97 12:46 PM, Tim May (tcmay@got.net)  passed this wisdom:

 This is one (of many) things my ex-wife and I used to disagree on ... 
she would want to haul the kid or herself off to the Emergency room 
everytime anything happened ... the idea of sleeping on it and seeing how 
it seemed in the morning was foreign to her; I can see that broken limbs 
getting sharp raps in head etc ... but every little sniffle ... of course 
premiums are up. For us, it was zero co-pay since between my retired 
military status and back then Raytheon medical coverage I never had to 
lay out a penny, when its that free eats easy to over-indulge ... and 
during those times I spent in the ER waiting room I saw many other doing 
the same thing.
