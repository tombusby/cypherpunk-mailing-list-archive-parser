An interesting idea.  However, while there is no doubt some truth to 
it, I think you are vastly overestimating the strength of the 
effect.  The barriers between cliques are quite permeable, and there 
are many people who have cross membership in several.  So no 
significant good idea is going to be blocked.

A far more important form of filtering takes place inside the cranium. 
Human beings find it essentially impossible to accept ideas from
people they consider assholes, even if they "read" every word.

I think you are vastly overrating the impact of "spooks" and "shills" 
on the operation of this list.  It seems to proceed by its own dynamic.
