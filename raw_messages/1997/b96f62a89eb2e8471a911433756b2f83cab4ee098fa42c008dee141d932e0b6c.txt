Thanks for critiquing this sensitive topic.

The 11-page paper was published by Radiation 
Research, as noted here, whose editor is at Oak
Ridge National Lab, if that offers credibility.

Radiation Research's Web site shows an impressive
range of credentials of scientists in the field, perhaps 
superior, if more specialized, to that of Science and 
Nature, both which oft times suffers the chancres of
promiscuous sci-populuxitis.

Best is to see the report for oneself. A copy is available 
for US$30.00 by fax. Request by calling the publisher 
at (423) 574-5874. Or E-mail to:

   Biology Division

We've had a layman's look and cite the authors' final
cautionary paragraph:

"This is not to imply that any humans at all are necessarily
at increased risk of cancer as a consequence of exposure 
to RF fields. No single experiment on animals can allow such
a conclusion. Rather, we believe the study reported here
indicates a need for further research. Tumorigenesis in
genetically predisposed mice may provide a useful assay
for interactions between RF fields and biological systems. 
With the current rapid expansion in the use of RF fields
for telecommunications, a reliable assay is required to
enable a better assessment of limits to safe levels of
human exposure."

Send more money or die, sucker, the "responsible" scientist's 
clanging alarm, eh?
