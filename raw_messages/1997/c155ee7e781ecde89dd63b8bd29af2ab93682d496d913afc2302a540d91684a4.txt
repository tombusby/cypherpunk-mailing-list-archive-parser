I don't doubt that... but when they get zero orders because _noone_
has a SET wallet much less SET certs for their cards, that decision
will get re-evaluated pretty quickly (I would think). If the consumer 
has to get out of their chair to use SET, it's dead. And they have to 
do considerably more than that IMO.

The infrastructure required for SET to actually be used is outrageous,
especially for the consumer. All IMHO of course.

True enough...
