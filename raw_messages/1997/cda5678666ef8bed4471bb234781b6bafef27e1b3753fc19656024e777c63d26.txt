>"Secret Power" by Nicki Hagar 
>The International Spying Networks UKUSA and ECHELON
>301pp ISBN: 0-908802-35-8 
>
>According to this remarkable book, that has somehow escaped the flames of
>book banners crying "national security," the United States NSA and the
>United Kingdom's GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) operate a
>global spying network called UKUSA. To listen in on conversations across the
>planet, a massive eavesdropping apparatus was built, with tentacles which
>reach into dozens of different countries beyond the shores of either the US
>or UK as well as across the skies.
>
>Describing the nature of UKUSA, its global affiliations, and operations
>represents a huge effort on the part of author Nicki Hager. He states early
>on in 'Secret Power':
>
>  "Many people are vaguely aware that a lot of spying occurs, maybe even on
>  them, but how do we judge if it is ubiquitous or not a worry at all? Is
>  someone listening every time we pick up the telephone? Are all of our
>  Internet or fax messages being pored over continuously by shadowy figures
>  somewhere in a windowless building?
>
>  "What follows explains as precisely as possible - and for the first time
>  in public - how the worldwide [spy] system works, just how immense and
>  powerful it is and what it can and cannot do.
>
>  "The global system has a highly secret codename: ECHELON."
>
>And that is the foundation of a tremendous amount of research that describes
>in detail how the vast global spying network "collects all the telephone
>calls, faxes, telexes, Internet messages and other electronic communications
>that its computers have been pre-programmed to select," and then analyzes
>the contents and distributes it to members UKUSA and ECHELON partners
>world-wide.
>
>The operational details of how the US (NSA), UK (GCHQ), Canada (CSE),
>Australia (DSD) and New Zealand (GCSB) intercepts signals, throws high power
>computing behind ECHELON 'KeyWord' dictionary attacks and what they do with
>that information is potentially alarming; especially since so much of this
>decades old practice has been kept under the wraps of security.
>
>Secret Power names the names, provides the dates and the technical details
>on the world's largest, best financed and coordinated global spying
>apparatus ever conceived. Full of pictures, maps and charts, the reader will
>get a complete picture of just how much effort and resources go into
>international security, long distance eavesdropping, and spying.
>
>>From the Cold War to today, UKUSA and ECHELON have been fascinating and
>powerful intelligence functions to spy both on enemies and friends. "Secret
>Power" provides the first peek inside the world's most secretive and
>powerful electronic spy organization.
>
>"Secret Power" reads like a thriller, except that it's true. It should be
>read by everyone with an interest in intelligence, espionage and the
>technology that modern spies use.
>
>"An astonishing number of people have told him [author Nicki Hager] things
>that I, as Prime Minister in charge of the intelligence services, was never
>told...It is an outrage that I and other ministers were told so little."
>        -David Lange, Prime Minister of New Zealand 1984-89 
>
>"...the most detailed and up to date account of the work of any signals
>intelligence agency in existence. It is a masterpiece of investigative
>reporting, and provides a wealth of information."
>        -Jeffrey T. Richelson, leading authority on United States
>intelligence agencies and author of America's Secret Eyes in the Sky, and
>co-author of 'The Ties that Bind.'
