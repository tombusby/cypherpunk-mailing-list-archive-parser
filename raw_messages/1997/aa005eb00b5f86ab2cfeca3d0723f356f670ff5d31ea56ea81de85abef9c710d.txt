>    Austria goes Offline
>    ====================
>
>    On Tuesday, 25.3.1997, Austria's ISPs are going to shutdown all their
>    Internet services from 16:00 to 18:00 MET.  The reason for this unique
>    action is the recent seize of all computer equipment of a Viennese ISP
>    by the police as pieces of evidence.  This official act was triggered by
>    a denunciation versus persons unknown regarding child pornography dating
>    10.3.1996 (! one year ago !).
>
>    Confiscation of equipment after more than one year doesn't seem to be
>    appropriate for securing evidence.  The current legal status doesn't
>    clearly define the position of an ISP and doesn't specify general
>    guidelines for the responsibility of content of the Internet.  With the
>    general shutdown Austria's ISPs are demonstrating the only mode of
>    operation which is evidently conforming to current law.
>
>    Apart from the existing willingness for co-operation Austria's ISPs are,
>    at the same time, offering practical support for the legal authority
>    like free Internet access and training for their staff.
