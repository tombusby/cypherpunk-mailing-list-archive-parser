Is there any legal standing for a PGP signature?  I'm tired of my
luser customers faxing me legal documents, then expecting me to sign
it and fax it back.  Yeah, right, like photoshop can't cut-n-paste.
I've got a fax modem on my Linux box, so I'm going to start (in fact
have started) uuencoding the .g3 file, indicating my assent, and
emailing it back to them.
