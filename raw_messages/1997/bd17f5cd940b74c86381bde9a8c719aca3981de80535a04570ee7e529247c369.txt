While I am not fond of Feinstein for various reasons, there is no
contradiction whatsoever in someone carrying a gun, and also working
to outlaw them.  You deal with the realities of the world, and try to
make them better.  It would be a contradiction only if she succeeded
in outlawing them, and continued to carry one. 

She is no more hypocritical than "anarchists" who continue to milk 
the state and society in which they live.
