You consider use by students at U.C.Berkeley to be use by a "government
agency or organization".  I don't think that is what is meant.  They mean
something like the NSA, or Congress, or the military.

It would be better if they explicitly explained how public schools
were to be dealt with.  My guess would be that instructors and staff
members would require a license, but that students could use it for free.
Probably the best thing to do is to send email to PGP and ask them to
issue a clarification.

"Within" is probably meant in the organizational sense, not in terms of
physical inclusion.  The fundamental point is whether revenue generation
is involved.  Personal email does not generate revenue (arguably reading
your personal email at work interferes with generating revenue).

You can't use it to do your work.  Your company should buy a copy in
that case.  Reading your work email counts as part of doing your work.

Mostly these seem like reasonable definitions of non-commercial use.
But you have identified some gray areas that should be fleshed out.
