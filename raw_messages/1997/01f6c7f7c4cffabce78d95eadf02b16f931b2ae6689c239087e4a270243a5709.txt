This is becoming all too common (cf. online reports, and some good t.v.
investigative shows which detailed how this shakedown operation works in
many states).

As to the question above, "2.  What the hell legit reason is there for a
man to be driving around with * >132 K in a truck??," this shows the dire
state we are in today.

After all, what the hell business is it of government/police to tell a
person what they may do with their money? If I want to push my money around
in a wheel barrow, it may be stupid, but if cops seize it then they are
just thieves, plain and simple.

(Arguments that the money "must have" been stolen, or to be used for an
illegal transaction, or whatever, are meaningless. Unless the money can be
shown to be stolen, or unless the person being stopped is actually shown to
be in an illegal transaction (not that I support such laws, mind you), the
cops can do nothing.)

However, cash is on the way toward being outlawed. De facto, if not de jure.
