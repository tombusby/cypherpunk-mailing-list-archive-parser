The DC cypherpunk working meeting and Diffie-Hellman patent expiration
party is this Saturday, September 6. About 30 people have RSVP'd. Speakers
include Bob Corn-Revere, a member of the Bernstein legal team, who will
talk about the lawsuit.

A group of 2600ers from NYC are coming down and may be able to bring
friends. People also plan to come from Baltimore and Richmond, so
carpooling might be a possibility. Email me for more info on this.

Remember, the event has two portions:

  -- 5:30 pm: a DCCP working meeting and potluck supper.
  -- 8:00 pm: a post-meeting party to celebrate the expiration of the
              Diffie-Hellman and Merkle-Hellman patents.
