I've been using the _text_ form, as the Children's Decency and Safety Act
of 1997 requires that _all_ electronic communications potentially viewable
by those affected (children, the mentally disable, homos, Muslims, etc.,
any of whom might be offended) be appropriately rated and labelled with the
voluntary self-rating system (can be found at
http://www.bigbro.gov/ratingsv01.html).

This mandatory voluntary system meets the needs of us all. Ignorance is
freedom, voluntary means mandatory.
