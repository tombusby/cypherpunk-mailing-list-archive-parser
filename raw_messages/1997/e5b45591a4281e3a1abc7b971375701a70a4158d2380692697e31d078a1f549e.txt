I much prefer the plan where a potential mail correspondant includes an
e-cash dollar directly cashable by me.  If I like the mail (and the
sender), I throw the dollar away and the sender goes on the approved
list.  If not, I keep the dollar, and the sender goes on the twit list.
Paper junk mail costs an advertiser more than $1 per piece, so they'd
still be getting a bargain.  And potentially, some receivers may throw
away the dollar and welcome the spam.

It should also spur development of intelligent agents which can retrieve
this cash without human intervention.  Spammers will doubtless alter
their pages to require more interaction to find the key to the cash.
Then the IA's will be improved.  Then... remember the copy protection
wars?  This isn't necessarily a negative point.

Or that the money wasn't there in the first place (absent a trusted
signature system), or the key doesn't exist, or the wrong key is
offered, or the sender put the same e-dollar on all 60000 mails sie
sent and it's already been redeemed.
