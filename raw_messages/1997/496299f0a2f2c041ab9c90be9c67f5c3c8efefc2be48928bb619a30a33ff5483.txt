Hi!

(wow, what a distribution. I should mention that des-challenge is down
this weekend, so the response may not be as expected.)

The client reports the key to the server, not to the user (very
simple, and very simple ways to get around of course). In a nutshell:
we can't enforce it, at least I can't see a way to do so. We certainly
can't keep people from doing their own "treasure hunt".

Indeed--that's what we try to avoid. Our project is not a race for
money, it is a demonstration with a political impact.

The main point in favour of a coordinated search is the availability
of progress reports. Nobody can argue that the key was found by
chance--as there is exact data about performance and the expected
maximum duration for the search.

This is a technical problem which is discussed at the moment. The
keyspace will not be publically announced (and it wasn't during the
last project).
