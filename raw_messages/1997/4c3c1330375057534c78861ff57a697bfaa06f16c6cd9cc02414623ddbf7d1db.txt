Well, that is bullshit, and that person needs to be stopped.  Anyone
trying to get more restrictive policies needs weeded out and
identified, and then dealt with.

Just who is getting harassed over this.  All you need to do is get me
the names and phone numbers, and we will eliminate this problem
immediately.

No, do not do it in this list, but respond by a private response
to this address.  This is a place you can trust.

yes it did.  But why the fuck do you not want to find out who did
this to you?  I mean, Jesus fucking CHRIST!  Let's get some fucking
balls here.  You can not let that mothetfucker get away with that!

All you need is telephone numbers for some VERY nice phone calls.
Learn to use your voice and not just your keyboard.
