Kevin Miller, a talk show host in Cleveland, is going to have me on his
local radio show at 3PM EST today to talk about e$, geodesic
markets/societies, strong crypto, digital bearer securities, and anything
else I can dream up. :-).

For those of you in Cleveland, the radio station is WERE, and I don't know
whether it's AM or FM.

Evidently, he also has a national radio show, with a simulcast (? could be
a tape to realaudio thing, though) on the net. I'm going to be on *that*,
also live, at 8PM tomorrow night.

More details as I know them.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
