Yes, if "equal opportunities" was a reality then the wealth of your family
would not be an aid nor would the destitution of your family be a
hinderance.  This, of course, is the stuff of socialism.  I suspect that
even if inheritance was banned those from wealthy and connected parents
would see some significant benefit, but probably not as much as those from
families in which good work ethic, self-reliance, savings and investment
were stressed.
