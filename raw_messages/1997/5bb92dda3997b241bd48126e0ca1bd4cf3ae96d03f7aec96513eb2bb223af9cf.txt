I know you are busy, but this is important, Can You Spare 6 Minutes?

For years, we have heard about environmental problems facing the planet.

We talk about saving the rivers, the ocean, the whales, the rain forests and the ozone.

They are all important.

But, candidly, they seem far away... beyond our personal control.

Recently I was surprised to learn of the worst environmental hazard 
in my life.  It was a serious threat to me and my family.

It was not far away.  It was in my home!

Fortunately, I am able to fix it, so can you!
 
I solved an insidious health threat to my family. 

If your home is typical, you may have the same problem.

The good news is that you can easily fix it, while saving money!
