All those things help, but Eric Hughes and Raph Levien are doing some work
that looks like it's possible to do traffic analysis as long as you can
tell when messages begin and end.  I don't know if their analysis depends on
the fact that messages get smaller as they go through the remailer chain,
or whether it will also affect Mixmaster-style remailers, which split their
messages into constant-sized blocks and mix blocks from different messages.

Some things that could be done include having each remailer add 
random-sized padding and re-encrypting before sending to another remailer,
but once you get into that level of work it probably makes sense just to
switch to Mixmaster for most uses.

				Thanks!
