Fingerprint escrow?

Does this mean that, ipso facto (I love it), physically challenged
individuals with missing or deformed hands are excluded regardless of other
qualifications? What a monstrosity of a rule!

Was this carried over the wire? AP?

The fact that Irene Mortensen has citizenship at all proves her point.

Is it not possible to retroactively _remove_ the citizenship of such an
arrogant bureaucrat to test whether she could make the grade imposed on the
rest of the world's "refuse?"

"Dear Irene Mortensen:

We regret to inform you....."

Thanks, Mike, for the increase in BP.
