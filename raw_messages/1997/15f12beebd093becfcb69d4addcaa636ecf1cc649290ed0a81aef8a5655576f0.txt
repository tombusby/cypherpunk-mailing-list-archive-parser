The Klinton Klan has already effectively banned imported SKS ammo (7.62x29,
as I recall, given that I don't have any rifles chambering this popular
round).

Those with any sense are racing to stock up before a Full Ban is enacted
(via Executive Order, the easiers form of enactment of laws in these
post-constitutional years).

So many targets, so little time.
