Why is it that people on a moral high-horse always seem to think that
that those are 'pearls of wisdom' dropping from their horse's hind-end?

  Sounds like shit-for-brains is about to launch another character
assault in the name of truth, righteousness and good dental hygene.

  As opposed to your own vicious, hateful, 'moral' rants against 
vicious, hateful, 'immoral' rants?

  Are you a kindergarten teacher? Do you have a chart where you are
placing different colored stars beside the list members names?
 
> We all agree with freedom of speech. 

  No we don't. Shut the fuck up!

> But this does not mean that all speech is equally valid.

  Did you take a statement that had meaning and edit it to come
up with this one?
  Time flies like an arrow--fruit flies like a banana.
  OK, _your_ turn again...

  CypherPunks are intelligent enough to realize that calls for violence
and murder, like the acts themselves, do not need justification.
  Didn't your parents teach you that the justification for everything
is, "Because I said so!"?

  You seem to have a desperate need to explain to the rest of the list
readers exactly what it is they are reading and what it means. You must
be a lot of fun to go to a movie with.

  Give it a fucking break...
  If you are going to piss on someone on this list, please make an
effort to do a decent job of it. Lame, smarmy character assassinations
such as yours only serve to accentuate your envy of others for their
ability to exercise their vicious, hateful nature more potently than
yourself.

  Go give your morality speeches to your kindergarten class while you
play with their little bums.
