Chemical Mace(r),
A trademark for a mixture of organic chemicals used in aerosol form as a
weapon
to disable with intense burning pain, blepharospasm, acute bronchitis,
and
respiratory irritation.
                   -- "American Heritage Dictionary", 1991

  i.e. - The police in Humboldt county used 'weapons' against peaceful
passive-resisters.

Mace is an aerosol weapon (tear gas) that is used to disable violent
attackers.

  i.e. - ibid.

What Is Mace Made Of? (Formulations)
     CN (Original Mace) 
     CS 
     CN/OC Blend 
     CS/OC Blend 
     OC 5.5% 
     OC 10% 
     OC Foam 
CN -- Chloracetophenone (Lacrimator Agent)
     Relatively toxic
     Fast Acting (Upper Respiratory Tract, Lachrymatory, Eyes) 
     Irritating to the Skin (burning and itching sensation) 
CS -- Orthochlorbenzalmalononitrle (Lacrimator Agent)
Extreme burning of the eyes, and flowing tears 
     Stinging sensation on all moist skin 
     Tightness in the chest and throat (Lung and Bronchial Irritant) 
OC -- Oleoresin of Capsicum (Inflammation Agent)
     Severe involuntary closing of the eyes/Spasms of Eyelids 
     Severe burning of the eyes, and flowing tears 
     Intense pain on all exposed all skin 

  i.e. - The police *sentenced* unconvicted citizens to receive
the *punishment* of *severe* burning and *intense* pain by use
of *chemical warfare*.

How Does It Work?
CN and CS are both irritants and lacrimator agents...if it gets 
into the respiratory tract is causes severe coughing and choking. 
                                     ^^^^^^
For CN and CS to work effectively the person being sprayed must 
be able to feel pain
                ^^^^
OC on the other hand is a inflammation agent...it causes...the 
entire respiratory system to seize up and go into spasms.

  i.e. - Severe Pain and Spasms == Punishment

Legalities
Any time you use Mace (or any kind of weapon) be prepared to 
defend yourself in civil or criminal court.
Spraying someone with Mace is (by legal definition) an assault, 
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^
and you must be legally justified to spray someone.

You can easily go to jail or get sued for misusing a defensive 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^             ^^^^^^^^^^^^  *^^^^^^^^^*    
spray or any level of physical force.

  i.e. - If you are a *citizen-unit*.

Keep in mind that the use of any kind of defensive weapon could 
result in death. 

  i.e. - Do the police give a fat rat's ass if they kill the
      citizens by using *chemical warfare* when it is not
      necessary, except to perhaps 'teach someone a lesson'
      by sentencing them to be punished before trial? No.

When to Use - Use of Force Ladder
     Confrontational Avoidance 
     Physical Presence 
     Key Verbal Skills 
     Body Language - Assault is Imminent/Possible 
     Defensive Tactics/Martial Arts/C&R/Open Hand 
     Chemical Weapons 
     Impact Weapons 
     Edged Weapons 
     Firearms 
  
  i.e. - The word "defensive" is used, time and time again in this
      evaluation of the proper use of mace. The words *punishment*
      and *expediency* are, not surpsingly, absent from this 
      discourse.

[If you follow the links to the government material on the use of 
 these deadly chemical weapons, you will find constant references
 to "restraint" of "aggressive" individuals, and as an "alternative"
 to "physical violence."]
