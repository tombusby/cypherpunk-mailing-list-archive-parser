Take_a_look_at_my_latest_rip-off!,

 
Does your long distance carrier give you a flat 9.9 cents per 
minute on your interstate long distance 24-hours-per-day 365-
days per year? AND the ability to ELIMINATE your long 
distance phone bills thru an optional referral credits program? 
AND FREE teleconferencing with up to 450 other members 
(where each member just pays their own 10.9 cents per minute
but no teleconference bridge charges)? 

They don't charge you anything to join, there's no hidden 
expenses or term contracts or catches of any kind and who 
couldn't use one less bill per month?!

Just say the words (words=long distance) and I'll send a 
helpful email that will save you a lot of long distance money 
or even make your long distance FREE thru the optional 
referral credits program! 

Sincerely,  
Larry Price
