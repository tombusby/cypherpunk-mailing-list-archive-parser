(I've changed the thread name to "I have in my hand a working message
recovery system." Some of you may know what this is a reference to.)

Agreed, but this is just the kind of "detail" Congress is already so good
at ignoring.

Declan is right, that Congress will hold PGP 5.5 and its CMR and "Policy
Manager" up and will say, "See, even industry is demanding message
recovery. And here's a program that already does it."

Granted, CMR will not meet FBI requirements for real-time access, and will
not meet SIGIN/COMINT wishes for surveillance-friendly systems, but it's a
start.

I'll bet, as I said in a post a few hours ago, that if CMR is widely
adopted, that various regulatory agencies like the FTC, SEC, OSHA, etc.,
will begin to impose rules about how and where CMR archives are stored....

Then the battle will be 80% over.
