Umm... non-encrypting remailers aren't much use. While something could
be worked out (as for most current Type 1 remailers) allowing hooking in
PGP or whatever, I would wonder whether that would make the remailer
program itself have "encryption capabilities" - a la the "crypto hooks"
restrictions in current export regulations. This would be even more of
a problem for remailers using socket links and DH superencryption to
prevent remailer operators from being pressured to decrypt intercepted
messages.

These prohibitions would also prohibit or at least restrict export of
technologies such as decense and the anonymizer in versions (as is
preferable) using encryption, except _possibly_ (see above) those
hooking in encryption from outside. Circumstances in which such
could be used to defeat US laws include a decense server being used to
prevent the tracing of an in-US pornographic site, if (heaven forbid)
the CDA (or a lesser version, such as one requiring labeling or going
by a "harmful to minors" standard) is found constitutional.

It is rather reminiscent, yes. If, for instance, all it requires is a check
on whether the domain name indicates the _certainty_ of being from such a
country, then it won't be extremely onerous... but I'm certain that the
government will try to interpret it in the most restrictive way possible.
