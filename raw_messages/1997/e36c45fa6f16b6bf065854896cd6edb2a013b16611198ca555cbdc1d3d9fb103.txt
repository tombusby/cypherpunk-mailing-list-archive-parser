About the third thing I imagined, after imagining the world's first
financial cryptography conference, and, better yet, having it on Anguilla
in February; and, after imagining it as Wired's featured 'Deductible
Junket'; was imagining a nice feature article in Wired on the conference
after it was all over.

Thanks to Charles Platt, I now figure I can die and go to heaven, as all
three have happened. :-). Out of Town Newspapers in Harvard Square says
they'll have the July Wired next Friday. It appears that Vince gets a
subscription down in Anguilla, which got there yesterday, and probably
everywhere else, I reckon. So, the checks may take 90 days to clear in
Anguilla, but at least the mail gets there on time...

Stay tuned for details (as we imagine them :-)) about FC98, and about the
FC97 conference proceedings, which should be published by Springer-Verlag
this summer.



Cheers,
Bob Hettinga,
General Chairman,
Financial Cryptography, 1997/98,
Anguilla, BVI

P.S. if you, or anyone you know, is interested in FC98 sponsorship or
exhibition space opportunities, please contact me.
