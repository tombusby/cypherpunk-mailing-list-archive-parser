I don't want to make any suggestions about having a clue or whatever,
but just in case you didn't know, John, I'm not censoring anything,
nor is cuckoo, nor is Dr. Vulis, nor are 1300-plus other subscribers
to this list.  It is all being done by a central "authority".

Now you can't figure out who's on what side?  Or you just can't
decide who to line up with?  In case you hadn't noticed, the
censorship has been admitted a failure, although the denial from
the central "authority" is so thick that some folks on the list
will be hoping for Santa to come save them for some time to come.
