example of how to 'finesse' a cheap shot.

> Shouting Ground Technologies, Inc. is concerned about the increased
> abuse of the internet with "spamming".  In this instance, we find

>   * We do not condone any improper use of the internet, including
>     spamming. 
>   * We respect the right of privacy of individuals, and the right
>     to conduct lawful business unhindered.
...
> In the past few days we've received a lot of complaints about the

...
>  So people are in effect suggesting that we

>     us to liability for their lost business.
>   * Violate their right to privacy by filtering and reading all of

> Presumably we would have the same culpability for all of our clients,
