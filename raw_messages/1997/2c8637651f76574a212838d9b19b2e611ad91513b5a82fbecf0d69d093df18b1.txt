So you are saying the police may compel any and all information from
someone just so long as that person has not been formally accused of a
crime?

The Miranda precedent ("you have the right to remain silent...")
establishes that someone under arrest may remain silent. And someone _not_
under arrest is under no obligation to cooperate, unless subpoenaed, right?

The latest example being the Ramsey case in Boulder ("Home of PGP"). Much
is made of the fact that the Ramseys, not being under arrest, are not
required to *say anything* to the police. (Left unanswered is why innocent
parents whose daughter has been brutally murdered would choose to say
nothing to the police...even I, a skeptic about much that modern cops are
involved in, am suspicious of the Ramseys for their noncooperativeness.)

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
