There's a lot of cryptography work addressing this problem,
with variants like "Mental poker".  You can do things like have
the participants each 
- pick a random number, 
- share the hash of their numbers with each other, 
- then share the random numbers with the casino
- then XOR everybody's random numbers together to feed the 
	casino's card shuffler
- play the game, lose the money
- casino reveals its random number
- everybody compares hashes to verify that it was honest
