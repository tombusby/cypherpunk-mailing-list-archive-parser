OK, more precisely, the justification for cellphone eavesdropping
being illegal and cordless phone eavesdropping not being illegal
was that there's an expectation of privacy from cellphones
("they're from the Phone Company") but not from cordless (everybody
with early cordless phones knew they could receive their neighbor's
calls if they used the same channel.)

Good point.

The latest word from Louis Freeh is that he's all gung-ho to 
investigate the CRIMINAL grandma&grandpa who were EAVESDROPPING
on Newt's phone calls.  Of course, if _he'd_ been eavesdropping
on Newt's phone calls, or yours, it would have been the "legitimate
needs of law enforcement" at work.
