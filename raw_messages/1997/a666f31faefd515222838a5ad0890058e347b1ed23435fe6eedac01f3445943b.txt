So what you are saying, though I doubt you realize it, is that a citizen
*can't* sue 2 or more states as a group. They *must* sue singly and in the
individual state courts.

Of course, this isn't explicity described either, so where does this
authority come from?

This means there is no way to sue states as a group for their actions in
regards to relations to the federal government. So the federal government
can require the states to do all kinds of things and I as a citizen and
effected by those actions can't sue the states but only the federal
government.

Interesting hole. I wonder if it will hold up.
