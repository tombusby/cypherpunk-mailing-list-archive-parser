Great work, Adam!  Pursuant to some of the recent rants on cypherpunks, I
would like to see a proposal for a secret sharing mechanism that would
allow the recovery of a storage-only key with m of n shares in the event
that the passphrase to the storage key is unavailable, with the following
attributes:

1. Secret-sharing should be strongly discouraged for signature and
communication keys, for obvious anti-GAK/GACK reasons.

2. The values of m and n should be definable by the generator of (or anyone
who knows the passphrase to) the storage key.

3. The sharing algorithm and format of the share packets should be
standardised, so that any open-pgp compliant application can recover the
storage key without a passphrase, given the key and a sufficient number of
valid shares.
