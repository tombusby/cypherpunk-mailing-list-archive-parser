Long keys or random keys.

Suppose you need 80 bits of entropy.

If your passphrase is truly random, for example
        9kDt3fagWxglr
You have about six bits a character, so you only need 
thirteen characters.

If, however, your pass phrase is an intelligible english 
sentence, for example
        Wandering past Saint Ives, I saw many fine buildings covered in ivy
across the road.
You only have about one bit per character, so you need an 
eighty character sentence.

If your passphrase is a short intelligible english phrase, 
as most of them are, it will succumb to a dictionary attack.
