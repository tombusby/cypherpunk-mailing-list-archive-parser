Actually, around Redmond, gray skies are much more common.

Really guys, If you want to attack Authenticode (and I personally 
consider it a bandaid on a dangerous system), then stealing or
buying the key is not the approach to take.

I see two possible approaches to prove it's weakness.

1. If they are using RSA, factor the public key. This depends on it's
length. Considering the amount of cpu people seem to be able to 
muster for distributed cracks, etc, I suspect that 512 bit keys will 
soon be vulnerable (equiv = RSA 155).

2.  Write a Trojan Horse ActiveX control which disables the 
Authenticode checking, then covers it's tracks.

No, I'm not working on either of these.
