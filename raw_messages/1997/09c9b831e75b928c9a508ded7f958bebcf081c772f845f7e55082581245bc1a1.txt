LInteger is a set of C++ libraries supporting multiple precision integers.
Also included are libraries supporting chain hash functions and
pseudo-random number generators.

The core multiple precision methods are coded in i386+ assembly language
for high speed. The libraries will only compile under GNU's g++ compiler,
and have only been tested under the Linux and Windows NT operating systems.
It is anticipated that there should not be any problems compiling under
Windows '95, however, and that compiling for OS/2 will only require minor
hacking, if any.

Included as a sample chain hash function is an i386+ assembly
implementation of the Secure Hash Algorithm (FIPS 180-1).  Included as a
sample pseudo-random number generator is an implementation of a
pseudo-random number generator described in Section 3.1 of FIPS 186 (the
Digital Signature Standard).

Complete HTML documentation is provided for all public and protected
methods.  The package is free for both commercial and non-commercial use.

Some of the improvements of this release over version 0.1 include:

 - Pseudo-random number generation. 
 - Probable prime generation. 
 - Easier constructors. 
 - MontyRep and ResidueClass classes. 
 - ASCII I/O in bases 1 to 36. 
 - Overloading of fstreams operators for storage on persistent media. 
 - Easier exponentiation. 
 - Pentium optimizations for multiplication and squaring. 
 - A square root function (by special request). 
 - 8+3 filenames (by special request). 
 - Various bug fixes and speed improvements (and some slowdowns! :) )
