Monger:

Simply because everyone (ok..lots) on the planet are already using it. 
They belabor the obvious in order to build a constituincy. Replace
internet with the word "air" and you have the same effect. 

"We must protect everyone from the abuse of the air you breath.  Evil,
profiteering businessman will ruin it. Terrorists and pedophiles will want
to breath it too -- so you must let us evil, murdering government types
dole out who breaths the air and what it will smell like." 

Be afraid.  Be very afraid. (abbreviated BABVA (tm))
