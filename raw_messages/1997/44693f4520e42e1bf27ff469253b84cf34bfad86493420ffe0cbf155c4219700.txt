When someone dies, it seems to me that you are interested to get at
the archived email primarily, not the odd new emails which is
addressed to that employee.

Regardless, even if you did want to allow the company to be able to
spot check emails arriving for the employee it would simpler, to just
give the employees key to the company.  PGP employees seem to get
upset if you suggest giving companies copies of employess keys -- but
really what difference does it make if the company can read messages
addressed to you with their own key or with your key.

(Clearly in either case you can by pass the whole setup with
superencryption, or just by walking out of the building with a DAT
tape).

Right.  So implement storage recovery, that's what the corp wants to
protect: data availability.

However, in some circumstances this ability doesn't help you much:
because if the recipient is working for a company running pgp5.5 set
up strictly, it'll bounce your mail unless you keep the "MRK" on the
list of recipients.

The SMTP policy enforcer which bounces mails which don't have extra
CMR crypto-recipients seems to fly in the face of your claimed
refusal.

Yes you can hack around it, yes it's optional, but PGP Inc wrote it,
and provides facilities to enforce this behaviour for those that chose
to use it in that mode.

pgp5.5 freeware/personal use also knows how to comply with CMR request
from someone using a company account with policy enforcer, and
strict settings.

I'm not sure that many people have accused PGP of being "evil" or
plotting to sell us out for money.

What many have said though is that there are better ways to implement
corporate data recovery disaster recovery procedures than PGP have
implemented; ways which are much more resistant to abuse by
government.

There isn't that much objection to companies having what ever access
they want; certainly not much for data recovery.
