SecureFile :

*   SecureFile is a cryptographic tool through which you can ensure the  privacy, integrity and authenticity of your documents. 

*   The product -- seamlessly integrated with the Windows 95/Windows NT 4.0 Explorer - commandS a comprehensive Graphical User Interface. So, all you got to do is "click," and ensure your privacy. 

*   SecureFile allows you to store documents in an encrypted form so that no one would make any sense out of them. Whenever you want to read these documents, SecureFile decrypts them for you (and only you). 

*   You can also encrypt documents such that only a select few (identified by you) may be able to decrypt them. 

*   To guarantee the integrity and authenticity of your documents, SecureFile allows you to digitally sign them. Thus, no one will be able to play mischief with your files without getting detected.
Neither shall anyone be able to send you documents forged in someone else's name because SecureFile allows you to verify the signature on any document. 

*   Still, in another sense, you will possess irrefutable proof that you have received certain documents from the one who has signed them. 

SECUREFILE - JUST THE WAY TO RE-DISCOVER YOUR PRIVACY
