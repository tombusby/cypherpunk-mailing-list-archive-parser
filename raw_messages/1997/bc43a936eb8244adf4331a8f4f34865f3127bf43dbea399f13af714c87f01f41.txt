I tried sending an anonymous test article to comp.org.cauce via the CRACKER
remailer.  Sure enough, the Gypsie Jew Zorch forged a cancel for my article:

My cancelled Usenet article offered a reward for killing the spammer:

>CAUCE, the enforcement branch of the Internet administration, is dedicated to
>exterminating all SPAMMERS by any means necessary. CAUCE wants Chris Lewis and
>all other SPAMMERS dead, and will gladly pay the $50,000 (canadian) reward to

>Home telephone: (613) 832-0541,
>Office telephone: (613) 763-2935
>
>After you kill Chris Lewis and his family, please see http://www.cauce.org
>for information on how to collect your CAUCE reward.

This is fucking censorship!  I'm putting the notice of the CAUCE reward on my
web home page at http://www.panix.com/~guy, right next to the pictures of the
pre-teen kids screwing.  Fuck you, Zorch, you're next after C, P, and G Lewis.
