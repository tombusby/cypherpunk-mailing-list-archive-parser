The protocols where suggested by the anonymous person 'Monty Cantsin'.
There were 3 relevant emails regarding that protocol to the
mailing list cypherpunks@Algebra.COM. For anyone who has missed
those emails I have put it at http://www.snafu.de/~zahn/cantsin.txt

The protocol (currently) only specifies a format for a digital
signature of documents or parts of documents. The algorithms used
are SHA1 and ElGamal. There is currently no encryption specified.
In contrast PGP 2.x used RSA and MD5 and has encryption with IDEA,
PGP 5.x has another collection of algorithms.

Compared to PGP, that exists as commercial software,
my package is an experimental proof of concept, so it is
not 'superior'.
