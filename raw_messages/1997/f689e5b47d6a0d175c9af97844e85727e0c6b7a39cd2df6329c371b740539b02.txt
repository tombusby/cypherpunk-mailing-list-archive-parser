Though I've read parts of the book, "Takings," excerpted in "Liberty" and
"Reason," which discuss takings in other contexts, such as where land is
declared to be marshland...not rendered worthles, but very much burdened
over what it had been before. But this may be a slight difference, as land
declared to be marshland is _almost_ worthless, for humans.

If the government said that people could have private diaries provided they
deposited a copy with the government, woudn't this be analogous to these
examples of reporting you cite? I'd call it a "taking," or a violation of
the Fourth.

Such reporting requirements have very real costs, and many scholars are
arguing that they are in fact "takings."

(When I was at Intel, as I've said before, one set of laws demanded that we
give detailed reports on the racial makeup of those we interviewed for
employment, to ensure we met the proper EEOC quotas for interviews (and
hires) of various racial groups. Another law said asking applicants to
state their race and ethnicity was a high crime. So we had to guess. I got
in trouble for writing down "Aryan" for some of the white applicants. I
figured if they wanted this kind of crap, I'd give it to them. I also
estimated the percentage of Jewish blood in some of the applicants, with
anyone with more than 1/16th Jewish blood declared to be "non-Aryan." My
boss was not amused. They never sent me out on college recruiting trips
after 1979.)

Well, I agree. If the courts did not see the imprisonment of 15-18 jurors
for more time than the killer O.J. served as a "taking," with their time
valued at the princely sum of $5 a day (what I would call "rendered
worthless"), then nothing will be ruled a taking.

The only solution is to use crypto anarchy to destabilize the system and,
hopefull, see them swinging by their necks in front of the Washington
Monument. Nearly every politician I'm aware of has richly earned the death
penalty, and I hope to see in my lifetime justice carried out.
