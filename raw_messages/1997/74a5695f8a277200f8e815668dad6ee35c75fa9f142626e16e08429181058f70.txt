Hiawatha, I enjoyed your column (Boston Globe Business Section Sept. 11),
but why don't you announce that you have a PGP key, print it's signature in
a column and ask people to use it to send you news tips? This would enable
a freedom of the press challange to GAK.

Count me in. My PGP key is available from my home page
http://world.std.com/~reinhold and the servers and its signature is printed
in E-mail for Dummies, 2nd Edition, page 232. People are invited to send me
ideas and tips via encrypted mail for future books.
