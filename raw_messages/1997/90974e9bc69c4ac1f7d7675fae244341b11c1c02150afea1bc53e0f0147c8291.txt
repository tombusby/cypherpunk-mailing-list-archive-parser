The proper test is not the Yates test, but the test of Brandenburg v. U.S.
(1969, I believe), which distinguishes between mere advocacy of violence
and "incitement to imminent lawless action" that is "likely to result in
such action." Brandenburg is the leading case.

Under Brandenburg, Tim May or anyone else could call for violent revolution
(or for the commission of other violent acts) and the speech is understood
to be protected. Only an incitement to *imminent* (that is, immediate)
violent action, where such incitement is likely to cause an unreflective
response, is punishable.

The facts of Brandenburg concern a speech given at a KKK rally in which the
speaker called for a race war and "revengeance" against non-whites. The
speech was deemed to be protected by the First Amendment. The decision was
authored by Justice Hugo Black.
