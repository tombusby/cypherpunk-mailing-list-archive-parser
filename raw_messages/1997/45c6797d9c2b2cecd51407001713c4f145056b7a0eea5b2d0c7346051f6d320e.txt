Actually MIT does not take notice of SATs, GSATs and other IQ nonsense.
Basically the tests are meaningless at the upper end of the scale which
is where most MIT students would score and a low score does not in itself
demonstate stupidity. 

If he can get in then its difficult to imagine a better school for crypto in the
US. There is a finacial support program and admission is "needs blind" so 
that grants are matched according to need.

Actually there is a reasonable school for philosophy just up the 
road but its not so good for computer science (it did produce Bill 
Gates.) The AI lab does have a number of people who lean quite
heavilly to the philosophy side.
