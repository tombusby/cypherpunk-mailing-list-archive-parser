>
>Ladies, Gentlemen & Cryptographers,
>
>I'm pleased to announce the imminent release of the premier issue of the
>new "Zimmermann Telegram" newsletter. The Zimmermann Telegram will be a
>regularly-published, paper-based, English-language technical update
>newsletter from PGP's engineering staff, and will cover a variety of
>cryptographic and other lighthearted topics which we may otherwise be
>restricted from discussing via electronic media. The newsletter will be
>sent, in compliance with US law, by regular postal mail to anyone
>interested in technical information about PGP -- anywhere in the world.
>
>If you are now developing PGP-related freeware, shareware, commercial or
>academic cryptographic software, or you plan in future to become a
>registered PGP Developer or PGP World Partner (those programs are currently
>under construction and will be formally announced later) or if you are just
>interested in technical information about cryptography, we think you'll
>enjoy reading our newsletter.
>
>In the premier issue, along with important updates regarding changes to the
>PGP packet format, CRC security problems and new extensions to the PGP key
>format which are not available through any other medium, you'll learn about
>the significance of the "Zimmermann Telegram" name. Meanwhile, visit this
>page: <http://www.nara.gov/nara/digital/teaching/zimmermann/zimmerma.html>.
>
>Scheduled to be mailed imminently, the premier issue will be sent free to
>anyone who provides us with a postal mail address. After that, regular
>subscriptions will require a modest fee (to be announced) to cover our
>mailing costs, but we've committed to offering a limited number of free
>one-year subscriptions to interested members of the cryptography community.
>To request your free subscription, please send email to me at:

>the subscription process via email. Thank you for your patience as we
>deploy rapidly. :)
