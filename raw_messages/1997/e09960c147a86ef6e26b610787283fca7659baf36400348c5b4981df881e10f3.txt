Another "blast from the past." Here Bob talks about showing up in Denver
for the visit by several heads of state, to stage some "street theater."

Odd that he suddenly gets so offended when I say a judge has committed a
capital crime.

Perhaps he's just more scared now than before. Or perhaps he's having
second thoughts about things. Or maybe he's had his visit. The simplest
solution is the likeliest: OTR.

No, I don't have a job.

But there's no way in hell I'm going to expose myself to imprisonment in a
German jail to make some metaphorical point about the resurgence of fascism
in Germany.
