I know that, you know that, but do the lawyers know that?

Shareware and freeware share the same distribution channels, so it is a
problem for freeware until the licence gets upgraded.

I know that.

I just find the current versions on the licence agreement to be not well
thought out.  I expect similar problems to be found in the shareware licence.

By version 2.x of the license agreement, I expect it to be something that
will not make problems for freeware/shareware developers.

[Note: I am not claiming consipracy or illwill by PGP in this matter.  This
stuff just reads like the lawyers had not quite enough understanding of the
issues when they wrote this.  Could be worse, Borland has had some pretty
unworkable license restrictions.  And I won't even get into Microsoft...]
