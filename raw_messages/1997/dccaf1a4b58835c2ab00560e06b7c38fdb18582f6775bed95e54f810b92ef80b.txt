Do you hold US citizenship? If so then, no, your assertion of seperation
from the state is incorrect. It's that pesky "We the people..." thing.
If you want to be considered seperate from the US *AND* you don't want to
pay US taxes then renounce your US citizenship and move to another country
*OR* figure out a way to become your own 1 person church.

Like it or not that's the way it works.

Subsidize means to pay, the government does not pay as a rule pay the
churches anything, that would violate the seperation clause as well.
