I am quite aware of what it takes, it's what I have done using SSZ since
going online to the Internet full time in '92 via modem.

It isn't nice, it's a threat to the utility and security of the remailer.

True, but you take a hit on security if you don't have a personal
arrangement with the provider. It also means you won't be on hand when
the cops come a knocking...better use CFS or something similar. This
will require having some sort of contact point for times when the system
gets rebooted, it's obvious you won't give the pass phrase to the operator.

There are other issues involved like the utility of having a business at 
home and the number of legitimate deductions that can be taken.
