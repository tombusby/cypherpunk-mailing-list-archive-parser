Let's not start this.

Tim wasn't arguing for or against abortion; he made no comments
about abortion. His comment was that the _argument_ used to "legalize"
abortion was unconvincing to him.

If we are going to discuss privacy, that's fine.
It we are going to discuss abortion, there are better fora.
