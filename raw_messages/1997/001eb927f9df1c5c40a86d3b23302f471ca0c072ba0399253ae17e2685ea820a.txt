Subj:  Rabin story

>October saw the blatant inconsistencies between the official version of
events surrounding the Rabin assassination and the truth clash publicly.
Early in the month, Maariv's weekend magazine published a remarkable
collection of testimony from seven policemen and security agents on duty at
the assassination scene that fueled suspicions of a conspiracy from many
formerly skeptical readers. On October 18, the author of this piece was the
victim of an eight minute hatchet job on Israel Channel Two Television's
weekend magazine show that was shown again the next night. Despite the
blatant attempt at character assassination, as Yediot Ahronot reported the
Sunday following, I succeeded in igniting renewed national interest in the
possibility that Rabin's murder was not as officially reported.
>
>First the Maariv report. We begin with the issue of whether the alleged
assassin, Yigal Amir's bullets were real or not. It is not denied by the
Shamgar Commission that "Blanks, blanks," was yelled by someone while Amir's
shot his weapon. The conclusion is that Amir yelled it to confuse Rabin's
bodyguards, a contention he denies. It turns out that more than just
"Blanks, blanks" was shouted.
>
>S.G.- Shabak Agent Under Command of Rabin's bodyguard Yoram Rubin- "I heard
very clearly, `They're not real, they're not real,' during the shooting."
>A.A.- Personal Security Head of the Shabak- "I heard one shot and someone
shouting,`Not real, not real.' I can't say with certainty if it came from
the shooter."
>Avi Yahav, Tel Aviv policeman- "The shooter yelled, `They're caps, nothing,
caps.'"
>
>None of the police or security men heard the famous `Srak,srak,'
(blanks,blanks) shout. The scene they describe is of a number of people
shouting different phrases. What united the shouters was their belief that
blank bullets were being shot.
>
>How many bullets were shot?
>
>A.H.-Agent assigned to Yoram Rubin's staff- "I heard one shot, followed by
another."
>Maariv to A.A.- "Are you certain you only heard one shot?" A.A.-
"Absolutely certain."
>Avi Yahav- "I heard a number of shots. I'm not sure how many."
>S.G.- "As I approached the car, I heard three shots."
>
>The inability of security and police personnel trained to testify in court
to agree on the number of shots is puzzling but on one issue all agree; none
thought Rabin was hurt.
>
>Y.S.- Shabak Head of Security for the Tel Aviv rally- "I heard Rabin was
wounded only when I arrived at Ichilov Hospital some minutes later."
>S.G.- I didn't hear any cry of pain from the Prime Minister and didn't see
any signs of blood whatsoever...It wasn't until some time after that I was
told that Yoram Rubin was hurt."
>A.A.- "Only after a number of inquiries as to whether Rabin was hurt, did I
drive in shock to Ichilov."
>
>None of the security or police personnel detected any sign that Rabin was
hurt, a quite inexplicable fact when one considers that he was not merely
hurt but supposedly shot in the lung and spleen by two hollowpoint 9 mm
bullets. However, the "amateur" film of the assassination exonerates the
witnesses. After the film shows the blast from Amir's gun, Rabin is not
pushed forward by the pressure of the bullet, nor does he evince pain.
Rather, he keeps on walking and turns his head quickly to his left.
>
>Before examining the next issue of the Maariv article, let us skip to the
report on my research on Channel Two. Despite the snow job, one of my points
came across loud and clear and went a long way to keeping my name from being
totally besmirched. I showed the assassination film and pointed out that as
Rabin entered his car, the opposite side passenger door is slammed shut. I
said, the only way the door could be shut was if someone was inside the car
shutting it. This would be in contradiction of the Shamgar report which has
Rabin and Rubin entering an empty car. Channel Two saved my dignity by
saying the door was shut by the vibrations caused by Rabin's entrance.
Throughout the country, people opened their back car doors and started
shaking their vehicles. Nothing could make their doors shut. Further,
Rabin's door was armoured and weighed several hundred more pounds than the
average car door. Add to the facts that the open front door of Rabin's car
did not shut with the back, nor is any shaking of the vehicle in evidence on
the film and you have someone, perhaps the real murderer, waiting for Rabin
inside the car.
>
>Now the testimony of Yoram Rubin, Rabin's head of personal security. On
November 8, 1995 he was quoted as saying in the New York Times that Rabin's
last words to him in the car were that he was hurt but not seriously. Let's
look what he told the police on the night of the murder and later testified
to the Shamgar Commission and at Yigal Amir's trial.
>
>Rubin to the Police from 1:07 AM, Nov. 5, 1995:"I lifted the prime minister
and pushed him into the car."
>To the Shamgar Commission:"He (Rabin) helped me get up. That is to say, we
worked together...We jumped, really jumped. I'm surprised, in retrospect,
that a man his age could jump like that." 
>At Amir's trial: "I grabbed him by his shoulders and asked him, `Yitzhak,
do you hear me, only me?"  In this version Rabin did not answer at all. In
previous versions he said he wasn't hurt badly or actually helped Rubin to
his feet.
>
>Perhaps the most confusing piece of testimony concerns the critical moments
when he enters the car with Rabin. The assassination film shows the opposite
back passenger door being closed from the inside and the other back door
being pushed closed from the outside. Yet Rubin testifies,"We fell onto the
seat together and I slipped between the front and back seat. His legs and
mine were dangling outside as I yelled to the driver,`Get out of here.' He
started driving and I lifted his (Rabin's) and my legs inside and closed the
door. This all took 2-3 seconds."
>
>A most curious incident occurs on the way to Ichilov Hospital, normally
less than a minute's drive from the supposed murder site. The trip took from
9:45 to 9:53. With a minute and a half driving time to go, Rabin's driver
Menachem Damti picks up a policeman, Pinchas Terem, to help direct him to
the hospital. Damti, an experienced driver needed no help in finding Ichilov
but even that isn't the main point. With the prime minister dying beside
him, the altruistic Yoram Rubin says to the new passenger, "I'm wounded.
Bandage me." As for Rabin, we can only guess he didn't care that his wounds
needed much more urgent attention. Terem completed his bizarre testimony by
noting that Damti did not notify Ichilov by radio that he was coming and
thus the hospital staff was totally unprepared for Rabin's arrival.
>
>One conclusion of many that can be reached from the testimony of all the
witnesses is that Rabin was unhurt by Amir's blank bullets and was shot
inside the car. Rubin took a harmless arm wound to cover his role in the
event and Damti picked up a policeman as a witness in case of future
disbelief.
>
>If this scenario or something more insidious is not to be given credence,
all the contradictory testimony will have to properly sorted out at an
honest commission of inquiry. And this hypothetical commission will have to
answer how the back passenger door of Rabin's car really closed as he
entered the vehicle.
