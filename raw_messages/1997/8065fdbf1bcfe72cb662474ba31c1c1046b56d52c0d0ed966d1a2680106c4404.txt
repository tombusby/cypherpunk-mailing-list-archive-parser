I haven't used PGP-Domo but I have run a PGP mailing list using my own
software for OS/2.

You can cut down on some of the overhead by encrypting the message with
multiple keys but this increases messages size. If you have a large # of
subscribers you may wish to break up your encryption into blocks, say 25
keys per message. I think it will depend on your system on how may
subscribers & messages you could handle on a daily basis. Say a user base
of 1000 subscribers with 100 messages/day that's 100,000 encryptions per
day. While I think this would be doable on a PC you would have some
serrious lag. For a large subscription base I would go to a digest format.
This would cut down those 100 messages to say 5-10 digests. This would get
you to 5-10,000 encryptions which would be much more doable.

On the mailing list that I am running I only have 4-5 messages a day with a
user base of ~130 so volume has not been a problem. :)
