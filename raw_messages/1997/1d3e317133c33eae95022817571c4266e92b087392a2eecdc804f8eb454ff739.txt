Yes, Bill it is. *ANY* use of violence for anything other than IMMEDIATE
SELF-DEFENCE is terrorism. Simply being on the *winning* side does not make
your actions any less terrorist. Any use of violence except in immediate
self-defence is in effect saying "do what I say or I kill you". THAT is the
definition of terrorism.

Bill, I have never done anything but been willing to let my views stand on
their own two feet.

Well, if we look at Jan. 1, 1900 as the starting date for our accounting I
would estimate that somewhere between 2 to 5 BILLION poeple have died due
to terrorist acts.

It doesn't make it right whether it is the Khmer Rhouge, SOG, Shinning Path,
The SLA, CIA in Laos or Columbia, Ruby Ridge, KAL 007, TWA 800, IRA, SDS,
Black Panthers, or some old lady in Ill. who wants to committ suicide.

When you kill or threaten somebody for what they believe or what they are you
are committing terrorism.

*NOTHING* justifies turning a democracy into a police state, that is the
WHOLE point to democracies in the first place; NOTHING justifies a police
state. Go back and read the Declaration of Independance again, you missed
something in previous readings.

If anything Bill, *you* are the one who has unwittingly (I hope) swallowed
their jism.

If you yank on a dogs chain and it bites you, it isn't the dogs fault.
