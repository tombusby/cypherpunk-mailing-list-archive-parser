This week in the award-winning Shift Control...

The Hoarding Issue

"Nowadays Charles Saatchi buys up entire shows of new talent in 
the Young Brit Art pack. Recently he bought nearly all the Chapman 
brothers' disturbing child mannequins with penises and anuses in 
peculiar places. And the whole of the Martin Maloney show, 'Die 
Yuppie Scum'. I imagine his art depository must be as big as an 
out-of-town IKEA store, with fork-lift trucks whizzing around it 
and people with clipboards checking stock." - Professor Lisa Jardine 
on art collectors, the ultimate hoarders.

"Mum keeps throwing more and more pairs of shoes into the black 
hole at the bottom of her wardrobe, never to be seen again, even 
though she might only have worn them once. This shoe fixation is a 
trait the rest of the family seems to have inherited. Normal kids 
inherit eye colour from their parents; we all got the urge to stash 
flip-flops." - Emma Caldwell on growing up in a house of maniacal 
hoarders.

"Charlie describes himself as a 'guardian of logic'. 'I've seen some 
super-open people, into Buddhism and Feng shui and geomancing. But 
that,' says Charlie, nodding towards the hoard of jumble, 'is an 
ecclesiastical anathema, trying to combine all things, all religions 
together.'" - Shift Control rumbles through jumble and finds a 
philosopher in the closet.
