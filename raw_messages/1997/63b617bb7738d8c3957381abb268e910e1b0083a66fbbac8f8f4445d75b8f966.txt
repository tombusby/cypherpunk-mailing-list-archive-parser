True, but there are only 3 systems and it is not clear at all which will
dominate and be used by all parties. Also there is the issue of security in
regards to maintaning anonymity when there is such a small pool of parties
to use. Doesn't take a genius to figure out where to hang out and watch the
action.

How? There is certainly no clear mechanism in place. Does the customer
contact each remailer operator prior to sending the traffic, thus opening up
N opportunities for anonymity cracking.

If the operators agree to a system how do we get there? Is it time to have a
anon-remailer conference to settle on distributed payment schemes?

Unless it is pertty serious nobody is going to pay such a fee just to send
an email around. The problem I see is one of scale. The infrastructure for
handling physical mail is very 'bulky' and requires a lot infrastructure.
Email on the other hands effectively rides on the back of an existing
Internet infrastructure for nearly free. Because of the historicaly low cost
for email this would tend to in general indicate a low market value on anon
remailers. This means the cost per msg. must be very low (the aforementioned
micro payments) and hence leads to two realizations:

 -   we need a lot of remailers

 -   we need a lot of traffic to invoke economy of scales

It is clear that neither of these can exist without the other, meaning this
puts us at a chicken-or-the-egg type situation.

True, but it doesn't have the rest of the infrastructure (some detailed
above) in place. To get this to work will take more than a couple dozen
operators swapping some digi-cash between themselves. There are entirely too
many infrastructure and legal issues for remailers to be any sort of
profitable long-term business that will attract non-techie investors.

If you know of some investors please let them know of me as I am very 
interested in commercial remailers (anon & not).
