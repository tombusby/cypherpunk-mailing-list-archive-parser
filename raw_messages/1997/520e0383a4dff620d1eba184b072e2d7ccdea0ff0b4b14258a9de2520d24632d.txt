Federal sentencing guidelines are irrelevant in political cases.  

For example the survivors of the Waco massacre were found guilty 
of trivial technicalities, and then sentenced as if they had been
found guilty of murdering federal agents.  All appeals have been
denied.

Indeed it appears to be standard practice, that if a political
criminal is charged with both trivial crimes of which he (and
everyone else) is guilty, and extremely serious crimes, of which
he is obviously innocent, he will be convicted on the trivia, and
sentenced on the accusations.
