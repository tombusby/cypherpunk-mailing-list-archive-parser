Excerpt From:           Welcome to the
                  Cypherpunks Mailing List (TcM)
                  ------------------------

  Your initial post to the list has been digitally classified by the
Cypherpunks Automated Response system in order to determine the initial
level of reputation capital you will be awarded as a new member of the
Cypherpunks Mailing List (TcM).
...
At Reputation Capital levels below -1, you may be subjected to shame,
humiliation and filtering to the point where the only hope for your
posts being read is for you to post to the list anonymously, as a
"Monger" of one sort or another.

  Kent has obviously read "The Tao of Remailers," which explains
the concept of turning the CypherPunks tools against them as
weapons.
  One has to wonder if Louis Freeh has read the book as well
and is sitting at home sending threatening letters to the
President via a variety of remailers.

  I wonder if it is feasible to design a remailer which sends out
anonymous email which is rated (Anonymous +7 / Anonymous -4) on
the basis of reputation capital?
