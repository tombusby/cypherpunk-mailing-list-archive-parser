I've worked on this topic extensively in the past months (writing a doctoral
thesis on efficiency and risk in the payment system). I can assure you this:
cash in is still and will remain one of the most efficient payment
instruments.
This holds looking at it from a private as well as social cost perspective
with
sufficient empirical support.
