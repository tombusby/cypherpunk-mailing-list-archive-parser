We do not have such laws as far as I`m aware (I try to know as little 
as possible about law and finance/econimics as I find them intensely 
boring, even if they are necessary knowledge as a proponent of 
freedom of action and speech) but in my experience a number of 
employers promote women ahead of men in order to avoid costly 
industrial tribunals brought for discrimination. I also believe for 
the same reasons a lot of known homosexuals, blacks, <insert minority 
group of choice here> are promoted ahead of more qualified white, 
straight males.
