Actually, what I had in mind is just the ability to create your own list of
recipients and use a single group name be what you select to encrypt to 
that
list, rather than having to select each individual every time you encrypt.
kinda like the stuff I've had in my email program for ages. Nothing formal
about the heirarchy, just a way to click on one 'name' and have the keys
I've previously assigned to that name be used.
