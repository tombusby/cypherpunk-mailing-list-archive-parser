               FORMER FBI OFFICIAL SENTENCED IN RUBY RIDGE PROBE

     WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former FBI official was sentenced Friday to 18
     months in prison and fined $4,000 after pleading guilty to the
     destruction of a report criticizing the FBI's role in the deadly
     1992 shootout at Ruby Ridge, Idaho.
     
     E. Michael Kahoe, a former head of the FBI's violent crime and major
     offenders section, told the court he was sorry for his actions.
     
     "I must live every day with the realism of what I've done," he said
     tearfully. "I will always be known as the agent who plead guilty to
     obstruction of justice in the Ruby Ridge case."
     
     Kahoe was sentenced by Judge Ricardo Urbina, who could have given
     him two years. The judge also ordered him placed on probation for
     two years after his release from federal prison.
     
     Kahoe's lawyers said his 26 years of unblemished law enforcement
     experience should be taken into account. Federal prosecutors urged
     the maximum sentence.
     
     In 1992, the wife and son of white separatist Randy Weaver were
     killed during a standoff with the FBI. A deputy U.S. marshal was
     also killed in the siege.
     
     As head of the FBI's major crimes section, Kahoe was responsible for
     preparing a critique of the FBI's performance at Ruby Ridge. Federal
     prosecutors said he repeatedly refused to hand over documents and
     later destroyed the report, which they were able to recreate from
     computer files.
