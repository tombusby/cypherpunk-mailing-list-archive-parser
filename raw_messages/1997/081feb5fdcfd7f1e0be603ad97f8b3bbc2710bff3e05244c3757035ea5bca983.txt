Yeah, but if we get to the stage where most people with email
addresses have PGP keys, sending messages encrytped with PGP won't
reduce the number of people subjected to messages the don't want to
see.

A side benefit of using PGP, is that PGP encryption should add some
overhead to the spammer -- he can probably encrypt less messages per
second than he can spam down a T3 link.
