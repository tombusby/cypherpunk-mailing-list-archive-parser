Is there any specific reason for staying with the 2.0.0 kernel?  (I would
think you would want to upgrade just for the "Ping O' Death" fix alone.)

Has anyone tried IPSEC with the 2.1.x kernels?  Are there a logcation that
describes the differences between 2.0.x and 2.1.x?  (I have not been able to
find one...)  Then again, I have yet to find a list of what was fixed from
kernel to kernel...  (Probibly in some directory of the tar file...)
