We Need donations to continue our development research.  We are a group of private sector inventors and we need Money! The Tri-Pyramidal and Bi-Pyramidal building block a 21st Century Breakthrough needs your help! We're on to something big, I mean huge, and your donation will help to achieve the development of this breakthrough. It's a building block for our oceans.  A structure that will allow mankind to develop Freely our oceans, like never before. Recreation will take on a whole new dimension and people will flock to the seas in delight of the experience and stand mystified by what they see. Earth's Oceans will take on a new meaning with the changes this development will bring. 

My name is  Kenneth Welch. I'm an Inventor in Houston Texas, asking  for your help and donations to make sure that this discovery does not get lost, or even worse, pushed aside like so many other good inventions kept away from the American public by big business rigmarole or weak investor support. Send a dollar, send five dollars, send five hundred!  Whatever you can to make a difference in the development of this Globally  friendly technology. 

Global Oceanic Designs Ltd. (Global), a California limited partnership, has spent the last ten years leading the development of  this alternative to safe sub-sea structures, the Tri-Pyramidal and Bi-pyramidal Structural Hulls. These dynamic hull designs list a multitude of uses, extending from deep within our oceans as small or large submarines, to far out in space as little satellites or as massive space stations. Don't let this technology  be passed over. Remember you can make a difference!
