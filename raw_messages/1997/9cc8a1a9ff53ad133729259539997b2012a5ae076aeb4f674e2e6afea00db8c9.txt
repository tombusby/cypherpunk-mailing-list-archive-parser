Would not this be the perfect senario for the implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing?
Rather that having several people being able to access the data
independent of each other having a shared key where it requited say 3 out of
5 members to access the data?

That way a breach of security of one key does not result in a breach of security of all
data.

Are there any know implementations of this?

Thanks,
