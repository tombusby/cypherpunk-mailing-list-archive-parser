   +I guess I don't understand the distinction you are trying to make,
   +between a  "popular anarchy" and an "anarchy."    Maybe you were trying
   +to distinguish  between "dictatorship of the few (or one)" and
   +"dictatorship of the many (perhaps a  majority)" but it didn't come out
   +very understandably.

   +Put simply, "anarchy is not the lack of order.  It is the lack of
   +_orders_."

       disagree. pure anarchy is not the lack of "orders" --pure anarchy 
       implies that everyone is imbued with that perfect sense of 
       responsibility.

   +No, that's traditional thinking and that's wrong.  See AP part 8. 
   +Freud  believed (as "everyone" else believed, even myself, before AP)
   +that anarchy  was inherently unstable.  But it ISN'T, if the tools of
   +AP are used to  stabilize it.  And no, no altruism is necessary for AP
   +to work as well; no  individuals are being asked to sacrifice
   +themselves for the common good.    Rather, they are given the
   +opportunity to work to achieve a reward offered,  cumulatively, by a
   +number of citizens.

       aah, but that is the difference between a _pure_ anarchy and a  
       _popular_ anarchy.  A pure _anarchy_ is sufficiently idealistic in 
       that _noone_ lacks the necessary resonsibility to keep society 
       moving, each individual in their own niche.  As long as there is 
       perfect responsibility in a perfect anarchy, then there is no need 
       for AP.

       AP is a negative, or _punative_, influence; I might liken it to the 
       Catholic Church which is a religion of fear, and an instrument of
       political control.
