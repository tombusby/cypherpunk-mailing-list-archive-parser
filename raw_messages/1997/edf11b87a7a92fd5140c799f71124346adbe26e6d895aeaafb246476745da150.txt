I didn't write this, but I wish I had.  It is exactly correct,
and well-done.  If I had written I would've attached a nym in 
an attempt to accrue some reputation capital.  (The author 
should e-mail me so I can credit her repcap account. :-) )

Actually I think we are discussing the morality of words, not 
of thoughts.  Words are actions in my book.  (ObDcashPunks: 
Note that the right words to the effect of "I hereby give you 
this cash token.  Signed, Alice" _are_ the same as the action 
of giving the person the cash token.  :-) )

I don't speak for Anonymous (:-)), but what _I_ propose is that
the meme of "it was okay/justified/right for me to say it 
because it should be legal for me to say it" shall eradicated 
from cypherpunks discourse.


The rightness of one's actions is independent from the legality
of those actions.  (Except, of course, that it is sometimes 
wise to avoid doing something illegal out of pragmatic concern
for consequences.)


If a cypherpunk is accused by her fellows of a wrong act, it is
completely irrelevant and out of character for her to reply by
stating that the act is legal.



This is a such an obvious truth that I'm surprised no-one, 
including myself, has brought it up before Anonymous did.
