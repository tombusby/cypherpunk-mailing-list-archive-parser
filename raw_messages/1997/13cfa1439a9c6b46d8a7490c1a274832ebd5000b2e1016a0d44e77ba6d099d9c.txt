A few of you have been kind enough to send some spam to
junk@thehouse.org.  Unfortunately, much of it has been significantly
altered, which makes it less useful.  If you send any junkmail, please
leave the headers and body as intact as possible.   

IMPORTANT!!!

That means you shouldn't make a new message and include the junk mail in
it, you
shouldn't send the junk as an attachment, you shouldn't send more than
one piece of junk in a single message, and you shouldn't quote the
message text by insterting characters at the beginning of each line. 
Most of these things aren't that hard to undo, but everyone does them
a bit differently and we'd rather not have to go through and fix them
all.

The best way to do it:

 sendmail junk@thehouse.org < onemessage

or

 formail -ds  sendmail junk@thehouse.org < manymessages


If you use Emacs and VM, the following code will bind J in the summary
window to do the Right Thing.

(defvar flan-junkmail-address "junk@thehouse.org"
  "The address to forward all junkmail to.")

(defun flan-junk-junkmail (prefix-arg)
  "Send all junkmail to 'flan-junkmail-address and delete it."
  (interactive "p")
  (if (interactive-p)
      (vm-follow-summary-cursor))
  (vm-delete-message 1)
  (vm-pipe-message-to-command (concat "/usr/lib/sendmail "
                                      flan-junkmail-address)
                              prefix-arg))

(define-key vm-mode-map "J" 'flan-junk-junkmail)
