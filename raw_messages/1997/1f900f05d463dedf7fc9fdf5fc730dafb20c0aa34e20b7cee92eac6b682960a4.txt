The only interpretation that makes sense is that certain persons with
"Jewish" blood are worried that their "race" is being polluted by non-Jew
blood. Else why worry that intermarriage (miscegenation) is occurring?

If a Nordic or Germanic or Aryan person were to write the same editorial in
"The Washington Times" about his or her race, it would be laughed off as a
racist paranoid fantasy.

Entity. Of course.
