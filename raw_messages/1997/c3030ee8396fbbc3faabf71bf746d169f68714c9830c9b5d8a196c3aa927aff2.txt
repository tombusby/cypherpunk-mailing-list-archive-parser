There is a solution, a simple one, that can split the repsonsibility.

Encrypt the documents with a normal symmetric cryptosystem, something 
strong and unlikely to be compromised in the near future, say LOKI or 
IDEA, or maybe 3DES if you trust it.

XOR the key with a random value, give the result to your friend and print 
out the random value, sign it and give it to a bank or solicitor as a 
bequest in your will to your friend.

If and when something does happen the friend proves your death to the 
bank using probate or a death certificate, gets the random value, XORs it 
with the string you gave her and she has the key. She can then easily 
decrypt the data. 

Yes, it does involve a third party, but it is unlikely your friend could 
collude with a respected bank or solicitor/notary to recover the key...
Really all depends how paranoid you are.
