This doesn't use a Mauser 1898 action does it? The top feed 5-round clip is
my first clue...

As to first semi-automatic in the country, I believe  the Springfield 1903
has that particular honor. It used a Mauser '98 action also. It's also where
.30-06 got the 06 from...also very popular in WW1 and used as a sniper rifle
through Normandy, after which the Garand pretty much took over.

How can that work if the R. thumb is on the L. side of the gun while the
safety is on the R. side of the gun? Your description leaves me with one of
two mental images. Either my hand is off the trigger guard and I have a loaded
and unsafed weapon or else I have to do some sort of finger gynmastics
around the trigger guard in the same unsafed condition. Scares the be-jesus
out of me...an errant twig could fire a round.

Yep, bet this is some sort of Mauser '98 action...

We're supposed to get rain and more rain starting tomorrow. They say it might
be clear on Christmas but the rain returns on Friday...;(

Stay warm & thanks for the discussion.
