It's the only weakness that's needed to compromise all the keys.

I don't have any problem with the feature, only with the use of the 
PGP reputation capital to directly promote it. If they wanted to call 
it 'Pretty Corporate Privacy' then the name would reflect its purpose.

Security, in regard to privacy, is an all-or-nothing issue. As such, 
I do not find it acceptable to apply the same standards of promotion
and dissemination as with less important types of software.
The fact of the matter is, the product has nothing to do with the
privacy of the individual using it, only the privacy of the
corporation. This is an important distincion which should not be
subject to confusion with a product by the same name which is noted
for providing a secure level of privacy for the individual.

I would wager that promoting a false sense of security, or an incorrect
view of the levels of security and trust involved in company software
will do more damage than the occassional loss of keys will.

Again, the product does not provide 'Pretty Good Privacy,' it does
provide 'Pretty Corporate Privacy.'
