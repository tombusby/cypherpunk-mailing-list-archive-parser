This appears to be the case.  A quick perusal of the Web shows that
NetPics, which was raided earlier this year amidst much fanfare, is
still a booming business with a big array of powerful Web servers,
providing pre-decoded Usenet pictures groups to all comers.
 
This is one high profile child porn prosecution which apparently
fizzled.
 
Still, Netpics advertises that it does not carry about a dozen groups
devoted to the topic of child porn, and monitors other high risk
groups for the purpose of removing illegal material from them.
 
It will be interesting to see how the "only providing a newsfeed"
defense works when the images in question are carefully culled from
known child porn groups, for the specific purpose of sale to a
pedosexual clientele.
