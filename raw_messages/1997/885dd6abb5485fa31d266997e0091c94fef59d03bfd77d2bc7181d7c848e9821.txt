It will certaily tell you if the system is network aware, as to internal
operation and its validity it says nothing. If you want to test it you must
send each remailer in the network a message with a final destination of the
source. If you don't get it back you know the remailer is not online. This
is called a 'loopback'.

So as long as I only send traffic to other remailers the electricity and
such are not charged? How does my local electric company measure this?
If the remailer is turned on there is a cost. Unless you are getting charged
by the packet the cost of operating is indipenant of the traffic until you
have to increase your clogged pipe. Commercialy irrelevant approach.

But it doesn't pay for the cover traffic. It also short changes the
man-in-the-middle remailers since they have to spend resources without
getting recompensed. This would indicate that there is little financial
motive to operate a remailer that deals only with other remailers.

So what keeps me from submitting message after message and never pulling
them out? I guess you just keep paying the bills to pay for the increasing
traffic and the need to increase your pipe to carry it. Commercialy
irrelevant. Also, consider the exponential expansion from cover traffic.

So what if I use a free-net or perhaps one of the free machines at the
public library or at the local college? Or the system at work?
