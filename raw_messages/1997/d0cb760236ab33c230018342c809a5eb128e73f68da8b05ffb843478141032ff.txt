I like "e$", although I seem to be too busy to contribute
regularly to _any_ forum recently.  (I'm always available for
Real Life Meetings in local bars, though...  Anybody going to
visit Amsterdam soon?)

Hey, that's a sufficiently profound "death of cpunks" statement
for me.  I feel the same way-- though I've never been a very
active participant, I really dropped out a few months ago.


I feel like there is more to learn and discuss.  _Much_ more.
It keeps me awake at night sometimes, not knowing exactly what
it is but waiting for it.


But I've had my fill of cypherpunks, and my Objectivist
newsgroup (humanities.philosophy.objectivism), and simplistic
libertarianism.



Keep in touch.  :-)
