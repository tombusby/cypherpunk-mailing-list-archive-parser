This is a common mistake.  Just use the first block of ciphertext as the IV,
and start decrypting from the second block.  Let's say you discover that
key K causes C2,C3,... to decrypt to something intelligible (P2,P3,...),
using C1 as the IV.  What could P1 have been?  Well, we know that
(if IV is the _actual_ IV, which you don't know) E_K[IV^P1] = C1, so
IV^P1 = D_K[C1].  But we now have what is effectively a one-time pad
situation, where P1 is the plaintext, IV is the pad, and D_K[C1] is the
ciphertext.  Thus, if you don't know the IV in a CBC situation, you can
still recover all of the plaintext starting at the second block with
the same amount of work it would have taken to have recovered the whole
plaintext, given the IV (the IV does not in fact add its bits to the
strength of the key), but you learn nothing about the first block
(unless something about the protocol gives you a clue based on your knowledge
of subsequent blocks).
