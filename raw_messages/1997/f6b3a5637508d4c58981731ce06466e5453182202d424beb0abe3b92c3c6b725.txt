Perhaps perhaps not.

Taking a look at modern history would show other wise.

IRA activities brought England to the bargining table though talks have
currently staled.

Jews bombing and attacks against the brittish finaly brought about their
independance.

Palisinian's continued violance has brought the Israelies to the bargining
table and eventually will lead to an independant Palistinain state.

"Terrorist" activities of the Contras finally brought free elections to
Nicaragua.

Many such terrorist activities have brought political sucess to the groups
supporting them.

Hmmm I see to recall that the Brittish Empire showed the same contempt for
a group of fredom loving Americans 200yrs ago. :)
