>During a morning briefing at the Capitol,  Sen. Bob Kerry
>(D-Neb.), talking about his impending new crypto bill, which he will call

>IMPORT restrictions on crypto software.

>Incredible.  We've heard rumblings the folks behind crypto strangling

>Restricting imports, of course, is a kind of de facto domestic
>restriction as well.  It  means that companies can't import strong
>foreign made crypto products to use in their worldwide offices, forcing
>them to use the govt. mandated weaker crypto products.
>
>Next step:  outlawing some domestic crypto products.

>Kerry, when asked if there would be restrictions on private encryption,
