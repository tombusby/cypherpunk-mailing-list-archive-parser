Here's how I do it (it is pretty close to your proposal): 

1) I delete duplicate messages (by looking up the database of
message-IDs) right away
2) I bounce all incoming messages to several other list servers
3) I pipe the article to majordomo for distribution.

Note that majordomo changes headers and I wuold like to feed
other servers with UNCHANGED articles.

Here's the .procmailrc that takes care of this:

(OTHER_HOSTS will be redefined to include, e.g., cypherpunks@ssz.com)

# Please check if all the paths in PATH are reachable, remove the ones that
# are not.
#
# NOTE: I use lockfiles extensively (and even excessively) because
# I do not want to overburden the system. Since I am on a
# PPP link that is not always on, sometimes large amounts of 
# submissions come in simultaneously and that may impair
# performance of the overall system. You do not REALLY need
# to use these lockfiles otherwise.

A very good point.

Yes, we really should make darn sure that no loops are poissible
before inviting people to subscribe to our lists.
