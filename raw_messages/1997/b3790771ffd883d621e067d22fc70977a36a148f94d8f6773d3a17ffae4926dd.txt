 At the risk of thumping upon a well deceased equine carcass, the
original expression was "Load and Lock" (admittedly "Load and Lock"
rolls off the tongue more easily than the inverse) as there were many
weapons whose actions could not be loaded when in the 'safe' position.
There are probably as many weapons where this is true as there where
it is not. In general it makes most sense to check for safe condition
before and after loading.

 But, to answer the orginal question, it is generally used as a
euphemism for "get ready for action" either offensive or defensive.
