You got to be kidding. Tim is not the problem on this list. As any long
time reader of this list surely knows, I do not always agree with Tim. But
it is Tim who writes the well thought out essays, and it are Vulis and Aga
who post day after day that "John Gilmore is a cock sucking faggot",
"Queers must be banned from the Internet" and "Timmy is a convicted child
molester that likes to fuck little children up the ass".

Let's be clear about this: Tim May is a major asset to this list. Vulis and
Aga are slime.

Vulis and similar vermin in the headers _and_ body text.]
