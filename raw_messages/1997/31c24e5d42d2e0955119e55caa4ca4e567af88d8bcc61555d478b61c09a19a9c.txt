Believe it, Igor. There's a large number of people in the country
who believe as she does, though perhaps not too many of them have
the chutzpah to post such opinions to the fight-censorship list
(where it could certainly be interpreted as a troll).

Let's face it, there're a lot of people in the US who'd be happier
if they were governed like China or Singapore; they want a stern
authoritarian voice keeping society 'decent' and the homosexuals
and other 'perverts' under control and out of sight, regulating
what you can read and watch on TV, and what gets taught in schools,
regulating what you can smoke and drink and sniff, and
indoctrinating children into and enforcing the rules of the
locally preferred religion.

While they may pay lip service to it, they care little for the first
amendment (except as it assures //them// the right to express
//their// views or practice //their// religion). Sure, they'll wave
the flag and mouth the words 'Constitution' and 'Bill of Rights', but
their solution to every disagreement is 'put them in jail' or 'pass
another law'.
