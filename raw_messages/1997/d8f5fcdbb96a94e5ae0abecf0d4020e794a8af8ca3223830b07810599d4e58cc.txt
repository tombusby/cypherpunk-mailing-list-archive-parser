> Things That Go Boom in the Night: Scientists working for the National
> Science Foundation have concluded that a peculiar, loud explosion heard
> in the Australian outback in September 1993 was just a meteorite, and
> not evidence of terrorist activity. The explosion seemed to be located
> near a ranch owned by Aum Shinrikyo, a Japanese cult linked to the
> gassing of the Tokyo subway system in 1995 that injured thousands of
> morning commuters. The cult was reported interested in developing
> nuclear weapons and was mining uranium in the area.  However, seismic
> data recorded during the event are better explained by a small iron
> meteorite crashing to Earth.  The meteorite explanation also fits well
> with reports of a bright streak seen in the sky at the time of the
> explosion.
