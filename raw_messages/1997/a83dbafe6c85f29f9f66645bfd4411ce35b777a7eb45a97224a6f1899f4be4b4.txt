The February issue of the _Pinky and the Brain_ comic, based on the
animated television show of two lab mice constantly foiled in their
plans to take over the world, has a main story entitled "Mission:
Unpinkable". Our heroes intercept a stray piece of microfilm and
accept the mission to steal Microstomp's "prototype Internet computer
control chip, the 1286 GAK", with Brain plotting to reprogram the
chip so that...

"When the program is introduced on the Internet, every connected CPU
across the globe will download ME! My personality matrix will soon
control every computer in the world!"

Naturally, the plan goes awry.

One wonders if the writers have been following the "key escrow" debate
here on Cpunks.

Explain to me, slowly and carefully, why if person A, when screwed over on a
deal by B, is morally obligated to consult, pay, and defer to, person C for
the purpose of seeing justice done, and why person C has any legitimate gripe
if A just hauls off and smacks B around like a dead carp. (Michael Schneider)
