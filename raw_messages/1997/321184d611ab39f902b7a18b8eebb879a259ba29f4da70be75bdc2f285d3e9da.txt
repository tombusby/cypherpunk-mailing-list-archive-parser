James Integrated Technologies (JIT Corp), under its Leap into the Future program to educate web users on the ease of electronic-commerce, is contributing $6.5 million in free eCommerce software.  The first 10,000 users to registered at www.webclerk.com will receive a free license for WebClerk, regularly priced at $649.  

JIT Corp's Leap into the Future, introduced on December 16, 1997 is designed to educate business people that they can safely and cost effectively sell and provide service to their customers on the internet. "The $6.5 million gift to our customers will give them confidence that they do not have to fight through the current fears, costs and technical difficults associated with getting on the internet. With free WebClerks they simply leap past the current obstacles and start doing business on the web.

"Our objective is to increase our customer's profitable sales," says  JIT Corp President Bill James.  "In the near future, eCommerce  will replace FAXing, just as FAXing replaced telex.  We have removed the technical complexities of commercial web site implementation, made it powerful enough for big business and priced WebClerk so that even the smallest business can afford to safely provide service and sell on the web."

WebClerk is a commercial data base, prefabricated web site and server.  Users simply import their data and graphics and begin taking orders on the web.  An experienced webmaster, Jason Bright, www.brightech.net, notes, "WebClerk is a straightforward and extensive way to get a commerce site up and running overnight."

WebClerk offers customers numerous features, including technical libraries, interactive customer support and FAQs, forums, catalogs, order entry, order status and secure credit card approvals.

The local webmaster controls the data available for WebClerk to display.  Customers collaborate with WebClerk to access areas of interest as well as make online purchases.

"As the Interactive division of a major advertising and marketing agency (Fallon McElligott), we look for solutions that give our clients a strong and secure presence on the web," says Lynn Heiberger, President of Revolv.  "Most solutions with the capabilities we wanted cost at least $100,000.  WebClerk helped us meet our objectives for less than $10,000."

With WebClerk, small businesses have the same abilities as large businesses to leap into the future. "We're a two-person company making custom labels for home beer brewers.  Changing our web catalog was expensive and beyond our technical ability," says Ernie Bishop of www.ToTheLabel.com.  "With WebClerk we built our catalog in a few hours and are now able to update it in just minutes."

WebClerk has EDI and data synchronization capabilities.  When used with theCustomer, enterprise software, it becomes an integrated part of a total client/server solution running both the web and normal aspects of the business.  A single user version of theCustomer comes bundled in WebClerk.

Setup requires a connection to the Internet, router or modem and a fixed TCP/IP address.  No other software is required for normal operation.  To manage secure
credit card approvals there is a $35 per month and $.25 per secure transaction service contract.  WebClerk runs at a company's site or at a host service provider.

WebClerk runs on either a Macintosh (32 Mbytes of RAM) or Windows NT/95 (64 Mbytes of RAM).

James Integrated Technologies (www.jitcorp.com or www.webclerk.com) is located in St. Paul, MN.  They provide software, training, catalog hosting and support to enable their customers to become technically competitive, sales and service driven.
