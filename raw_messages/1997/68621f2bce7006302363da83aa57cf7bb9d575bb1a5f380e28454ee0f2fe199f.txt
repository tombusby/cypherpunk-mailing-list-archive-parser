THE CLASSIC MIDDLE NAME (continued)

* In Alabama, murderer Billy Wayne Waldrop was executed in
January, and the next month, murderer Dudley Wayne Kyzer was
turned down for parole.  Two weeks later, murderer Coleman
Wayne Gray was executed in Virginia.  In May, murderer Larry
Wayne White was executed in Texas.  In July, Maryland inmate
Richard Wayne Willoughby was sentenced to life in prison for
killing another inmate.  And once again this April 19, the nation
was reminded that the Oklahoma City bombing date
commemorated not only the seige at Waco, but the 1995 Arkansas
execution of murderer and militia hero Richard Wayne Snell. 


AUTHENTICITY:  All news stories mentioned in News of the
Weird are from news stories appearing in daily newspapers in the
U. S. and Canada (or occasionally, reputable daily newspapers in
other countries or other reputable magazines and journals).  No
so-called supermarket tabloid, and no story that was not intended
to be "news," is ever the source of a News of the Weird story.
