Whoever wrote this isn't paying attention.

S/MIMEv3 is an IETF process and also uses patent free algorithms.

pgp5.x had corporate message recovery (CMR) features in it from the
git-go.  Not quite as bad as KRAP (Key Recovery Alliance Partnership
-- the government toady scheme for companies argreeing to add GAK to
their products), but still risky stuff the way that they implemented
it.  Anyone who is interested should read:

	http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/cdr/

where I attempt to compare the risks of PGP Inc's method of disaster
recovery with more logical and more secure alternatives.

The folks at PGP Inc who poo-pooed the uproar caused by their CMR
exploits are now left with the thought that they have built the GAK
mechanism for a KRAP company.  The KRAP program calls for companies to
implement GAK in a two year time-frame, in exchange for this they have
the bribe of being allowed to export puny 56 bit encryption in place
of the joke 40 bit encryption.  So it may be necessary to forget PGP
Inc.  If I was PRZ I would demand that the name PGP not be used for
KRAP.

Yup, they're government sell outs who are part of the "program"
helping government to install key recovery government master back door
keys etc.  PGP Inc's CMR looks set to be the architecture for GAK much
earlier than it's detractors predicted.  Shame on those at PGP who
invented it, and defended it.

Not really, they are allowed to export 56 bit crypto which is still
ultra puny.  They won't be able to export 128 bit IDEA, or 128 bit
CAST, or 112 bit 3DES which is what PGP5.x uses.  So they'll either
need two versions or they'll dumb down the whole lot to 56 bits, which
is just too weak by far.

Many of us were already upset with PRZ for his part in the development
of CMR, and for allowing it to happen.  It was far too politically
risky a technology to associate with the PGP name, or for someone who
cared about privacy or personal freedom to endorse.

I would imagine that PRZ doesn't retain much control.

I hope PRZ does the right thing.

pgp5.x is already tainted with the features to interoperate with
future GAKked software from NAI versions of PGP which will likely have
GAK to comply with McAfee's KRAP program.
