Then why did you begin an abortion debate?

I made no claims one way or another about abortion, but cited the issue as
the main place the "right to privacy" issue has come to the fore. And I
said I found the argument uncompelling. I did not say I was against
abortion, for abortion, or, for that matter, for or against infanticide.

Unsurprisingly, I've gotten some of the messages from folks I often get
when people dislike some post I've made. They go like this:

"Tim, I really like some of your posts. But, Jeez, give it a rest on
foobar! Can't you go back to writing about lahdidah?"

In other words, the reader wishes I would write only about what he or she
is interested in. Well, pay me my consulting rate and I'll do just that.

I've written many thousands of articles over the past 4.5 years...some of
them very long articles, some very short, most of medium length. (I despise
one-line repartee, and I'm glad our list has never fallen into this mode as
so many other lists have.)

I write about what I find interesting. You all know where the Delete key is.

(Of course, a fairly large fraction of my recent posts have been deleted
for you by Sandy, who sends many of my posts to neither the Main list nor
the Flames list. Bet a lot of you didn't know this, did you?)

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
