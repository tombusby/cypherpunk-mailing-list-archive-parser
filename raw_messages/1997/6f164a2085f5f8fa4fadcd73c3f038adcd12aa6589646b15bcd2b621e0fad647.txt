Experts tell U.N. conference 'hate' sites on Internet may be here to
stay

GENEVA (November 11, 1997 2:47 p.m. EST http://www.nando.net) -
Internet hate sites, such as one urging "Aryan brothers and sisters
... to combat racially inferior
parasites," are unlikely to be stamped out because this would limit
freedom of speech, experts said Tuesday.

The need to respect free speech, as well as the sheer size of the
task, emerged at a United Nations seminar as the two main obstacles
to eradicating such material.

The issue has become more pressing as the number of online hate sites
soars and racism, neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism, find new niches on
the Internet, speakers at the meeting said.

But there is no easy answer to the question: who decides what is
offensive on the Internet?

"In Europe, it would be racist to say, 'I don't like Arabs.' In the
United States, we can say 'I don't like Arabs, I don't like pink
people.' Under freedom of expression, it's not against the law," said
Debra Guzman, executive director of the U.S.-based Human Rights
Information Network.

"You can't ban this in the United States," she told a news
conference.

One problem is that Internet technology itself cannot distinguish
between the offensive and the non-offensive, said Eric Lee, public
policy director at the U.S. Commercial Internet Exchange.
