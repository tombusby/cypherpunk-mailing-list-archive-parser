This is in response to the several posts regarding the assumed 
weakness in the program I wrote:

    While it is true that PRNG's are not very good, because of the 
inherent lattice structure, I believe I found a way around that 
problem. To work around the lattice problem, I used a systm of cubic 
arrays. The program first creates sixteen cubic arrays, and fills 
them one space at a time with random characters. When the stream of 
characters to be XORed with the plaintext is generated, it picks a 
random cube and a random location with that cube. The resulting 
"random" character is then XORed with the appropriate character of 
the plaintext. If someone can prove to me that this method is stupid 
or easily breakable, I would actually be happy. So, those of you bent 
on proving that I'm wrong, I heartily encourage you to do so. As I 
mentioned before, you can download both the compiled version *and* 
the source at "http://www.brigadoon.com/~semprini/3dmx". If you are 
having trouble reaching that site, e-mail me and I will send you a 
copy via e-mail.

    Thank you for your interest and criticisms. They have been 
helpful.
