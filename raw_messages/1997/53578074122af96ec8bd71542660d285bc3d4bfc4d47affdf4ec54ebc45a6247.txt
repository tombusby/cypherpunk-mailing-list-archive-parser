No not at all Phil, while I can't speak for anyone else on the list I
myself am try to bring to attention that no one cared about the children
at Waco that were burned alive at the hands of the BATF. The general
opinion was that those children shouldn't have been there and it was the
fault of the Branch Dividians that the BATF murdered them.

Now the same thing happens to some Federal Employes and now we hear the
cries, and wails, "oh the humanity", "the children the children".

Where was the outrage and demands for justice for the children of Waco.
They were just an "evil cult" their children deserved to burn. I have
heard this logic whispered by more than 1 Federal pig. I for one am sick
and tired of hearing these two faced bastards wine and cry when it happens
to them by cheer when it happen to someone else.

Don't worry Phil they know what a good little sheep you are and are
confidant that you will do your duty when it comes time to fill the ovens.
