Mind being a little more specific?...

 -  What was the dimension of the coil you used?

 -  What was the frequency and amplitude of your signal?

 -  What model of car and it's computer did you test?

 -  What was the orientation and position of the coil when it worked
    and when it didn't?

Some of the best sources are ECM & EECM texts/sites.

While it is a good source of technical info it does take a bull-shit
detector set to full to sift through all the other detritis the ITS wallows
in. Space aliens, hollow earth, over-unity power, etc.
