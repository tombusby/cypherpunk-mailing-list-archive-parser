 Besides the device, the box should contain:
   * Eight little rectangular snippets of paper that say "WARNING"
    * A plastic packet containing four 5/17 inch pilfer grommets and two
                club-ended 6/93 inch boxcar prawns.
 
 YOU WILL NEED TO SUPPLY: a matrix wrench and 60,000 feet of tram cable.
 
 IF ANYTHING IS DAMAGED OR MISSING: You IMMEDIATELY should turn to your
spouse and say: "Margaret, you know why this country can't make a car 
that can get all the way through the drive-through at Burger King 
without a major transmission overhaul?  Because nobody cares, that's 
why."
 
 WARNING: This is assuming your spouse's name is Margaret.
