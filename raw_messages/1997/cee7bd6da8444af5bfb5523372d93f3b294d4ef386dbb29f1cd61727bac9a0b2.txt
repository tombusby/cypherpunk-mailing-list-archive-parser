>>How do you hack a camera?

 Physically damaging the camera works, but can get you jail time.  A better
solution, if you have a nearby office window facing the cameras, is to use
a near-infrared laser (<$100) and blind camera.  A strong IR signal will
easily overwhelm the AGC circuit and cause the camera to behave as if its
pointed into the sun.  All video cameras contain an IR block, but it
generally isn't sharp enough to cut off an 850 nm diode laser.
