Greetings,

The OpenPGP standard discussion is now on the IETF Standards track through the courtesy of the Internet Mail Consortium.

The first event will be an OpenPGP BOF (Birds of a Feather) discussion at the Munich IETF meeting in August 97 (see www.ietf.org) to determine what interested parties want to have included/supported in the OpenPGP standard.

Meanwhile, the IETF OPEN-PGP mailing list is being hosted by the IMC for the IETF. The list mechanism is currently accepting subscriptions, but the list itself will not be active for posting for a few more days (notifications will be made to subscribers when it is active). If you'd like to sign up for the IETF's OpenPGP mailing list now, please send email as follows:

     To: ietf-open-pgp-request@imc.org
   Body: subscribe

 (If your mailer/etc supports "hot" links, just double-click this URL:
  <mailto:ietf-open-pgp-request@imc.org?body=subscribe>)

For related materials, including the archive of the OpenPGP mailing list, please see the IMC website at: <http://www.imc.org/ietf-open-pgp/>.
For information on PGP Inc's involvement with this standards activity, please contact Charles Breed <cbreed@pgp.com> or myself.
