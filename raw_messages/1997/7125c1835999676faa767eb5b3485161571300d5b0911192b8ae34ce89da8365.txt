I.  News from the Front

Newsflash!  ForeFront Launches Dynamic Duo, WebWhacker 3.0 and 
WebSeeker 3.0!

WebWhacker, voted best offline browser by Internet World, has just 
leapfrogged the competition yet again!  WebWhacker 3.0's new features 
include:

*More than 200% faster performance; 

*Now save your "whacked" Web sites virtually anywhere, including 
floppy disks, Zip disks, magneto optical disks, and other removable 
media;

*InstantUpdate, ForeFront's proprietary push technology, which enables 
WebWhacker to update itself across the Internet, instantly delivering 
the latest version of the application to your desktop;

*Integrated WebManager allows you to easily organize and categorize 
your "whacked" sites;

*Filter any unwanted Web pages and files by size, MIME file type, 
file extension, and server directory location;

*Search your "whacked" Web sites more thoroughly with the use of 
Boolean operators;

*The AppBar, which allows you to control WebWhacker in the background 
while browsing, can now become a floating toolbar;

*"Whacked" sites can be exported into a compressed format for easy 
transfer and import; and

*Downloading of background sounds, dynamic images, Shockwave objects, 
JPEG and GIF images, and Java applets.


WebSeeker, the only way to find exactly what you need on the 'Net, 
again proves itself as the only comprehensive Internet search tool 
that finds exactly what you want.  WebSeeker's new features include:

*Over 100 pre-configured search engines, categorized into customized 
folders, such as News, Shopping, and Legal search engines.   This 
allows you to tailor the search by selecting search engine categories 
that specialize in the specific types of information you desire;

*Now you can add your own search engines to the pre-configured list, 
whether they are internet- or intranet-based.

*No more switching between WebSeeker and your browser!  With Microsoft 
Internet Explorer installed you can browse Web pages inside WebSeeker!

*You can now launch WebSeeker with a single click!  Simply click 
Microsoft Internet Explorer's "search" button;

*Faster Phrase searching;

*Ability to drag and drop search results onto the desktop or to a 
printer.

*Substring matching, so a search for CAT also retrieves CATS

II.  Tip o' the Day

Faster 'Seeker

If you have a fast connection, such as a fractional T1 or faster, you 
can dramatically decrease the amount of time a search takes by 
increasing the number of simultaneous connections.  We suggest 
increasing the number of simultaneous connections to 25 or 35.  
Experiment with more...
(You can always decrease the number of connections)

Steps:
1.  Click Tools/Preferences
2.  Select the Network tab (or in Version 3.0, Search Limits)
3.  Change the number of Simultaneous Connections
4.  Click OK
