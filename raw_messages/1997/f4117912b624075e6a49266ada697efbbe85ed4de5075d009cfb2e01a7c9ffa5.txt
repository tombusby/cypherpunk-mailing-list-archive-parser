The problem isn't homophobic hatemongers who use their own names or nyms
or no name, or even get my remailer's name associated with that -
I can reply to complaints or file them in the handy bit bucket.
The problem is forgers signing _other_ people's names to their hatemonger
postings, causing the innocent third party to catch all the
flames that the forger was trying to generate.

Guess I should have been more clear....

Does anybody read X-Warning: headers?  Not all newsreaders even show
all the headers.  It's a good start, and that's clearly the place
in the system to insert it.

That helps, at least if the spammer is doing a lot of it (or if the
spam is from a broken gateway program or whatever.)  But for the
troll that killed my remailer, one message was enough.
