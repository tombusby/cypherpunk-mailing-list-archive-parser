Actually, I might not have chosen the correct words for what I
wanted...
I am looking for sniffer-programs, that analyze e-mail traffic on
the Net and filtering out all e-mails potentially interesting for
_intelligence services_. For example, I've heard, that if an e-mail
contains the words: "assassinate President" (DISCLAIMER: I hope, our
President lives a long and happy life, even after his
impeachment...:)), it will automatically get filtered and checked
out by the Secret Service.
Different intelligence agencies might have similar things in place.
Where could I get some more information about that?

Thanks in advance...

Ciao
