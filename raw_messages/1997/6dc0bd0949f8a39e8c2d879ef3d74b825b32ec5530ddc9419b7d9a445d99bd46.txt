I don't know which person I dispise more.  The person unjustly slandering
another for any reason.  Or the person telling him that he has no right to
an open forum.  No, I take that back.  I'd rather have ten foulmouthed text
wizards dragging my name through the mud, with my self to defend my name as
opposed to even one person declaring that they leave "for the public good".
As for argument, I have no problem with arguing, so long as neither tells
the other to "get lost" so everyone else can have some peace and quiet.
