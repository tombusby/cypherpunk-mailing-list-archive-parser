"Free Speech, Democracy"

 - complete text of a sign put up on a roadside fence in Vancouver by
 university law student Craig Jones.  Jones was arrested for doing so by
 Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who were protecting dictators attending
 the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) meeting in Vancouver,
 November 1997 from dissent.  He was released without being charged
 after 14 hours in custody.
