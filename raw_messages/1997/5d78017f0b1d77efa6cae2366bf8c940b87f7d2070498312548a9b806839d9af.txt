I won't comment on the truth or bogosity of the story, 
but as far as snail mail goes, US mail at least into the early 60s
was cheaper if you left the envelopes unsealed (like 4c vs. 5c.)
I got the impression it was a leftover from wartime censorship.

And email to some foreign destinations was inherently suspicious -
like Swiss banks.  I once knew a guy who used a remailer for his
mail to his bank - he'd mail it to Raoul at the Tijuana post office,
who'd take the cash and mail the inner envelope to the bank.

Mail covers have been legal for a long time as well -
as with pen registers on phones, they don't need a warrant to
track your traffic.
				Thanks!
