When:	Saturday October 11, 12 noon till 17pm

	http://www.pgp.com/pgpcorp/contactpgp.cgi#head

Agenda:
	12-1 - Introductions, Work in Progress, Milling About
	International Law, Electronic Commerce, and Digital Signature, Cem Kaner 
	Virtual Private Networks - Besides FreeSWAN, there's a lot of VPN
		and other tunneling work in the commercial sector.
		Besides privacy uses, it makes it easier to handle your
		Network 10 or Bogus IP Addresses over the Internet.
	Domain Name Security
	PGP5.5 - The Product.  The politics.
	Patents - Merkle-Hellman and Hellman-Pohlig expire!
	Crypto Politics - what is Congress up to this month?
	
Tentative November Agenda and Location: Eric Hughes has arranged with 
	Lawrence Wilkinson, a principal at GBN <http://www.gbn.org>, 
	to do a one afternoon scenario planning workshop on cryptography.  
	Several other GBN people will also be in attendance.  
	We are planning to hold it at the GBN offices in Emeryville,
	which can hold about 40 fairly easily.

After:
	Eat dinner somewhere yet to be decided...

PGP Building Access:

This is an Open Meeting on US Soil and it is free for anyone to attend. 

      There is a minor building security formality due to the facilities
	being in a bank building:  anytime after 12 noon, approach the 
	Bayview Building's Information window (in the plaza, see below for
	directions), and ask the Guard on Duty to let you up to the 
	2nd Floor for the Cypherpunks meeting (use the passphrase 
	"cypherpunks release code"). If you have any difficulty
	(eg. if the guard is on a break), simply call DDT at 
	+1 415 730 3583 he I'll let you in. 
      You can arrive at any time during the scheduled meeting hours, 
	though earlier is better if you want to hear the interesting stuff. 



				Thanks!
