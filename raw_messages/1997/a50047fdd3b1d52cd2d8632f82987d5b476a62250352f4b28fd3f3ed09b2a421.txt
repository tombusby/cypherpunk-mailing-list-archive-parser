The part of it that comes out of their pocketbook does. Just like the part of
'the net' that I pay for belongs to me. The net is a bunch of computers,
running software, hooked together over cables and other links. Each and
EVERY ONE of these require installation, upkeep, repair, and utility
support. This costs money. He who pays the money owns the net, everybody
else is along for the ride.

If we take your argument to its logical conclusion then once a box goes on
the net it belongs to nobody/everybody. Clearly utter nonsense.

If you really and truly believe that the net belongs to everyone and nobody
has a right to limit or otherwise control the hardware and software along
with the associated comm links they own and pay for then you obviously don't
understand what is going on.

ps I also support France's current attempt at forcing the Georgia university
   web site on French soil to use French.
