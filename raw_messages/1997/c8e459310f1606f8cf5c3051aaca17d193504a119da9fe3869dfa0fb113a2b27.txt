"Congress Vs. President On Encryption"

 Last week a bill was reintroduced in the Senate to ease restrictions 
 on the export of encryption technology. But the Clinton administration 
 is preparing to back new legislation proposing additional controls over 
 encryption software, according to sources familiar with the plans.
 The White House is preparing to back legislation that will deal with the
  liability issues surrounding trusted third parties. That legislation may 
 seek to  regulate the entities that will preside over digital signature and
 digital certificate authentication.

 "It's going to be a long, hot summer," Bidzos said.
