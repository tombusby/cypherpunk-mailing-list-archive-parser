I am gratified to see that several people have stepped forward to offer
their services to host this list. I have been contacted by various list
members to host the list here at Infonex. I think there are several reasons
I was approached to do this.

As a long time remailer operator I am used to taking heat for the services
I offer, and dealing with attacks on the services I run. As the owner and
President of Infonex, the list is in no danger of being pulled by the
administration of this site. As the author of Mixmaster I am reasonably
well known (and I hope respected) member of the list. I have been
completely uninvolved in the politics which have plagued the list of late.

I personally favor the multi-node list model, where no one site can censor
the list, the loss of any one node is not catastrophic, and the load on any
one machine is not excessive. Unfortunately I don't think it will be up and
functional in time for the transition. I have already set up the list on my
majordomo server and subscribers are welcome now. The list address is
cypherpunks@Cyberpass.net and the subscription address is
majordomo@Cyberpass.net. The list on my server is subscribed to the
unedited version of the current cypherpunks list. Once the multi-node list
system is perfected I will integrate this list with the other nodes.

Having dealt with the abuse heaped on remailer operators, I think I have an
inkling of what John Gilmore has withstood for years. He has agreed to
forward his list to mine (and possibly others) for a while after the 20th.

It is my opinion that the primary Cypherpunks list should be completely
uncensored and unfiltered. An ecology of filtered lists has developed in
exactly the way many predicted they should. For the record I regularly read
only a filtered version of the list, and subscribe to the full list only to
be able to read referenced articles which were filtered.
