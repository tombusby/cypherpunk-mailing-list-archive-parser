II.  Tip o' the Day

WebSeeker's Filtering  is its most powerful feature.
If you are looking for something very specific on the
Internet, start WebSeeker and enter your keywords.  
Then choose "Filter Find".

FilterFind is slower, but usually worth the wait.  Every 
word on every page is indexed allowing you to quickly
narrow your search.

Choose the Filter button (funnel with 3 dots after it) and
enter any specific query.  You can use AND, OR, NOT,
NEAR and other powerful features to narrow your
search until you find EXACTLY what you are looking
for.

No other program gives you the power of a WebSeeker
search.
  
If you don't have WebSeeker 3 then try it now!
