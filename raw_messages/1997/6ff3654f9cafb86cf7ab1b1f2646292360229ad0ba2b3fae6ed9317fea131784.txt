Subject: H.R. 2991 The Electronic Commerce Enhancement Act

Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R-LA) have introduced
the Electronic Commerce Enhancement Act (H.R. 2991), which would instruct
federal agencies to make versions of their forms available online and
allow people to sign the forms using digital signatures--the online
equivalent of written signatures.  At present, only some government
documents are available online, and most agencies accept only physical
signatures to verify the authenticity of forms sent to them.  Rep. Eshoo
serves on the House Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade,
and Consumer Protection, which is chaired by Rep. Tauzin.
