Or they may have switched sites and have not changed over the back end code
to the new site.

You can always look at the source of the page and see what sites are
contacted.   Look at the form tag and see where the cgi code is located.

If there was a packet sniffer on the line, you would not see it.  Packet
sniffers are PASSIVE.  They just sit and read traffic and record the
interesting (or not so interesting) bits.

find you out, don't give out your address.
