The popualtion might, since too many people seem to think we are the
government's workers, not vice-versa.

The FBI basically complains that the Constitution ties their hands to
enforce draconian laws.

I wouldn't trust the government with anything.  Which suprises me that
stupid parents leave their kids in buildings that are known targets of
anti-government military groups.  Oh well.

Most americans probably don't know what Encryption is.  Most americans
think that because some half-assed monkey Senator says that some guy could
use to send around kiddie-porn without the FBI catching him, they think
that encryption is evil.

Interesting how many americans are getting screwed without ever knowing it.

They sit on their asses, watching their stupid TV shows, believing the
regurgitated shit the media tosses them when one man blows up a building.

Sometimes I want to kick the whole goddamn country in the face.
