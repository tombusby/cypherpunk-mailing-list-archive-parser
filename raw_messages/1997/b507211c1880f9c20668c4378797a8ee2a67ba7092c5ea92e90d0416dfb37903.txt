Oh, I understand that.  But I do expect at least a *tiny* bit of knowledge
on the product by said marketers.  I mean,  the entire base of PPTP is
crypto.  It's like trying to explain a word processor without knowing what
a paragraph is.  When I went to the networks guys, they answered every one
of my questions about the routers, packet sniffing, etc. without
hesitation.  The nice lady with the .5TB RAID array was just as competent.
The only person in that entire truck that couldn't answer my questions was
this one guy.  It just goes back to the old thread of "why don't people
know about crypto?"

If it's broke, send it back.  If it works, take it apart and find out
why.
