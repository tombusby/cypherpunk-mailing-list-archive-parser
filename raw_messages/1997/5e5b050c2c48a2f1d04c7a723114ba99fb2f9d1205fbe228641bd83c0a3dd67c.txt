I worked with the PCCIP and the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Council on their recent infrastructure assurance reports.  The financial sector received high marks and won praise from both groups.
We shared more information about ourselves and our systems than anyone other than the regulators have ever seen.  The investigators were impressed, as would you be if you were to see the unreleased parts of the report.    I expect, however, that much of the report will never be released.

Some of the information we shared included pictures, and physical locations (addresses, floor diagrams), and network diagrams 
identifying payment system and other financial sector traffic and infrastructure.  These kinds of data were shared only because of the protective terms of the information sharing understandings.  This information will not be made public as long as it remains sensitive.  Other information about the specific security infrastructures or the typical security infrastructures employed by banks and the ways we prevent, detect, contain, and pursue compromises is also sensitive.

I would hope that those seeking information about the unreleased portions of the report recognize our interest in protecting sensitive information.
