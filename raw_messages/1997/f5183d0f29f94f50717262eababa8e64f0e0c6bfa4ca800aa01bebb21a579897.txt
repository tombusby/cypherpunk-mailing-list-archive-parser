A member of the Cypherpunks list, who sometimes contributes articles to the
list, engaged several of us in a discussion of some topics. He requested
that we respect his desire not to have his opinions published, which I am
honoring.

However, some interesting topics were raised, and I spent a couple of hours
responding. Rather than letting the points drop into the black hole of such
sublists, I will post my responses here, editing out all references to his
identity.

Things would be so much easier if he'd just post his views to the list. I
surmise that his reasons for not posting have less to do with not wanting
to be associated with my views, as if that is possible in a free society,
and more to do with paranoia about what his employer will think.

(He commented that I am marginalizing myself and my compatriots by my angry
views. I replied:)


>The list was just as "intense" in 1993, for example. Any reading of the

(He predicts that "moderate" list members will leave the list because of my
articles. He says he stopped posting months ago because he saw the general
trend getting worse. )

(He claims I have marginalized myself and says he expects either no reply
from me or a venomous one.)

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
