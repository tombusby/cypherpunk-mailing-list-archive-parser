Remember that distributed lists receive traffic from toad.com, 
BUT NOT VICE VERSA.

It may be very fast due to the fact that not as many users subscribe to

I am not even sure that the topology is known by someone. I can only
state that algebra forwards messages to ssz and cyberpass. I'll let the
other operators state their own connections.
