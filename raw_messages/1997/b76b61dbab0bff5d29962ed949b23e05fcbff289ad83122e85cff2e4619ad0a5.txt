Black Rock, Nevada would be a perfect place for the test. Many of the
high-performance and experimental rocketry groups I am involved in test
their birds there. 10 miles in pretty much any direction of nothing...

Also, why not simply begin to systematicaly approach each source of
materials and ask for donations for a single run test. I am shure there are
suppliers out there who would be sympathetic.
