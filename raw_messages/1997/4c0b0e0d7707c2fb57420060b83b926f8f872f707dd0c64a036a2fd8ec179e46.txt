SingTech Computers, CSA - the two largest computer companies.  CSA being
a completely private company, but listed on the stock exchange.

The hotel industry is pretty much 100% in private hands.  Shipbuilding is
both, airlines 100% govt-linked, public transport - a mixture etc.

Perhaps it behooves noting that not everything is evil in the PAP
policy manual.

Does it matter?  In any case, first grade (we call it Primary 1) is
at age 6 not 5.

None whatsoever.  Public school principals are not rewarded on that
yardstick.  Perhaps you wanna suggest that to the Ministry of Education?

Perfectly valid statements.

So?  Tell me which other country's citizen would not be similarly
shown a "This Is Your Life" book?  Come on.  Nothing unique here.

I take it that you have evidence of this?  I have yet to see anything like
that.

The SBA (god bless them) has stated that what is on your machine is not
of their concern.  They are well aware of their limitations.  Let's
wait till they find their first parry and then we can see if they indeed
are as mild-mannered as they want us to believe.  In the meantime, we
are all vigilant and do not take our freedoms for granted.

So?  They are bozos.  My point in the preceding is that the post was by
someone who claimed to have lived in Singapore for 8 years and I can only
presume that he/she is no longer here.  In spite of that, s/he choose to
be anonymous.  I on the other hand, have to walk along the streets here
and live a life.  I would have to watch my back if I felt that what I say
would be used against me - especially if what I said is false.

And he continues to do so.  Like I alluded to in an earlier reply, our
privacy laws (what laws?) are a joke.

Why you need to deprecate yourself is beyond me.  I enjoy a good debate
on issues and facts.  We can choose to disagree on some issues, agree 100%
on others.  It does not bother me that you claim to be a low-life.  I respect
you and would deal with you fairly nonetheless.
