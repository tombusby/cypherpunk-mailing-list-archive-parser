The basic flaw in all of these analyses stems from lumping all of these
market transactions together into national bins.

The whole "trade deficit" talk, on all sides, suffers from this fatal flaw.
If Company A in nominal nation AA gets more business than Company B in
nominal nation BB, the pundits call this "imbalanced trade." I call it
knowing where the bargains are.

Can't we spare one of our nukes for Brussels? And another for Cherbourg, or
wherever it is the EC has its other HQ?
