I'm not your fellow "cypher punk".

What makes me different from a "cypher punk" is that a "cypher punk"
like Timmy begins to squirm only when his own freedom of speech is
threatened. The concept of defending someone else's freedom, even if
he doesn't share that person's views, is totally alien to Timmy.

Like I said before, any censorship is "too much" censorship, just like
a woman can't be just a little bit pregnant.
