>Update on Bugging Devices
>=================================================
>
>0.902 - 0.928 ghz - Popular Commercial FH/DS Devices
>1.710 - 1.755 ghz - DEA Audio/Video Bugs (over 1400 bugs purchased in 1995)
>1.710 - 1.755 ghz - DOJ Audio/Video Bugs (.25 to .50 watts)
>1.710 - 1.850 ghz - Treasury Video Surveillance Systems
>2.400 - 2.484 ghz - Popular Commercial FH/DS Devices
>4.635 - 4.660 ghz - Treasury Video Surveillance Systems
>
>Most recently purchased gvt microwave surveillance gear seems to be running
>between 900mhz to 5ghz, with a few systems operating on the 7/8 ghz bands.
>
>Also, keep in mind that the pros love to use ultra low power devices which
>use the power lines as the transmission medium/antenna (9khz to 300 mhz).
>Devices typically operate below 10mw, often below 1mw. The devices
>typically use Wide FM and use voice inversion encryption... VERY easy to
>demodulate.
>
>Note: According to a recently obtained DOJ surveillance training manual:
>
>"The typical range for the 28 ghz devices is six miles, the typical range
>of the 2.4 ghz is thirty miles, and the typical range for the 1.7ghz  is 44
>miles."
>
>"... frequency modulated applications should operate below 3 ghz to take
>advantage of the favorable frequency propagation characteristics of that
>part of the spectrum."
>
>"...Frequency Hopping and Direct Sequence Devices spead spectrum devices
>should operate above 1.5 ghz, this will prevent the emissions from being
>detected by electronic countermeasures."
>
>The most popular surveillance reciever used covers 9khz (for CC/VLF) up to
>9ghz, so be sure to cover AT LEAST those bands.
>
>=================================================
>
>All TSCM people have heard about AID devices, but few know the actual freq
>they use, or what they look like.
>
>The devices are VERY popular with the law enforcement crowd, private
>investigators and corporate security types. The equipment is VERY overpriced,
>and the fairly easy to detect.
>
>AID bills itself as "The World's Largest Manufacturer of Electronic
>Intelligence Equipment and Specialized Protective Systems"
>
>AID was founded in 1970, and was sold in 92/93 to Westinghouse (Westinghouse is
>currently selling TONS of equipment to the DEA and State dept)
>
>AID - Westinghouse/Audio Intelligence Devices, Inc. Bug Freqs
>
>135 MHz - 150 MHz  Special Order/Secondary Band
>150 MHz - 174 MHz  Standard/Primary Band (Most Popular)
>216 MHz - 220 MHz  Special Order
>400 MHz - 470 MHz  UHF Repeaters
>
> 21 MHz -  80 MHz  Very Low Power WFM (.5mw - 10mw)  Special Order Only
> 36 MHz -  39 MHz  Very Low Power WFM (.5mw - 50mw)  ***Very Dangerous***
> 80 kHz - 200 kHz  "Line Carrier" Microphone Systems ***Very Dangerous***
> 30 kHz - 700 kHz  Spread Spectrum Current Carrier Devices
>
>1700MHz - 1900MHz  25-250mw Video and audio bugs (Mostly DEA/DOJ stuff)
>2400MHz - 2484MHz  25-250mw Video and audio bugs
>
>If the signal is "scrambled" it is nothing more than simple voice inversion,
>a circuit to "de-scramble" costs around $20.
>
>Note: AID devices are often re-tuned for outband channels... so be careful.
>
>The area of spectrum from 15MHz to 500MHz is the primary threat, 500MHz to 3GHz
>is the secondary threat, a "line carrier" threat is from 30kHz to 750kHz.
>
>If the person planting the bug suspects that a TSCM inspection may be
>conducted then AID suggests a frequency between 30MHz to 50MHz,
>sensitivity of rcvr should be better than .18uv/-122dbm. The mode is
>usually wideband FM.
>
>Also, keep in mind that AID devices are frequently used for illegal buggings,
>so be familiar with their realistic specs, expect power outputs well under
>50mw, and expect to see the AC power circuits being used as the antenna.
>
>Note: Mike Langley at NIA advises that AID/NIA/Westinghouse is totally
>shutting down all TSCM training, at that they have cancelled the production
>of all TSCM products effective 1 Jan 97.
>
>=================================================
>
>Several devices were recently found at a DOE facility on Long Island,
>details are a bit sketchy, but initial information indicates that a
>defecting  middle-eastern FIS agent provided a list of locations within
>several DOE facilties that were being targeted.TSCM inspection (not
>performed by DOE) located several devices. Facility/lab working on designs
>for triggering mechanisms... very interesting incident.

>
>Recently I did some work designing an experimental spread sprectrum
>wireless microphone.
>
>The goal of the project was to see just how small, and how cheaply a
>realistic device could be built.
>
>Initial goal was a device that would use the 47 CFR 15.247 for the ISM band
>from 902 to 928 mhz and an enhancement (jumper change) mode to extend the
>upper frequency range to 954 mhz.
>
>The device would have to have a range of at least 150 feet in a hotel
>building and/or office building (parking lot monitoring).
>
>The device must be small enough to be "dropped in a pocket," concealed in
>the seam of a drape, and placed into furniture.
>
>Device must use consumer (radio shack) batteries.
>
>Device must cost less $100 in materials to build
>
>I felt the above specs would reflect a realistic device.
>
>---------------
>
>1) Battery used was 2ea EPX-76 cells which gave 2.5 to 3 hours of usable
>audio, sub-ed a DL123A lithium which upped the time to over 4 days (and
>still counting)
>
>2) Microphone was two surface mount Seimens hearing aid elements.
>
>3) Spread Spectrum controller was a surface mount WL-9010 from Wireless
>Logic, the chip is a compact stand alone transmitter.
>
>4) Used a Mitsubishi codec chip commonly used in cellular telephone with a
>noise cancelling circuit (this is why two microphones were used).
>
>5) Small pot was used to adjust the output power between .15mw to 65mw
>
>6) All components used where SMT versions, hot flow was used for assembly
>
>7) Entire circuit was assembled on a .30 by .25 inches square double sided
>printed circuit board.
>
>8) PCB soldered directly to battery cap
>
>9) .5 inch long paper clip used as antenna
>
>10) Currently working on a telephone line version.
>
>11) Range at 50mw (legal power limit) tested usable and clear at 260 feet
>(device placed in hotel room, and monitored in the parking lot)
>
>12) Device WAS NOT detectable with an AVCOM 65 until the antenna was within
>8 inches of the device (until a hump started to slightly appear).
>
>
>What doe this tell us?
>
>Spread spectrum devices can be real small, cheaply made, and low power
>using off the shelf products.
>
>Watch that area between 800 mhz and 1 gig
>
>=================================================
>
>We are interested in purchasing old catalogs, training materials, and technical
>documentation used by Audio Intelligence Devices, HDS, and other

>
>   Old product catalogs
>   Sales materials picked up at trade shows (IE: NATIA)
>   Training Manuals from National Intelligence Academy
>   Textbooks from National Intelligence Academy

>
>I recently had a chance to examine a new device made by Delft
>Industries.
>
>It is very similar to the X-Band units I've examined,
>except that the frequencies were higher and mods were much
>more subtle.
>
>Small PCB was cemented into the rear of the unit, underneath the regular
>PCB (black rubber covered 1.5 cm * 4cm * .8cm).
>
>Unit consited of a two microphones, compander circuits,
>power supply/regulator, and modulator circuit.
>
>Compander circuit operated dual circuits around 120hz to 15khz.
>
>No external mods to case, only very small variation in power drain,
>no internal battery, several large surface mount caps...
>
>Entire unit double sided surface mount PCB, looks like 4 layers,
>2/3 digital circuitry, 1/3 analog and RF circuitry.
>
>The only mods to the alarm PCB was the cutting of several traces
>on the back of the PCB (near the emitter circuit).
>
>The doppler alarm operated between 24 ghz and 24.25 ghz, intelligence
>seems to be a 480k bit digital data stream using the alarm
>signal as the carrier (QAM mod).
>
>Looks like one version of the product will also allow someone
>to deactivate a specific sensor remotely upon on command.
>
>According to the factory, the units are being shipped into
>Canada and Mexico in quanity, then transported into the
>US in small quantities.

>Recently had access to some of the new fiber optic devices out there and
>wanted to post some of the techniques by which they can be detected.
>
>
>Subject device optics are made by Corning Glass, and consists of three
>components. The "electronics" are manufactured by E-systems in Dallas, TX.
>
>
>The entire installation kit fits into two 18 * 22 * 7 briefcases made by
>SKB, the first case contains a battery powered automatic fusion
>splicer/LID, equipment to test the installation, and a tool kit. The second
>case contains the microphones, spools of "cable", optical modules,
>controllers, and battery packs
>
>
>1. "Front-End Microphone" is a small glass cylinder roughly 2.5mm wide x
>5mm long with a small 1.5mm long pinhole tube on one end, and a 3 to 12 ft
>50/125 fiber tail on the other. This part of the system is designed to be
>installed "pinhole" style. Pigtail cable is routed to and fusion spliced
>into a "Runner Cable". The microphone contains small barbs to keep it in
>position with out the use of adhesives. A small 2.5mm needle drill bit is
>used to drill the hole.
>
>2. The "Runner Cable" is a 50um/125um fiber optic bundle, typically 3 to 8
>fibers are combined to allow a single runner to support 6-8 devices. This
>cable is flat and measures roughly 125um high, and .75 to 1mm wide. Cable
>has a min. bend radius of 4cm, and is field terminated with a small
>automated fusion splicer to the "Front-End Microphone". This cable can be
>left loose or secured with an adhesive. Installation kit contains a small
>flexible installation tube to assist in installing below carpet or behind
>wood panelling.
>
>3. The "Repeater" consists of a disguised box roughly 15cm x 5cm x 5cm,
>with an optional battery pack/power supply/trickle charger (15cm x 10cm x
>5cm) or the device can be powered directly off of AC Mains. The repeater
>can be easily installed and hidden in a cinder block or concrete on an
>outside wall. It looks like the device is for long term installations, it
>is totally sealed and the electronics have conformal coatings/potting.
>
>Device appears to emit a RF digital signal using 64/128/256 QAM Spread
>Spectrum modulation on programmable frequencies between 1.5ghz and 8.5 ghz.
>Modulator is contained into a "flat-pack" style antenna module. A 512kbps
>baseband signal is supplied to the antenna (bit stream can go as high as
>2mbps, the one I examined was set for 512).
>
>Note: The "repeater" supplies the antenna with a baseband signal, control
>codes, and power. The modulator/transmitter is contained in the antenna.
>
>The device uses an RF guard channel that is used to deactivate all
>emissions (Go Mute) upon remote command.
>
>The "repeater" utilizes 8 fiber outputs (it has 8 field replacable optical
>modules), and one min. SMA connector for the baseband output. Suspect the
>device can also be be uploaded with transmision times. It also contains
>sufficent memory (32mb) to hold a good 4 hours or more of compressed audio.
>
>Repeater can also transmit (Spread Spectrum) over telco or power lines with
>a small adapter (I was not able to secure the frequencies, but I suspect
>somewhere between 200khz and 3 mhz).
>
>
>Device Operation:
>
>System uses a 50/125 Raw fiber optic distribution system, the fiber is
>coated, but not jacketed or buffered in any way. The fiber has a frequency
>response between 1230 to 1550/1710? single mode. I suspect it is standard
>single mode (1500nm) fiber strand.
>
>The "Repeater" contains a low power single mode solid state light source, a
>duplexer/splitter (prism), and a light reciever. The light beam is
>transmitted into the fiber, travels to the "Front-End" where it is is
>reflected against an angled vibrating membrane. The membrane causes a
>slight frequency shift in the light beam, which is reflected back to the
>"Repeater" where it is "picked" off with a prism and solid state detector.
>(typical fiber optic microphone).
>
>
>Counter-Measures:
>
>There is NO METAL in the microphone or fiber distribution system, and they
>CANNOT be detected by a Non-Lin (no non-linear junctions). Nor can they be
>detected with metal detectors, and no electro-magnetic field is present on
>the "Front End".
>
>The "Repeater" section is fairly to detect with a non lin, but since it is
>supposed installed into the outside wall it tends not to be practical. The
>ideal way to detect is to sweep the exterior of the building for RF
>emissions. Also, the unit tends to run VERY hot (110-135 degrees), and
>should be visible as a thermal anomally.
>
>Also, the system can be detected by looking for minute amounts of light
>"leaking" from both the microphone, fusion couplings, and fiber
>distribution system.
>
>The pinhole for the microphone can be detected with a IR visual search
>around 440 to 450nm (you'll need a light source with at least 500,00 candle
>power, the Blue Light Ultra works well, or an Omnichrome).
>
>Once a suspect pinhole is found it can be tested for IR with a conventional
>Spectrum Analyser with a IR front end (the Tektronix SA-42 or SA-46 works
>well). There is always a small amount or IR leakage with this system.
>
>Once the microphone is detected it is a fairly simple matter to trace the
>line back to the controller module or "Repeater"
>
>Keep in mind that the system is designed to use 3 to 8 microphones.
