Not too many people face a lengthy period of imprisonment without trial,
followed by a lengthy period of imprisonment without sentence, for using
a false social security number and possession of a stink bomb.

Actually Jim Bell's greatest offence was being broke.  I have seen some
truly laughable convictions of people with public defenders.  He who pays
the piper calls the tune.  If you are charged with politically incorrect
crimes, and have a public defender, you have two prosecutors and no defender,
and under those circumstances a prosecutor could convict a dog of being
a ham sandwich, and have him sentenced to death by drowning in mustard.
