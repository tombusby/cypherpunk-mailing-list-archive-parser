You obviously have the power and _certainly- the right to delete this
unsolicited message. However, it _does_ contain information that will
be extremely valuable to you regardless of your current employment
situation so I admonish you to read it. Besides, it'll take less than 
one minute.

NOTE: I obtained your e-mail address from a personal search of
Internet ads using a variety of sources. It is not a generic purchased
list, but is highly targeted. It will also be used just one
time...THIS time. You need NOT send a "delete" or "remove" request nor
do any other such nonsense to _not_ receive mail from me again
regarding this information. 

If you have any interest at all in seeing how to _really_ do business 
on the Internet, I invite you to visit:

(If your e-mail program supports it, you can just double-click on the
URL above and your browser will take you there.)
