Dimitri,
  It's simple enough. The man is generous and wants others to 
be able to use his account, free of charge.
  He also wants us to pretend that we are him, asking his ISP to
'confirm' the credit card number he gave them, to make sure it's
the right one.

  When you find out more about the "Electronic Funds Transfer 
information" they mention, could you forward it to the list so
that this fellow's generosity will not go unappreciated?
