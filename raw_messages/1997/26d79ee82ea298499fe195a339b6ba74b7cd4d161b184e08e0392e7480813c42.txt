I thought Kent was a liberal suckup shill, but now I realize he is
merely a stupid jackass. Unless Kent walks around in a semipermanent
state of rectal defilade, having a gun in his posession WOULD have
made a significant difference in each case. A certain amount of
situational awareness IS required to have your gun aimed at the
punk(s) before the punks get the drop on you. Anyone unable to be
aware of their surroundings deserves whatever they get--natural
selection removing stupid genes from the pool and all that.
