Since the definition of "good" above wasn't specified, I substituted 
"efficient."

Let me suggest, however, that in addition to the "choke point" problem, it 
is also impossible, maybe even theoretically so, for a similar reason 
"Maxwell's Demon" is.

Maxwell's Demon, for those unfamiliar with thermodynamics, was a gate which 
was postulated to allow the passage of molecules of energy greater than 
average, and stop the passage of molecules of energy less than average.  The 
net result would have been, theoretically, a separation of a gas into two 
halves of dramatically different temperatures.

However, given such a heat separation, it should be possible through some 
heat engine to extract energy from this difference, and return the  gas to 
its prior statistical distribution of energies.  Was this "something from 
nothing"?

Obviously this appeared to be a serious contradiction, given the various 
laws of thermodynamics, and it was.  It turns out that the source of the 
contradiction is the false presumption, implied above, that it is possible 
to identify and thus separate molecules without using appreciable amounts of 
energy.  Perhaps not surprisingly, the amount of energy needed to do the 
separation is at least as great as whatever amount of energy you could 
theoretically extract from the system, almost magically balancing the books.

I suggest that centrally-planned economic theory may fail for a very similar 
reason:  Implicit in that analysis it is assume that it is possible to do a 
"cost-free" plan, where in reality costs do occur.
