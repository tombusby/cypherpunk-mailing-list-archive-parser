TUCOWS lists the product with 5 cows.
www.pc-magic.com says ZD Net awarded it 5 stars,
but http://www6.zdnet.com/cgi-bin/texis/swlib/hotfiles/info.html?fcode=000IBY
says it's "Not Rated" as of 10/15/97.

Precisely - it looks like they've probably got a friendly user interface,
but doesn't have adequate security.  I'm disappointed that they'd get
a 5-whatevers rating without that quality behind it.

Sounds like it's playing some game using lost chains or equivalent.
No thanks :-)  But it's actually not a bad place to hide stuff,
if you expect amateurs to break into your system.

"As far as we know" means "We haven't applied for export permission",
which means "so we don't have a clue".  If it _did_ have export permission,
that would imply they'd either had some serious discussion with the Feds,
allowing export of a strong product for limited applications/customers,
or else that it was too wimpy for the Feds to care so they said OK.

"Yow!  I'm using rot1313131313 with an 8192-bit key!"
With cryptographically strong algorithms, the key length determines
the amount of work required to crack them.  With weak algorithms,
adding longer and longer keys doesn't help any.

Not a bad goal, for some applications, like communications.
For encrypting disk files, where you'll typically be grabbing
clusters of 512-8192 bytes at a time, it's unnecessary, and
weakening your encryption just to provide it is a big lose.
For some database applications, it may make sense, but generally
the amount of time required to decrypt a block of disk is
faster than the disk's seek time anyway, and I wouldn't trust a
serious database to a system that won't let you run chkdsk
and requires thought before using scandisk and defragmenters.

Many other algorithms actually provide this capability, typically by
using block chaining algorithms like CBC.  Varying the key based on
location in the file reduces the success of dictionary searches,
if done carefully, but if you're using an algorithm that
has a maximum keysize of the blocksize, anybody who figures out
the way you vary the 8-bit key by location can crack it trivially.
Furthermore, you *didn't* say that the key really was more than
8 bits...

Patenting requires revealing the algorithm, losing any supposed 
security you had by keeping it secret.  So you might as well reveal it now,
and let professional cryptographers take a look at it.

Patenting an algorithm doesn't mean the Patent Office thinks it's any good;
that's beyond their expertise.  It means they believe you when you say
it's new and unique, but with cryptography, there's a large amount of
prior art that's outside the expertise of a typical patent examiner.

Being obscure doesn't help - anybody who's trying to guess the password
already knows the victim is using your program, and can disassemble it.

Anybody who's trying to crack somebody's disk drive without their permission
isn't going to be bothered by violating your clickwrap license,
especially if they're police engaged in legitimate crime fighting
or illegitimate warrantless searches.

Doesn't help someone whose disk is already encrypted with your product.

That's not dependent on the algorithm, it's dependent on the interface
used to get the material off the disk.  Some encryption systems
encrypt the whole file on opening, or at system boot,
while others are file system or disk drivers that
encrypt/decrypt a block at a time and never leave the material unencrypted
on disk.  Surely you'd know that if you wrote such a program yourself.

If you don't use a standard algorithm, you need to publish the one you use
so people will know if it's any good.  There are a few people who can get
away without doing this, based on their reputation in the field,
but _you're_ not Ron Rivest, and even _he_ got much flak from the community
for keeping RC2 and RC4 trade secret for a while.  If you had the 
academic credentials to get away with it, you'd also know not to make
statements like the ones you make about export and obscurity.

So do the right thing - use algorithms that there's a good reason
to trust, and do the user interface stuff you do well.
