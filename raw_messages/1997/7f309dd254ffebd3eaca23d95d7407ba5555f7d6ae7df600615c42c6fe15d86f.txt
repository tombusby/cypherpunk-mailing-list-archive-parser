Cypherpunks other than May, Geiger, and the despicable Vulis will
welcome a new civil rights effort which is built around respect for
freedom of speech.

Cypherpunk technologies will be a major force to eliminate racism.
With privacy protected transactions, the color of a person's skin, his
religion and his ethnicity are no longer apparent.  People will be able
to succeed on merit - and not the "good old boys" definition of merit,
where somehow only white males seem to have what it takes.

Cypherpunks need to build bridges to minority communities, to show them
how these technologies can advance their cause.  Racist comments by
supposedly respected list members are harmful and must be countered in
order to show that these views do not reflect the feelings of most
cypherpunks.
