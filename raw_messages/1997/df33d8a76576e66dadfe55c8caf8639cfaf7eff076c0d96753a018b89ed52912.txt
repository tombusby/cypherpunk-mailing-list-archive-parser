  I really disagree with your overall assessment, but yes it definitely 
wasn't in a league with L&O and the script was somewhat uneven

  these were out of line and sort of to be expected these days

  Thats not how I viewed it, I don't remeber the words, but I saw it that 
he was not going to 'go after' the first amendment and cautioned them 
about how unwise that was.

  maybe I am dreaming about something else, but I think they clearly 
showed that he had met with the guy and was fully aware that he was a 
crazy and could be pushed over the line

  definite slime

   well gee maybe we should arrest everyone with a pentium/ppc and more 
than 16 Megs of RAM for possesion of 'cyber-terrorist' tools

>I will admit to a guilty pleasure: the opening scene, where the

   I looked at it with mixed emotions ... BATF is made up of guys and 
gals just like us, some good, some bad, some sheep. The problem with BATF 
is that their leadership sucked and the bad ones got their way. Just like 
years ago, when Philadelphia elected Frank Rizzo (former Police 
Commsisioner) mayor ... he wasn't a bad cop but ran a little rough shod 
over the Bill of Rights from time to time ... with him as Mayor, the 
Philadelphia PD went to hell in a handbasket because all his old cronies 
could get away with murder (often literally!)
