>Greetings folks,

>contest winner (out of 20 entries) is Richard Kennard.
>You will find both entries below, along with a number of
>the honorable mentions.
>
>    Contests are tough... I find a 'winner' out of the
>many good and excellent submissions to always come down
>to a handful of choices... and choosing at that point
>is honestly a random event. It is seldom a winner is a
>'certain' winner. Nancy... you won... and the others?
>several came very close and two others were a toss up.
>
>    The "If I were Dictator" entries were even tougher
>to judge. Especially since after awhile... some were
>beginning to make sense!!! (I need to get a life!)
>Sad thing is... some of these are considered as serious
>suggestions by some of the people I've spoken with over

>IF I WERE PRESIDENT
>===================
>
>Winning Entry:
>
>From: "Nancy L. Osterhaus"
>To: pdejager@year2000.com
>Date: Tue, 21 Oct 1997 16:55:37 -0500
>Subject: If I were President
>
>Action Items:
>
>1.  Communication to the world the magnitude of the problem, the real
>issues, the real impact
>
>This is a denial project.   Most people do not understand the impact of the
>year 2000 on them.. on their lifestyle, the way they do business, and their
>health and future.  I work in a large company that has a strong awareness
>campaign, but during my "time off" talk to local businesses, hospitals,
>etc.   They are very unaware of the issues.  If the grand Y2K world-wide
>project, is to succeed, we need to get past the first phase ....
>Communication & Commitment.  The president could enable this by holding a
>Town Meeting with a panel of experts to explain the problem, impact,
>solution, and government plans for compliance.
>
>2.  Commitment to prioritize and repair of what he's responsible for
>(Government systems, banking, infrastructure, etc.)
>
>Publishing a plan to show people that this is a serious issue, and the
>government has taken the step of prioritizing their systems and developed a
>plan to ensure compliance.  Publish the individual department plans,
>lessons learned, etc.
>
>3.  Publicly report on the progress of government Y2K projects on a regular
>basis (at least quarterly)
>
>Report to the nation and to the world on the progress of year 2000
>compliance in the government sector.  By providing regular updates to the
>nation we will gain increased awareness of the issues and in addition we
>can hold our government accountable for their projects and progress towards
>compliance.
>
>Nancy
>
>==========================================================================
>
>And here are a selection of other suggestions: Some of the good ones,
>most of the great ones and a handful of ringers. You decide which is which.
>Yours truly, Peter.
>
>From: "Dyer, Wayne"
>
>1. Request congress to modify tax code
>        The costs of a company making corrections for Year 2000 should be
>considered an investment in the future - therefore they should be
>treated favorably at tax time. Everything possible should be done to
>encourage companies to deal with the problem - and tax policy is the key
>way to influence business decisions.
>
>2. Limit year 2000 liability
>        The year 2000 problem was caused by "standard practices" in the
>software industry. No company should have to worry about mega lawsuits
>because of year 2000. Companies can be held accountable for the quality
>of their products, but absolutely nothing will be gained by shareholder
>suits against companies merely because they didn't start early enough to
>fully correct the problem
>
>3. Change Social Security earnings limits
>        Retired programmers should be encouraged to "come out" of
>retirement to
>work on year 2000. Because social security benefits are reduced for each
>dollar earned above a set limit, many will probably not want to work.
>This limit should be waived for people working on YR2K.
>-------------------------------------------------------------------------
>From: Kevin Whelan
>
>1. Require Y2K preparedness report from all organizations.
>Require all organizations to file a standard report that would be
>available via Internet on their Y2K preparedness status.
>
>2. All software/hardware vendors publish Y2K info on Internet.
>Require all manufacturers and software vendors to publish by specific
>model and/or version the Y2K compliance status of each of their products in
>use, to be viewable on the Internet.
>
>3. Monthly Y2K TV program during prime time.
>The government will sponsor an hour Y2K awareness TV program monthly
>during prime time from 1998 until it's over.
>
>Kevin
>-------------------------------------------------------------------------
>From: Iain MacKenzie
>
>1. Raise awareness. Real awareness. Tell the people that this is a *real*
>problem, on *all* makes, models, types of computer. Tell them that
>*everything*
>should be checked. Explain *why*. Explain the difference between 'is
>capable of
>storing' and 'is actually populated with' and the connection this has to
>2-digit data entry, for example.
>
>2. Explain what every computer-owner should be doing. Tell them what they need
>to do to check and resolve their own problems. This is the 'facts and data'
>part of the message.
>
>3. Talk about scheduling and panic. There *is* time to fix the problem. (There
>*has* to be, the time is fixed. We (Y2k folk) will have to vary our
>solution as
>time goes by). If all companies establish a plan and follow it we will all end
>up with a h*** of a party on 31/12/1999 but no major problems. A sort of 'Your
>*Company* Needs YOU' message.
>-------------------------------------------------------------------------
>From: "Mau, Michelle"
>
>IF I WERE A PRESIDENT..
>1.      Make Giants Pay
>Make  the major  computer giants - SUN, IBM, MICROSOFT, SAP, ORACLE,
>etc, to contribute $1 billion each for each year  until the year 2001 to
>fund the awareness campaign of the y2k. The idea is to highlight the
>criticality side of y2k which is a business problem - not just an IT
>problem. Everyone from floor operations right through to the  middle
>management up to the senior management should be aware of this bug and
>its impact to the running of the business.  School children should also
>have some idea what this is all about as they are our growing IT
>customers.  Most of  them are already familiar with the Internet and
>computer games.  It is time for IT to lift its game and include everyone
>on y2k - equity through IT is great to break down the social barriers
>and the barriers of haves and haves-not.
>
>2.      TAX   Incentives
>Have an incentive program for SMEs (Small and Medium sized enterprises)
>to have at least 70 percent tax deductions for their expenses in
>managing and fixing y2k bug before Dec 31, 1999. After Dec 31, 1999, the
>tax deduction will be lowered to 30 percent so that these organisations
>will be motivated to start their y2k project now than later to make such
>claims from their tax.  This is already happening in Singapore. It will
>be great if developed nations like Australia could bring this policy
>into effect immediately rather than leaving it a bit  too late.  SMEs
>are the backbone of the industries in this country and they should be
>assisted and motivated to launch their y2k project.  y2k compliance
>definition and testing tools should be made available to everyone via
>the NET, brochures and awareness campaign which I have already
>mentioned.  Perhaps the example set by our Victoria Premier Jeff Kennett
>in providing  jobs  to the unemployed to test software compliancy with
>y2k using a set of standard tools  should be applauded.
>
>3.      Product Compliance Info through the NET
>Use the web to publicise which products are y2k compliant. If these
>products are not yet compliant, where do users get more updated info and
>when will these products be compliant? Which version or model? What
>course of action is recommended to users - retire, replace or risk it?
>What about products which have embedded technology  that may have impact
>on the organisation?

>1.  Fire the head (not the CIO) of agencies which have not made real
>progress now.  Time is a lever which is rapidly getting shorter, and
>agencies are laying this problem on the CIOs without resources.
>
>2.  Get the SEC to investigate the real Y2K project status of industry,
>starting with the embedded systems in the utilities.
>
>3.  Reconsitute the Continuity of Operations Plans of the federal
>government, which have been abandonded and unfunded as a result of the end
>of the cold war.
>-------------------------------------------------------------------------
>From: "Joe Allegra"
>
>1.  Convene a meeting for a couple of days in Washington DC with
>Government and Business Leaders to discuss this issue.  I would prep
>the meeting by coming up with a list of 10 questions that CEOs need
>to ask themselves.  For example:  Do you a credible plan to become
>Year 2000 compliant?  How big is this IT project relative to other
>IT projects?  Has your IT staff ever attempted a project of this
>size?  What is the track record of your IT department in completing
>large projects on time? If you lost all of your computer systems,
>what would be the impact to your business.  etc. etc.  I would also
>bring in people that could document through real live experiences
>how big the project really is.
>
>Having a Washington based meeting convened by the President would get
>the media into this in a big way.
>
>2.  I would convene a high level group to monitor and report monthly
>on the compliance activities of the key sectors of the economy.
>Alan Greenspan to monitor the banking system; others to monitor
>transportation, power, telecommunications.
>
>3.  I would ask the Group of 7 (or is it 8) countries to convene a
>special meeting to discuss this issue at the president/prime minister
>level.
>-------------------------------------------------------------------------
>From: Eugene Hatting
>
>1)      Institute legislation that ALL government institutions must have
>started taking adequate steps by December 1997, in order to address the
>year 2000 problem.
>
>2)      Institute legislation that all large non-governmental
>companies/corporations who make a positive contribution towards the
>economy, must have started taking adequate steps by December 1997, in order
>to address the year 2000 problem.
>
>Hefty penalties and possible criminal prosecutions could follow if the
>above institutions do not abide by these rulings.
>
>3)      I would institute certain tax benefits or other insensitives to
>those companies who have taken adequate steps to address the problem and/or
>who have obtained year 2000 compliance (as defined by my governmental
>department) by date  x.
>-------------------------------------------------------------------------
>From: Yvonne Rediger
>
>1.  Tax break/incentive program for companies that are compliant by a
>specific date.
>        The companies would have to prove compliancy by a set of citeria,
>put in
>place by a board, and that      board would award #2.
>
>2.  A CSA approved Logo.
>        The Logo could be placed on their products and displayed on
>advertising
>etc.  proclaiming them Year 2000 Compliant.  Thus selling insurance that
>their company will be around in the coming years.  Right now any company
>can make that claim.
>
>3.  Make government departments set specific delines for their own
>compliancy and stick to them.
>-------------------------------------------------------------------------
>From: Dr. Ibrahim El-Miligi
>
>a) Set up a presidential working group (please not a committee) to over see
>that :-
>       * All government and semi-government  organizations have or set up a
>plan and initiated action to be Y2K compliant. If not then some penalties
>should be levied (including the firing of some heads)
>        * Should report to me regularly in special meeting of cabinet
>ministers.
>
>b) Media awareness! Medial will be instructed to focus on the Y2K problem
>with interviews, discussion groups, research programs, case studies .. etc.
>I noticed in my country that there is a miserable state of media awareness!!
>
>c) I will sponsor conferences and other forums to give the right perspective
>to the public of the seriousness of the problem.
>-------------------------------------------------------------------------
>From: Rick Mol
>
>The government should not be in the business decision business.  The year
>2000 issue is basically an issue for the various companies to solve
>themselves.
>
>Historically, when government gets involved in making these types of
>decisions, it doesn't do near as good of a job as the free market.  What we
>would end up with is a series of legislative fiats that are made by people
>that have no concept of the problem.  They seem to have this idea that "we
>can pass a law and fix this".  What will happen is that this will cost the
>industry money and add more requirements.
>So, if I were President, I'd get out of the they way and let industry solve
>it themselves.  They will do a MUCH better job than legislation will.

>
>     1. Appoint a leader:
>        Choose a project leader to direct a project to make the entire
>        government (our enterprise) compliant for the Year2000.  Give this
>        person authority to marshall the resources, establish the plan, and

>1) Ensure that there was a "Year 2000 Czar"  in charge of Government

>The fist "charter" of this Czar, would be to make sure the military is at the

>
>2) I would personally address my fellow world leaders with the same

>
>3) I would provide periodic updates to the nation, as to the status of the

>1.      Let the public know.  The American public is still mostly unaware

>might be your bank, gas station, power company, etc. that might fail.
>
>2.      Wake the US government up.  Many agencies still have not got a

>First:

>
>Second:
>I would request that any Government organization that is still running

>1. Declare that year 2010 follows year 1999. Then declare that 1999 was
>really 2009, 1998 was really 2008, etc. etc. It would be much more

>2. Change our current 7 day a week calendar to a 10 day a week calendar.
>That way nobody would know what days of the week dates fell on in the past,

>1. Copyright the Phrase "Year 2000"
>The first thing I would do is copyright the phrase "Year 2000" so that I

>2. Collect the Royalties and Infringement Damages
>Next, I would assign the entire staff of the CIA to spend all of their time
>checking for copyright infringements, so that I could collect my rightful
>royalties and infringement damages.

>3. Move to a Country that is Compliant!
>Finally, I would move myself, my family, and my fortune to the first
>country that is totally year 2000 compliant!!! Thus, I have (a) made a

>1)      Have all calendars in America changed to tick over on 31 December
