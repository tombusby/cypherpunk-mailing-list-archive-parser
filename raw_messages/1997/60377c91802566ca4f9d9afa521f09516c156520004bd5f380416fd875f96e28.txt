Hi,

I am intrested in setting up a cypherpunks meeting in the South East USA. I
think that Atlanta would be a good place for this but I am open to other
locations. I am located in FL so I would like to keep it within a days
drive (Atlanta is 4-5 hrs from me). 

If you would be intrested in such a meeting please e-mail me and let me
know when you would be able to attend and where you are located.

If I can get enough people intrested I would like this to be a monthly
thing simmilar to the meetings on the West Coast.

Thanks,
