I still think you're just rediscovering Usenet technology. Instead of
installing Majordomo, why not install INN, pass traffic as newsgroup(s) (if
you don't like alt.cypherpunks, you could simply start your own top-level
cpunks group(s)), and leave your NNTP port(s) open (or read-only, if you're
an evil CIA brain-stealing censor) so that cpunks at large could connect with
newsreaders or their own servers and send/rcv newsgroup traffic? Many cpunks
could do this (instead of using Majordomo) locally, connecting to each other
to achieve wide propagation and low latency.

And, if you must, run mail-to-news gateway(s) which send the newsgroup to
people who want it as E-mail.

Usenet technology does exactly what you're describing: it's a distributed
database of messages designed to facilitate each server getting its own copy
of every message, and holding it locally for distribution to interested
readers. Other people have been kind enough to write, debug, and document the
software - all you have to do is install it. This could be running tonight.
