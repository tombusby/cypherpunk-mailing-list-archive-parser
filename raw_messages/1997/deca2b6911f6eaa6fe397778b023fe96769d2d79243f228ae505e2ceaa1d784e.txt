Sorry dude, it isn't against the law in Texas to threaten an officer when
they are committing a crime, and trespassing on private property without
permission, in pursuit of a suspect, or a warrant is most definitely a crime
in this state, even for police. In this state if I catch somebody on my
property at night in the process of what I *believe* is theft is even
grounds for me to use deadly force; but *only* between sunset and sunrise.

About 3 years ago we had a female UT-Austin student shoot and kill a peeping
tom in the middle of town. She saw the guy through her window, got her gun,
went outside and dropped the guy. No charges were filed because it was
after dark and his trespassing on the apartment property was enough to
invoke the above referenced law. There was a lot of screaming and yelling
from a bunch of bleeding hearts about it, but the law still stands.

You really should try to understand why you cow-tow to 'The Man'....
