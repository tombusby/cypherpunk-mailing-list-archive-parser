Indeed, while McVeigh, or the guilty person if it was not McVeigh, can be 
categorised as evil, because of his acceptance of the death of a few 
innocents just to get at the guilty, his acts are certainly interesting 
in terms of the reactions they elicit from people and the level of 
reactionism they provoke, of course, it is virtually impossible to have a 
reasonable discussion with any of the sheeple about an issue like this, 
they get scared.

Of course, the consent of the majority of the people in your particular 
corner of the world puts you above the law. Some innocents are more 
innocent than others.

Acts of terrorism always have the same response though, of course McVeigh 
has been painted by the media as public enemy number 1 in the new 
Amerika, a far right extremist, I`m quite suprised actually the 
government didn`t try to put a racist spin on the killings.

Of course, if a government building in some middle-eastern "dictatorship 
of the week" country had been blown up with great loss of life, the 
american press and elected scum would have been falling over themselves 
rushing to congratulate the "heroic American soldier" who had carried out 
this "great act of liberation". By the way, did you know bootlace 
production is up 300% and tobacco rations are going up comrade?
