 If I remember correctly about ten-twelve years or so ago it was
revealed thah the NY Times reporter who won a Pulitizer prize for his
coverage of the 'famine' was exposed as having not only been aware of
what was going on but wa actively involved in promoting the deception
and his award was revoked (not that it mattered much fifty years
later)
