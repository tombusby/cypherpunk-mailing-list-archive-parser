I think this is a dangerous position to take... make that fatal. The code
is already being ftp'ed out of the US. The law would gain you little. But
the new restrictions/enhanced penalties, which will inevitably be included
in any crypto bill that might become law, will set us back severely.
Personally, I hope that none of the crypto bills pending gets passed.
