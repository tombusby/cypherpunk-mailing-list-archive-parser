Okay, call it security but the point is, if you're protecting documents vital 
to your company using encryption (say the design of a new product) and the 
person who knows the passphrase dies, you've just lost a great deal of money.

PGP for Business Security gives the business a way to have a backup key that 
can read that person's information.  Frankly, it might not be able to read 
anybody elses, from the description given.

This is a feature that any business (that understands encryption) will want.

They can easily store the secret keys of the other id someplace secure, and 
never retrieve them until someone dies.  Disavow knowledge of them to 
government, etc.  heck, the keys can even be in the primary person's 
posession.   (Perhaps stored in a safe-deposit box, or without a passphrase, 
etc.)

Amazingly, he gave an example where, had encryption been used, the project 
would have stopped, and restarted because the person with the keys was 
incapacitated.  Are you just being combative here?

Well, any company giving stock advice (and governed by SEC rules on stock 
tips, etc.) is already require to have all outgoing mail approved (e-mail and 
snail), so does it matter if they record it or not?
