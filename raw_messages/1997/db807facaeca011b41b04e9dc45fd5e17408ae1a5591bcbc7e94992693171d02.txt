Hey, that's _my_ line!!! (:-})

I've been arguing the "rejectionist" view for a long time. I even mentioned
this to Bidzos and Zimmermann, separately of course, and they both uttered
some variant of "Sign me up." Could be marketspeak jive in one or both
cases, but probably both saw the essential hopelessness of having Congress
reaffirm the Constitution. And this is all that was ever needed.

As I've said, the problems of whether some company can _export_ some
product, serious as they are to _them_, are as nothing compared to
mandatory key escrow, criminalization of crypto, and restrictions on
domestic use.

It will sail through. Trust me.

Au contraire, "Anonymous." I was there. Maybe you were there (your writing
style reminds me of someone).

What Cypherpunks did then was not to lobby for some law to halt Clipper.
Check the archives if you don't believe this.

We are not "carping" about those "trying to stop this kind of legislation."
Most of us did not condemn Pro-CODE, though it had some flaws. (And
Pro-CODE II was an absolute disgrace, giving power back to the TLAs to
determine algorithms...might as well not even have it.) SAFE was of course
perniciously evil, as it criminalized a form of speech. Nothing in the
Constitution allows such criminalization of a form of speech. But I have
written much on why SAFE is bad leglislation.

In any case, all the much-publicized lobbying of EPIC and CDT and all the
rest to get "compromise" legislation through has led to what? To a
last-minute, politics as usual substitution and passage of a draconian,
Orwellian bill which will change the landscape of freedom in the world.

The only way to fight it is by monkeywrenching enforceability, and by
pushing the limits of offshore communication.

Or by more severe steps. They have earned it.
