    No!. A clear case of the cure being worse than the disease...


I was just kidding.  We do have to take on risks, like people wearing 
clothes, carring packages, ect.  As Igor Chudov @ home wrote recently in 
the Newt's phone calls thread:

We have two seemingly conflicting desires: the desire for security and the 
desire for privacy.  I do not call being searched "privacy" yet I do not 
call not being searched "security".  We need to find creative resolutions 
to these conflicts.

Of course, it is debatable if there is even an expectation of privacy on an 
airplane.  I don't mind terrably being searched in an airport by security 
because I don't expect the privacy.  I expect security.  I don't want to 
die.  If I have things I don't want them to see, there are other ways to 
get it there. I would worry if they cataloged what I had in a database and 
sold it to others.
 The service is just that -a service.  It is not a right.  We can travel 
other ways, too.
My late night ramblings cease, Internaut
