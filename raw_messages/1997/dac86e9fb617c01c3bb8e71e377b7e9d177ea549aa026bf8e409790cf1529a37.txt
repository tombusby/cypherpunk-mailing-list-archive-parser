I would like to see PGPMail support Pegusus Mail for the reason that I have
used the crypto plug-in for Pegusus and found it inadiquate for general
usage.

Pegusus's current crypto hooks do not deal well with remailers and multiple
keys.  PGPMail does not deal with remailers as well as I would like, but it
is far easier to use than the Pegusus solution.
