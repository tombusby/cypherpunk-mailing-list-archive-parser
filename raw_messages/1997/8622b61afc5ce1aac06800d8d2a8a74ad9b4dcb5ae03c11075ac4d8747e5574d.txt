"Toll" tax.
If each packet were "taxed" as it entered a system, and due to the nature of
the internet, when traffic increases in certain areas, prices would go up,
driving activity back down, then each area could "tax" what it wanted.
The only real problem would be how to get people to pay.  Unlike the toll
booth at the entrance to a turnpike, internet users don't keep exact change.
There is no window to roll down to hand the attendant the money, there is no
accepted currency to hand the attendant either.
Taxation can't really begin until e-cash equipped browsers are common.
Plus, executables are fairly large, while text files tend to be small,
adding a bias against executables, images, and audio files.
In addition, since the packets have to originate from somewhere, the
location of the poster would get to tax at least.

Of course, if such a system were not mandatory in a region, then "freenets"
would get a whole new meaning.
