In what sense are you using the word "trolling"?  Are you saying that the
mention of a proposal to ban anonymity is considered "trolling" when posted
amongst a group of pro-privacy, pro-anonymity individuals such as the
Cypherpunks?  Or are you objecting, in general, to the mention of a proposal
to ANY group that's not likely to favor it?

Why should a proposal to require the disclosure of a poster's e-mail address
(and its contribution to the address harvesters) as a pre-requisite to 
express an opinion not itself be fully disclosed and discussed?  Were you
counting on slipping that rule through unnoticed?

Why is publicly disagreeing with you considered a "propaganda campaign"?
Why should the C.A.U.C.E. brand of propaganda be the only variety allowed?

When I first heard of the C.A.U.C.E., my initial thought was that it was a 
good idea.  Finally a means to fight back against the spammers.  Now I'm 
starting  to wonder what sort of agenda is driving some of these illogical
anti-privacy requirements.  As bad as spam and UCE has become, one does have 
to make sure that each proposed cure isn't worse than the disease itself.  
For example, you *COULD* remedy the problem of criminals carrying concealed 
weapons by requiring everyone to walk the streets naked...
