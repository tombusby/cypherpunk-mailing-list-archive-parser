DIMACS Workshop on Formal Verification of Security Protocols
Sept. 3-5, 1997
Organizers:  Hilarie Orman, DARPA and Catherine Meadows, Naval Research
Laboratory


As we come to rely more and more upon computer networks to perform vital
functions, the need for cryptographic protocols that can enforce
a variety of security properties has become more and more important.
Thus it is no surprise that in recent years a number of new
protocols have been proposed for such applications as electronic
credit card transactions, Web browsing, and so forth.
Since it is notoriously difficult to design cryptographic protocols
correctly, this increased reliance on them to provide security has
become cause for some concern.  This is especially the case since
many of the new protocols are extremely complex.

In answer to these needs, research has been intensifying in the application
of formal methods to cryptographic protocol verification.  Recently
this work has matured enough so that it is starting to see application
to real-life protocols.  The goal of this workshop is to facilitate
this process by bringing together those were are involved in the design
and standardization of cryptographic protocols, and those who are developing
and using formal methods techniques for the verification of such protocols.
To this end we plan to alternate papers with panels soliciting new
paths for research.  We are particularly interested in paper
and panel proposals addressing new protocols with respect to their
formal and informal analysis.


Other topics of interest include, but are not limited to

- Progress in belief logics
- Use of theorem provers and model checkers in verifying crypto protocols
- Interaction between protocols and cryptographic modes of operation
- Methods for unifying documentation and formal, verifiable specification
- Methods for incorporating formal methods into crypto protocol design
- Verification of cryptographic API systems
- Formal definition of correctness of a cryptographic protocol
- Arithmetic capability required for proofs of security for
     number theoretic systems
- Formal definitions of cryptographic protocol requirements
- Design methodologies
- Emerging needs and new uses for cryptographic protocols
- Multiparty protocols, in particular design and verification methods


We encourage attendees to bring tools for demonstration.  Information
about availability of facilities for demonstration will be posted later.

To submit a paper to the workshop, submit a one or two page abstract,
in Postscript or ASCII to both organizers at the email addresses given below
by June 16, 1997.  Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection of
abstracts by July 1.  Full papers will be due by August 1.
Copies of papers will be distributed at the workshop.  We also plan
to publish a proceedings.

Participation in the workshop is *not* limited to those giving presentations.
