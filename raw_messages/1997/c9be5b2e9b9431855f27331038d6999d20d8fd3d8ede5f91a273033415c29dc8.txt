No, that one was a Baretta.

The Browning  was the first successfully marketed simi-auto shoulder weapon in *this* country. I believe the Remington M-8 was based on the same Browning recoiling barrel design.

The 95 and 98 Mauser (along with the Springfield) are *bolt action*  arms. They are magazine fed.

You've got yur facts mangled a tad. The 03 is a hand operated bolt action! It was predated in US military service by both the Krag and Lee  bolt actions. The first US service semi-auto rifle, discounting the abortive Pederson device, was the Johnson .30-06!
 . The .30-06 is called the .30-06 Springfield because the original , .30-03, round was loaded with a FMJ 220 gr. slug at around 2000 fps . It proved to be little better than the trapdoor .45-70 which it replaced in the hands of most infantry troops. In190!
6 a new service cartridge with  slightly different case dimensions was introduced sending a FMJ 150 gr. bullet out at around 2500 fps. Later it was up rated to 2700 fps as the brittle case hardened 03 Springfield actions were phased out in favor of  strong!
er "hi-number" 03-A3 rifles. I carried an 03-A3 (serial number 4796575) for  four years. Good dependable weapon and if I could see em, I could generally hit em with it.

>Yep, bet this is some sort of Mauser '98 action...

Nope, don't bet yur gas money , sonny.
