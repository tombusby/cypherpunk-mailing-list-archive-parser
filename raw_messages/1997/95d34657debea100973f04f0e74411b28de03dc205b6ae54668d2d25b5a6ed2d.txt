How about:

"You are about to send a 'referrer header' telling the next web
site about the web page you are currently looking at.  Should
<netscape> send this 'referrer header'?
[Yes/No/Always Send Referrer Headers/Never Send Referrer Headers]

[CHECKBOX] Don't ask again."

Minor UI nit:  it would be much much better if it said


"You are about to send a 'referrer header' telling the next web
site about the web page you are currently looking at.  Should
<netscape> send this 'referrer header'?
[Yes/No/Always Send Referrer Headers/Never Send Referrer Headers]"
