Of course it is.  It hit these companies where it hurts most, their wallet when they try and sell data which purchsers find unreliable and refuse to purchse again or let leak to others thinking of purchasing.  If these companies cannot accurately collect data which customers really don't want to give them (and they may not have a lawfull requirement to request) anyway they may eventually stop asking since they're getting garbage.
