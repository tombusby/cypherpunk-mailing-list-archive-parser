Both of your examples only go to prove the point of anarchy is better then
governments.

In the Salem witch trial they were government trials (which were based on
a political power struggle in Salem at the time) not lynch mobs. 

In Germany, as in all mass murders, was the act of the *Governemnt*.

No matter how you add the numbers up there has been many many more deaths
caused by governments than there ever has or will be by criminal.
