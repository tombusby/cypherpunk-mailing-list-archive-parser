Club of Boston".

had to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for instance),
please let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something
out.

Planned speakers for DCSB are:

March  Daniel Greenwood  The Role of State Government in Digital Commerce

We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on
