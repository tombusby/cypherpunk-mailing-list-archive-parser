This is all nice and good, but the question is who is Chris Lewis, what is 
his connection to northern telecom, what the hell do you mean by forgery, 
are you implying the technology that entrust has in it's secure kernal is 
stolen? Keeping in mind that using public domain algorithms is not theft, 
and also keeping in mind that they have a patent license from public key 
partners, which allows them to use the "rsa" patents, and keeping in mind 
that a fully featured certificate system is much more than just a 
cryptography product. Is the law being broken here? Is there a breach of 
ethics at Entrust?

To restate.....what's wrong with what entrust is doing? Everyone has had 
such a good time talking about spamming and cancels, but I'm really 
interested in how Nortel is somehow committing a forgery.

Also looking around the dejanews stuff about lewis, he seems to be a spam 
cancel freak yes, but no pedophile.

Dimitri,   you seem to be a pretty smart guy...enlighten me on this whole 
thing. Do you mean that Nortel has a hand in the forging of spam cancels? 
Or do you mean that they have a hand in forging software?

I ask everyone on these two forums to inform Northern Telecom Forgers /
Bell North Forgery Research / Entrust that we will boycott their
"security" products as long they continue to employ the child-molesting
pedophile Chris R. Lewis - the biggest forger on Usenet.
