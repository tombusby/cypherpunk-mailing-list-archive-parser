I didn't bother to support that claim because it is trivially 
obvious.  For your benefit:

In *any* organization of size n there are obviously n squared one to
one personal relationships possible.  This is just mathematics.  (Oh,
to be really precise, n^2 - n, since the relationship with yourself
doesn't count).  However, any two people may form an alliance that may
have to be considered as a unit, likewise any three people, up to any
group of size n-1.  Clearly, any large group must impose some
structure to function as a group, otherwise the communication
complexity is overwhelming.  A frequent organization is a hierarchy,
or tree structure, and the standard rule of thumb is that a manager
should have around 7 direct subordinates.  This is all so 
basic...certainly it's kind of fluffy, because all social sciences 
seem kind of fluffy.  But the increase in complexity with 
organization size is observationally obvious, as well.  Compare big 
business to small business.  Compare Boy Scouts with your local 
street gang.

I'm not into the blame game, in general -- you know the old saying
about not assuming malice when stupidity is an adequate explanation?
Blame is a waste of time, in general.  The only thing worth
considering is how to make things better, and sometimes I wonder 
about that.

So what?

One mans attempt to do social good is another man's atrocity, apparently, 
just as one persons freedom fighter is another persons terrorist.  
Any real government has to deal with the fact that people have 
different opinions.
