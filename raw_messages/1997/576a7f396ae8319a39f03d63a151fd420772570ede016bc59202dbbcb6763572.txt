Whether Zionist, Sexist, Sexualist, Racist, or Net.Elitist, all
cabals share similar patterns of operation. They all:

-Assert themselves as "better than" others by some arbitrary standard
of comparison,

-Place great importance on "belonging to", as it relates to groups of
humans with common attributes, and

-Direct power and energy to maintaining the illusion of "better than"
among as many humans as they can.
	
To look at the -real- top level invites much danger if not properly
prepared. 

The existance and proliferation of "cabals" (or groups, cliques, etc.)
is a primary factor in keeping people asleep, irresponsible, and
unaware. Ask yourself who would want to keep people that way.

Remember, people in such states are much easier to control. To use a
popular example, all I have to do is frame someone as a "Fag Basher"
in front of a lot of "homosexuals" to remove that someone from their
graces.

This is because the average citizen is usually emotionally and/or
intellectually attached to some group, as are the freedom fighters.
When the goals of both groups are in conflict (which is common),
people in one group automatically denounce the other.

There is, but it's too simple. Few see it, fewer take it.
