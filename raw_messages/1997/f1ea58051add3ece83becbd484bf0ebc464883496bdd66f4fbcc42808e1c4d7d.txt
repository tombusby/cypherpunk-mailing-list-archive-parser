Good ol' Gary "Shoot from the Lip" Burnore ... gotta love 'im, right?  I
gotta hand it to you, Burnore, you have a knack for snatching defeat from
the jaws of victory.  The "criminal" comment was obviously intended as a
joke, and the poster even apologized for it, but you just couldn't leave
it alone, could you?  You had to go bragging about your "martyrdom" in
San Francisco, didn't you? For further info on Gary's arrest, visit:

First off, it eventually became "a ticket actually" because it was plea
bargained down to that.  That's one of the advantages of committing a
"politically correct" offense in a city like Frisco.  The San Francisco 
Police Department presumably doesn't take people into custody and impound 
their vehicles for mere traffic tickets.

But it does prove that you're willing to break the law to prove a point.
Remember how you bragged about calling a spammer at home at 2 AM to
harass him?  When you say: 

  "Oh no, couldn't have been anyone from this group, right?  BULLSHIT." 
  
you're absolutely correct.  It could have been you! I have no doubt that 
someone who'd dig up an ancient tax lien and post it to Usenet in an 
attempt to embarass and silence a critic could well have done what's 
mentioned here.
