We better start encrypting stuff before we both get in trouble with Dr.MLV :-)

This reminds me of a story of one Sovok biology professor in Illinois.
His wife got a boyfriend. In addition to having real-life sex, they also
exchanged sexually explicit e-mail on AOL which she thought she erased.
One day something went wrong with her computer and she asked the husband
to fix it. He looked at the hard disk with Norton Utilities and saw 6
months worth the erased e-mail, saying things like "I can still taste
your whatever on my lips". Of course all the traffic was in Russian and
it would have served as a "Navajo talk" encryption if it weren't for
the fact that all 3 were Sovoks. The professor kicked the wife out, but
her boyfriend is married, so she's all alone now.

This proves that the masses of normal heterosexuals should be educated
and encouraged to use encryption, not just some homosexual "elite".
