It is often said that American TV is utter rubbish, but
surely this would be the saving grace of such a programme.

I too experienced such an effect a few days ago, when exiting
a stretch of dual-carriageway I saw a car accident up ahead, I
slowed down to see what had happened and saw a police motorcycle
crushed under a car`s wheels, and the badly injured officer being
stretchered away to an ambulance, a grin spread accross my face and
I started laughing. A fine sight.

Of course this story, which, since it involves the injury (and, I sincerely
hope, eventual death) of a jackbooted thug, has a sad side to it, The police
bikes 
were being riden unsafely and without any regard for other motorists (they
were in a 
convoy of about 30 bikes presumably guarding some statist motherfucker), but
I would 
lay money that the driver who was hit by the cop bike is blamed and
prosecuted for 
the accident.
