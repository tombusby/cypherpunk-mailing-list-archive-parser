General Reno has declined to appoint an Independent Counsel to
investigate campaign abuses by the Clinton White House.  Several
Congressional leaders have sputtered they are concerned about
Ms. Reno's conflict of interest in the matter.  Of course, the
Republican specifics of her "conflict" never go past the fact
that she was appointed by Clinton.  However, the connections
between Ms. Reno and the Clinton scandals are well known to at
least one person inside the Beltway.

One example of Reno's conflict is the Clinton China Crypto Scam.
It was Reno's Justice Anti-Trust Division that authorized the
merger of a major company backed by a big donor to the DNC.  The
companies, RSA and Security Dynamics, sought the merger in 1996
just after RSA Chairman James Bidzos signed a memo of
understanding to perform "encryption research" with China.  The
donor, Sanford Robertson, paid $100,000 to the DNC just prior to
the merger.  Furthermore, Mr. Robertson was on the list of those
called by Al Gore from the White House and the MONEY arrived
just after Gore's call.  In fact, $20,000 of Robertson's
donation was split into a HARD money account by the DNC.  Of
course, Mr. Robertson's investment firm made a cool two million
dollars on the merger deal, spurred in part by the lucrative
RSA contract with the PRC.

Yet, Ms. Reno was also directed officially by President Clinton
to oversee the "encryption problem" and enforce policy.  For
example, according to recently declassified documents from the
Clinton National Security Council, Ms. Reno was tasked by
President Clinton in 1993 to oversee the Clipper project.  Ms.
Reno was directed by Clinton to purchase 9,000 Clipper phones
for the FBI.  In addition, Clinton directed Ms. Reno to prepare
Clipper for export.  Finally, Reno was tasked to convince the US
communications and computer industry to voluntarily implement
the Clipper "key escrow" back door into all US made products.
Simply put, Ms. Reno was, and is still, in charge of bugging
America's telephones.

Yet, how far can Ms. Reno go?  According to the Presidential
Directive, "Should (US) industry fail to fully assist the
government in meeting its requirements within a reasonable
period of time, the Attorney General will recommend legislation
which would compel manufacturers to meet government
requirements."

Thus, if we do not voluntarily give up our rights to privacy,
Ms. Reno is tasked by President Clinton with drawing up the laws
for "mandatory" government phone bugs.  Yet, there is
overwhelming evidence that Ms. Reno quietly turned her head as a
major DNC backer managed a deal involving the Communist Chinese
and advanced encryption technology.

Other than approving the lucrative RSA merger/export, Ms Reno
and the Justice Department are also major players in export
policy.  They are part of an Inter-Agency Working group
specifically tasked to cover crypto and exports.  As proof,
Reno's Justice Department has written most of the Clinton
encryption policy papers.  In fact, some of the secret documents
written by Reno's Justice Department on crypto policy were
compromised by former DNC fund-raiser Ira Sockowitz.  Sockowitz
walked out of the Commerce Department with over 2,000 pages of
secrets in 1996.  Ironically, included in the Sockowitz papers
are secret documents covering the 1996 RSA/China deal.

Curiously, Ms. Reno has chosen NOT to look into the matter.

The connections between Ms. Reno and the Clinton scandals are
also well known to at least one person inside the Beltway.  FBI
Director Louie Freeh knows.  He is aware of that advanced
technology was being shipped to China while draconian laws
banning the same technology were considered here.  Director
Freeh also knows that his boss, Ms. Reno, is deeply involved in
criminal obstruction involving high tech exports, DNC donors,
and her own Justice Department.  He knows she is covering for
crimes that she and her Department were charged to prevent.

The question now is...  Does Freeh have the guts to tell
America?
