E=MC  The equation for the atom bomb. It says that matter and energy are the 
same thing. So then what is that? Matter, look at a brick. Its in a three dimensional
form. Its made of electrons,  protons and neutrons (atoms) and they are moving so
the brick is moving. Energy, sunlight. Its in a three dimensional form. It comes to us
from the sun therefore it is moving. 3D and moving Both matter and energy are 3D
and moving. I outproduce Einstein. We already know all matter has gravity. The
bending of light shows that energy has gravity also. So matter and energy are
3D moving with gravity. The universe is made of matter, energy, time and space.
That just stated is the matter and energy part. Time and space. Take everything
in the universe and stop it. Does time progress? No. Therefore time is the motion
and the understanding of all the motion is the understanding of all of time.
Space, it ends. Space does not go on forever. Space is in a three dimensional
form. It moves but does not have gravity. Space moves like this.   O  /\  +  \/  O
And that is the understanding of all of time.
   O   This is what was first in the beginning.
   /\  This is the old kings and queens.
   +   This is democracy.
   \/  This is socialism.
   O   This is when the Lord Jesus Christ returns.
And that is the understanding of the universe.  Glory be to the Father the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Revelation chapter 10 & 11; 15-19. It is very important the
people receive this information. You may tell someone about this.
