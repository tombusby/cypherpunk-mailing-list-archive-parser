Sure there is.  The HR department of Big Well-known Company, Inc. can 
sign the employee's keys.  What's the problem?  If you want to order 
something you do so by generating a P.O. or by using a credit card.  What 
does the web of trust have to do with this?

If you need approval, it's simple, you ask for it.  When you get it, you 
order your 10,000 pencil erasers.  You don't have to use PGP signatures 
for orders, but you can if the infrastructure is there between both 
companies.

No shit.  Both are possible.  Whichever your company wants it will use.

I claimeth not lawyerhood, but IMHO, it can stand up in court if both 
parties agree to it by analog signatures infront of a notray.  Any 
lawyers care to comment?

Not if it is agreed by all parties involved and their lawyers to honor 
such signatures. (IMHO)

Really? you must not have been gotten infected by the slew of Word and 
Excel viruses out there.  Might be a very good lawsuit against Micro$oft 
that they allowed such things to happen.

Standards for a company are standards for a company.  Which standard has 
more weight or importance is up to that company.  Sure, it is on a bigger 
scale that installing XYZ OfficeWare and getting your ass fired, but it 
is still a standard.

Is there any reason that a specific company CAN'T decide to use PGP? (or 
PEM, or some other scheme) if it so choses?

So what's the problem?  You hire people to keep track of assigning, 
escrowing, and signing keys for your employees.  You have IS staff and 
security staff to watch for breeches.  You can automate tons of this with 
good written scripts that automatically scan all email for valid 
signatures and raise alarms when signatures don't match.

Where is this not useful?  For a small company a locked safe is plenty.  
For a large company, you hire HR/Security folks to be your "Key Agents" 
or whatever.

Yeah, ditto.  We agree on this.  We also would want something sent 
offsite incase of nuke, flood, fire, or mass suicide. :-)  (sorry had to 
throw in a Heaven's Gate ref somewhere.)

Because there are laws that force such standards on the company.  So far 
are there any laws that say you can't use anything but DSA? (Or Clipper, 
or whatever NSA backed scheme d'jour is being pushed?)  If there were 
such laws in progress, they would be fought. :)

So we agree. :)

It would be cool by me to impose a minimum provided that the current state of
hardware could process such keys without too much of a delay factor, but not
a maximum.  If I am sick enough to want a 16384 bit RSA key, why force me to
use something lesser?

But within a company, were I insistent enough for whatever reason to use 
384 bit RSA keys, as weak as they are and that was my company's policy I 
should be able to allow it.  (Just as employers can read email if you 
expect that you have no privacy on the company email system.)

Ours is a bit more paranoid.  We offsite a tape on the 15th and last day 
of every month.  Every few months we burn a pair of CD's of the important 
stuff, keep one in the local safe, one offsite.

It helps (looking at my own flame resistant shorts...)
