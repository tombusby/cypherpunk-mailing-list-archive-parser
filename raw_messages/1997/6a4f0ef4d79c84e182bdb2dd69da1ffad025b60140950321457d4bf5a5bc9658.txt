Owing to a huge pile of mail messages on Monday (and perhaps my effort to
process them faster by running smap without smapd) some messages to mccain
have had the following destinations:

    ordinary inbox, bypassing procmail

    procmail to the wrong recipe, (you may have received
    an info message)

For both of the above I still have the mail in a backlog of about
200 messages that will be getting sent RSN.

I am unable to determine whether any mail was lost.  Sorry about the
possibility of this, and the delay some messages are experiencing.

I have increased the POOLSIZE of mccain from 3 to 4, and reduced
the RATE from 100 to 90.

The tea remailer does not seem to have hit the same problem, perhaps
attracting less traffic by lower performance stats.
