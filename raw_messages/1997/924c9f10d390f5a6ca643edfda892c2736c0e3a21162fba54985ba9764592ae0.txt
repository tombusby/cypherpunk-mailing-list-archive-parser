Personally, I just responded to one persons statement, (the one with the
modicum of courtesy) and decided to let this looser languish, (because of
his foul additude).
I think that by this, maybe, he'll learn not to bite the hand of the persons
who he is asking for help from.
It also gives me a none too innocent feeling of graditude to know that this
person will suffer a little longer, all because I decided that I didn't like
him.
