The producers of the show had better hope that it is not evidence of
complicity in a murder.

Let's say Tim is crazy.(*)  He told us how much he enjoyed seeing the
BATF agent take one in the face.  If this were to inspire him to try
the same thing in real life, how would the producers of the show be
less guilty than the talk show host?

After all, the most intense and graphic aspect of the episode was the
scene where the BATF agent was killed.  The people who made the show
obviously intended this to have the most impact.  It must be the
actual point of the show.  (It's well known that television watchers
are far more responsive to imagery than boring dialogue.)

The rest was obviously a cynical attempt to undermine the machinery of
justice by appearing to be on the side of law enforcement.  Bad People
try this trick all the time.  Fortunately, the jury usually isn't
fooled.

I'm looking forward to the miscreants getting the justice they so
richly deserve, aren't you?

(*) Tim seems too wiley to be crazy.  Instead, he seems to be playing
The Most Dangerous Game: Fed baiting.
