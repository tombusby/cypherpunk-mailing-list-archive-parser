Please be advised that the message sent to the cypherpunks
list purporting to be from Carolyn Turbyfill <turby@pgp.com>
was a forgery. 
The PGP signature on the file, apparently from Marc Briceno
<mark@digicash.com> may have been a forgery, as well, since
it is unlikely that Marc would know whether or not Carolyn
wears panties. It may be that the forger quite simply made
a lucky guess.

Oh! Not that I've been peeking up the women's skirts at
the office. I'm in therapy now, and all of that is behind
me. I must have just heard it from someone else in the
office.
Not that we're a bunch of perverts who sit around talking
about that kind of thing, mind you.

(I'd better shut up while I still have a job.)

Oh! I know. This message must be a forgery, too. Yes, that's
it...this message is a _forgery_! It's not me writing it,
its that sick, demented, cypherpunk forger.
I'm not backsliding. I attend all the meetings and I am
taking my medication regularly.

It's the _forger_, I tell you...the _forger_!!!
