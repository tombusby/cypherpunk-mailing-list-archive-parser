If you have received this electronic mailing by mistake, please pardon our intrusion.

Greetings,

Have you or somebody that you know experienced the humiliation of a collection agency calling at work or at home? They always seem to know when somebody is sitting at your desk or visiting your home when they call.

Millions of collection telephone calls and letters are made or sent each week to people who owe money. Those of us who owe money will pay our debts and do not need the help of a collection agency hounding us at our homes or place of business. Consumers have been helpless to stop the harassment of these predators, UNTIL NOW!

Our hard-hitting report 'Stop Collection Agencies Cold (C 1996)' will show you how to put an end to those telephone calls and letters, INSTANTLY! At the same time, the collectors will be forbidden to EVER call or write you again!!

'Stop Collectors Cold (C 1996)' is a brief, concise report that will tell you everything you need to know to stop the harrassment forever and comes to you with a 100% money-back guarantee! This report is normally $49.95, but if you act WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS, you will pay only $18.00 plus $1.95 S&H.
