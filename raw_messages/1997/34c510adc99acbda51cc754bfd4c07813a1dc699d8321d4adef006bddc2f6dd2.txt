Attn: you fell victim to this persons abuse of Internet E-Mail. You can
help stop him by doing two things: 1. do NOT use his service. Find
somewhere else to get photos scanned. 2. Forward a COMPLETE copy of his
message with all headers intact to
postmaster@aol.com,abuse@aol.com,tosadvisor@aol.com,stevecase@aol.com,root@a
ol.com
This will make sure that AOL knows you do NOT want to receive this persons
crap, and they will shut down his account.
Thank you for listening, and help stop SPAM!
