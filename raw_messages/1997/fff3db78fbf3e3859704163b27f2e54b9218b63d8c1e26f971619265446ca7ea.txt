That is correct. A moderated newsgroup can be set up such that messages
coming from certain addresses can be required to be digitally signed.
This requirement, of course, does not have to apply to all users and can
be done on a voluntary basis.

Anonymous users can also enjoy the benefits of authentication, if they
submit their public keys to the moderator (with the key address set
to something like space@alien.nowhere) and request that all messages
coming with the address "space@alien.nowhere" be authenticated.

This is a very positive aspect of moderated groups, since anonymous posters
can enjoy both anonymity and reputation.

The other concern here seems to be forgers who forge valid addresses of
existing users. Again, a moderated group has a great flexibility to 
introduce SOME authentication without even the need for using public
key cryptography.

The moderator can set up a password-based system. Anyone can request a 
password sent to them by sending an email to password@moderation.site.com.
A unique password will be generated, stored and sent back to the
requestor. The address that had been assigned the password gets on the
"watch list" and all article submissions from that address would be
checked for presence of the password. Of course, a password needs to be
wiped out from the message priot to teh approval.

As long as email remains private (ie, there is no man in the middle or any
sniffers acting), this scheme is secure. Again, it may be either purely 
voluntary or mandatory.

Of course, anonymous users need special treatment since they are unable to
receive email. Such users may continue to use PGP.
