No wonder the EPA and every other bureaucrat is stocking up on weaponry of
all kinds...Almost everyone in America is an anti-government extremist hate
group member.  Here is some "hate speech" from a Dead White Guy(tm) to ponder:

"They tell us we are weak--unable to cope with so formidable an
adversary.  But when shall we be stronger?  Will it be next week, or the
next year?  Will it be when we are totally disarmed?  Shall we acquire the
means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging
the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies have bound us hand and
foot?  We are not weak if we make a proper use of the means which the God
of nature has placed in our power.  Millions of people armed in the hold
cause of Liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are
invincible.  Besides, we shall not fight our battles alone.  There is a
just God who presides over the destinies of nations, who will raise up
friends to fight our battles for us.  The battle, is not to the strong
alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.  Many cry 'Peace,
peace'--but there is no peace.  The war is actually begun!  Why stand we
here idle?  Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the
price of chains and slavery?  Forbid it Almighty God!  I know not what
course others may take; but as for me, give me Liberty or give me death!"
 -- Patrick Henry

"If ye love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude
greater than the animating contest for freedom, go home from us in peace.
We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that
feeds you. May your chains set lightly upon you; and may posterity forget
that ye were our countrymen."
-- Samuel Adams

fulfill their potential."
