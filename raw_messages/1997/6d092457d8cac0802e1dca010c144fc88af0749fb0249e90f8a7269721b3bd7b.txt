That wouldn't be the way it work -- Jim operates one of the cp 
remailers; I operate another.  Jim has a standard policy concerning 
public domain/copyright that is different than mine.  So *I* put an 
X-distrib-policy header in all the cp mail I forward to him.  More 
precisely, all of my incoming mail for "cypherpunks@songbird.com" 
gets the header.

This protocol needs a bit of refinement, and perhaps some hacking at 
majordomo, but seems fairly straightforward.

Jim's policy is actually very reasonable.  It has a rational basis, 
though one might disagree with it, and it is easy to deal with 
it this way.  A more extreme policy -- "The operator of this mailing 
list claims an exclusive copyright on every piece of mail sent to it; 
by sending to it you agree to this policy", for example -- would be 
harder to deal with.
