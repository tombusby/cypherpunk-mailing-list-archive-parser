That won't work for two reasons:  First, Gary is now "cloaking" his
posts with an "X-No-Archive" header to keep them from being archived
by neutral parties such as DejaNews.  In addition, if you do a
search on his name as author in the old database, you get a bunch of
matches that say "article not available", indicating that he's
requested that such articles be removed from the archives.  Second,
how does one search for something that was never posted?  The only
thing I see in the Deja News archives is Jeff Burchell's explanation
of Burnore's $cientology-esque attack on his remailer:

Thus far, that's the best explanation I've seen for Gary Burnore's
threats and harassment.

True, but the chance that somone might be offensive is not
sufficient reason to censor it.  (If that were true, Usenet
references to Whitewater might be declared "pornographic" by the
Clinton administration.)  Gary Burnore keeps whining about posts
from "ANON assholes" not just "assholes" in general.  That
definitely reveals something about him.  If he were to gripe about
posts from "black assholes", one might (rightly) conclude that he
was a racist.  If he were flaming posts from "gay assholes", you'd
probably figure that he was a homophobe, right?  The fact that he
doesn't flame the CONTENT but some characteristic about the author
marks him as a bigot.

You've got a point there.  <g> I don't place much faith in what I
see in the From:  line, even if it appears to be a valid e-mail
address.
