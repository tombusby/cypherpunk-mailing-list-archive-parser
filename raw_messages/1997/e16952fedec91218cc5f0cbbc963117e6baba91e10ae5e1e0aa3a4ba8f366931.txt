What the hell is an "Emotionally stunted man", any way, Zooko?

I don't see what's fanatical about hating a government.

Question, Zooko:

Who the fuck makes gun laws, helps pass censor laws, anti-freedom and
encryption laws, anyway???

We don't *demonize*, we put the blame on the guilty.

Think about this, Zooko:

You are standing, along with your other sheeple, screaming, throwing
objects, at Tim McVeigh, with images of Flag-waving freedom-fighters
(terrorists, by government terms) behind his face.

THAT above should give YOU pause for thought, Zooko.

And that is what most of us feel.

Sacred Jihads who work to overthrow the U.S. government, in order to
establish a more libertarian one?

I consider anyone as being sub-human who bursts through my door, armed
heavily, and with intent to steal my possesions, and my freedom, and
my sovreignity over my house.

And I'm sure you'll be thinking the same thing one day if THEY bust
down YOUR door, and fire at your wife, holding a baby daughter of
yours.

If they come at your house with a tank, outside standing, are hundreds
of armed ATF agents.

If they come to steal your wealth, force you from your house, after
seeing your are an enemy of the people, destroy your possesions, and
force you to a concentration camp.

Think about it, Zooko.  Don't close your mind in the shroud of hatred
for those different from you.
