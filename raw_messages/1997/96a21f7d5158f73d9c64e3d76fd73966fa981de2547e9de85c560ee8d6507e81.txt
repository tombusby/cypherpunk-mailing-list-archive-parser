There is no change of stance needed, I happen to believe you are 
knowledgable about cryptography and sometimes post worthwhile 
commentary and information, however, you also post a lot of dreck and 
flammable material which means I respond in kind. That does not mean 
I believe you, or anyone else, should be censored.

I agree entirely, Gilmore was a respected man (despite the EFF being 
a corporate whore) who threw any respect and admiration others had 
for him away.

I notice and appreciate the quotes around "moderation experiment", 
this is, without doubt, a permenant measure to silence members of the 
list who dare to offer criticism of anyone an element of {x: x a 
friend or co-censor of John Gilmore}

I do not have the resources to run such an unmoderated list but I 
hope someone on this list does and is good enough to start such a 
list, cypherpunks is a shell of what it once was. 

Also, please note this message will be junked onto cypherpunks-flames 
even though it contains no flames or flame bait because it dares to 
criticise the censorship of the list (once again Sandy, I give you an 
opportunity to prove me wrong).
