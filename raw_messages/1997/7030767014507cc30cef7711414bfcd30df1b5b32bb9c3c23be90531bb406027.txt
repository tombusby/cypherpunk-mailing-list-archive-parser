As I, and a number of other list members, have said: Why did you not 
rename the lists so that cypherpunks@toad.com was uncensored???
You and I know perfectly well that probably 1250 of those addresses 
are people who don`t know the censorship is taking place, don`t read 
the list (defunct accounts), don`t know how to change their 
subscription, are too lazy to care either way etc... I would guess 
there are less than 100 that have considered the issues and decided 
to subscribe to the censored list.

No, it was usable to those with time and patience or the rather 
rudimentary knowledge necessary to set up filters. Now all we are 
doing is relegating a list that was once subscribed to by intelligent 
and well educated people into a playground for the inept. I`m not 
being elitist but if we can`t expect a member of this list who 
actually uses it for discussion to know how to set up filters then he 
might as well unsubscribe.

You should indeed have shut down the list. The problem being not that 
you choose to run a censored list but that you have associated the 
name cypherpunks with it and in doing so you have destroyed the 
reputation that the name cypherpunks once had.

Paternalism is the root of all statism.
