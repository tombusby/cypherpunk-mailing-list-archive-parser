10. Whenever you bury a bone, president digs it up and eats it.

	hairpiece.
	6. When the president says "Roll over," he's usually talking to
	his date.
	5. Roger hogs all the best chew-toys.
	4. If you so much as look at Janet Reno, you get an assfull of
	size-13 pump.
	3. Leash not as nice as the one Hillary uses on Bill.
	2. Unfair having to get "fixed" when Clinton's the one who
	really needs it.
