How does this follow?  It's purely a traffic analysis problem.  Has nothing
to do with cryptanalysis.

I dont understand how this follows either.

Don't be silly.  The crypto-radical bunch is not taken very seriously.  I'm
not saying they should be, but face fact.  Your ego aside, you must realize
that government just doesn't think that taxation is really threatened by
digital bearer devices.  They think its threatened by the jurisdictional
questions.  Period.

I've always believed they can't.

Believe me, e$ is not really on the map yet, and to the extent it is on the
horizon the person who will bring it to their attention has not bothered to
yet.
