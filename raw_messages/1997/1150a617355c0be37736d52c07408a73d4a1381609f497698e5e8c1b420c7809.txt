"Wednesday June 25 9:57 AM EDT

Clinton officials move to quash encryption bills

By Aaron Pressman

WASHINGTON - The Clinton administration this week is stepping up its campaign
to block Congressional efforts to ease strict U.S. export controls on computer
encoding technology.

A House International Relations Committee subcommittee easily approved
legislation on Tuesday to lift most of the restrictions on encryption programs,
software that scrambles information and renders if unreadable without a
password
or software "key."

Top administration officials, including Federal Bureau of Investigation
Director
Louis Freeh, will visit Capitol Hill Wednesday and Thursday to make the case
against relaxing export controls.

Freeh will testify at an open hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee
Wednesday
and provide House lawmakers with a classified briefing on Thursday. "
