I agree that draconian crypto laws are afoot, but I don't discount the
power of constitutional challenges.

So,

- the client who communicates with his lawyer must encrypt to the
government's key, allowing the government to read the traffic at any time

- the penitent who confesses electronically (such services already exist)
will be confessing to the government

- a patient and doctor who discuss private medical conditions will be
discussing them with the Thought Police

- a confidential source who reveals information to a journalist will also
be revealing it to the government

And so on, for the usual laundry list of problems with warrantless searches
and widespread surveillance. These are just some of the most
readily-understandable problems.

Will a "must encrypt to government key" provision pass constitutional
muster? I don't think so.

So long as the First and Fourth (and the Fifth may apply, too) Amendments
remain in force, compelling a person to speak in certain ways and
monitoring what he says privately without a proper court order is
unconstitutional.

At least the convoluted stuff in Clipper about "LEAF" fields, splitting of
keys between agencies, proper court orders, etc., had the "fig LEAF" of
protecting some basic constitutional rights. A straight "encrypt to the
government's key" is too crude to withstand any court scrutiny.

I'm obviously not a lawyer, let alone a constitutional scholar, but I think
I'm solid footing here.  A crude, blanket order to include the government
in all communications would absolutely be struck down as a chilling of
speech (political or otherwise) and as an unlawful search and seizure of
one's papers.

In other nations, ignore the above analysis.
