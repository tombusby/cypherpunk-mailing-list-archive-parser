Oh pooh. Spare us the spin doctor diatribe...

Anarchist are interested in protecting only their own person and
possessions over and above all other factors. Furthermore, it in no way
protects from oppression at the individual or social level. The only thing
it does is guarantee that I will have to spend a great deal of my income
on protection, most folks have something better to do with their time than
participate in a system that believes the height of personal achievment is
to sit around and stroke your gun looking for trespassers on their property.
Try explaining how an anarchy is going to better protect my right to free
speech or the economic and social stability required to carry on a business?

Democracy <> Mob Rule

Something you just don't seem to get.

A good measure of the oppressive level in a given government is to examine
who owns property versus who manages it.

Type:                            Owner:             Manager:

Communism                        Govt.              Govt.

Fascist                          Indiv.             Govt.

Democracy                        Indiv. <> Shared   Indiv. <> Shared

Anarchy                          N/A                N/A

Changes in this relationship seem to be a good measure. For example consider
the level of change in ownership rights before and after the changes in the
confiscation laws. If one thinks of speech as a commodity this also holds.
