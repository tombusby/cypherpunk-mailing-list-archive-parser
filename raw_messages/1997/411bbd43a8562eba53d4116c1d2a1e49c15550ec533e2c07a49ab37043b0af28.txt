Acknowledged, agree to disagree :-).  (Very few of my male friends
can do more than sew on a button, but that doesn't weight my choice
of a *professional* tailor.)  It did, however, sound like you were
agreeing with the previous poster's (more extreme) position.

Agreed (sadly) that there is a dearth of role models like Mme. Curie
or Roberta Bondar.

There is also an unfortunate "geek stigma" often attached to those
who are good at math or science (male or female). Whether this stigma
discourages more girls than boys is questionable (psychology thesis,
anyone?), but it has probably resulted in good-math-potential brains
taking economics (or whatever) instead.  Fewer competitors for the
56-bit prize, but also fewer brains thinking up better PRNGs.
