Speaking as a father and as someone who has been followed by gang members
on numerous occasions after witnessing a gang assault and providing
information to the police, I am in agreement with Tim May.  I don't want my
child to be corrupted or assaulted by worthless, predatory scum.  There
would be much less gang crime if private citizens could cane or otherwise
deal with gangsters when they caught them in the act, pour encourager les
autres, like.

What part of "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed" is too hard to understand? (From 2nd Amendment, U.S. Constitution)

When everyone is armed, criminals fear everyone, not just the police.
