The following article was on RISKS Digest.
Obviously it's not usable for cryptographic randomness,
since you can't trust the path to be safe from eavesdroppers
(even if you're using SSL/RC4-128, can you trust the far end?
or from denial of service attacks (so be careful about wiring it in),
but sometimes you just want a good-quality random number to seed things,
such as a simulation program, and it might not be a bad thing to
hash in to your entropy pool with locally-derived sources.

TBTF's 9 Mar 1997 issue carried this item:

#..Hot and cold running randomness
#
#    Perhaps for the first time, anyone with an Internet connection can
#    tap a source of true randomness. The creator of HotBits [16], John
#    Walker <kelvin@fourmilab.ch>, describes it as
#
#      > an Internet resource that brings genuine random numbers, 
#      > generated by a process fundamentally governed by the inherent
#      > uncertainty in the quantum mechanical laws of nature, directly
#      > to your computer... HotBits are generated by timing successive
#      > pairs of radioactive decays... You order up your serving of
#      > HotBits by filling out a [Web] request form... the HotBits
#      > server flashes the random bytes back to you over the Web.
#
#    Walker modified an off-the-shelf radiation detector to interface to
#    a PC-compatible serial port, and ran a cable three floors down from
#    his office to a converted 70,000-litre subterranean water cistern
#    with metre-thick concrete walls, where the detector nestles with a
#    60-microcurie Krypton-85 radiation source.
#
#    If you're in the mood for an anti-Microsoft rant of uncommon eloquence,
#    Walker can supply that too [17].
#
#    Thanks to Keith Bostic <bostic@bostic.com> for the word on this 
#    delightful service.

An interesting idea, but hopefully no will use it -- it is too easily
spoofed via DNS, and the host itself could be hacked to return the same
'random' number all the time.  (Maybe after we have IPsec, SecDNS, _and_ you
trust the host we could use services like this on the Internet).
