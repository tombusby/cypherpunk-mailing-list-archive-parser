 I have a close friend who is a therapist on several occasions had the
state and insurance companies try to force disclosure of materials on
certain patients. It has created such a dilemma that this person had
consulted with me to come up with not just encryption solutions but
steganographic solutions as well so that if this person's computer is
subpoenaed (sp?) they won't know what to look at/for. At the time, I
though the person was over-reacting, but in the ensuing eighteen
months, I am not so sure.
