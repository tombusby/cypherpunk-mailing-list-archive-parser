Before answering, ask yourself these questions!

Do I want to avoid points on my driver's license?

Do I want to avoid paying fines?

Do I want to avoid being forced to attend driver's 
education classes?

Would I like to show a foreign driver's license 
when I get stopped?

Would I like to show a foreign driver's license 
when I check into a hotel?

Would I like to show an International Driver's 
License to get admitted to night spots?

If your answer is "Yes!" to any of these 
questions, you need a Macronesian International
