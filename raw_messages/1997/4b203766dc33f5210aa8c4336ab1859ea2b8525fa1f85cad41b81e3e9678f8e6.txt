Happy Xmas from the Cryptix Development Team!   Here's the full story:


=======================================
For immediate release:

Cryptix 3.0 - the International JCE

23 December 1997 -- A major new release of Cryptix is now available on
web sites around the world. Cryptix V3.0 includes the International Java
Cryptography Extension (IJCE).

The cleanroom implementation of the JavaSoft specification was built by
David Hopwood and Raif Naffah, and also includes new algorithms by the
team, including the long-awaited unencumbered ElGamal public key
algorithm.

Cryptix includes the strong cryptography that is needed to protect
privacy and electronic commerce on the Internet. With this release, the
Cryptix Development Team is maintaining its committment to quality,
freeware cryptography.

In full, the Cryptix International JCE release supports:

       Symmetric
       encryption
                      Blowfish, CAST5, DES,
                      Triple DES, IDEA,
                      LOKI'91, RC2, RC4,
                      SAFER, SPEED, Square
       Message digests
                      HAVAL, MD2, MD4,
                      MD5, RIPEMD-128,
                      RIPEMD-160, SHA-0,
                      SHA-1
       Public-key
       encryption
                      RawElGamal GF(p), RSA
       Public-key
       signatures
                      RawElGamal GF(p), RSA
       Padding
                      PKCS#5, PKCS#7,
                      OneAndZeroes, NONE
       Modes
                      ECB, CBC, CFB,
                      CFB-PGP, OFB
       Miscellaneous
                      Base64 encoding

Cryptix now offers the widest choice in Java cryptographic solutions.
These benefits can be downloaded from the international mirror index
listed below.

A design goal of maintaining compatibility with Java 1.0.2 has been
substantially achieved, although specific Java 1.1 features and some of
the new algorithms (ElGamal and KeyGenerators) are not available when
using the older standard. This provides a smoother upgrade path to full
J1.1 and JCE functionality.

The international download mirror index is located at
http://www.systemics.com/software/cryptix-java/   The Cryptix
Development Team acknowledges the kind assistance of the many mirror
sites that permit widespread and free distribution of the product, to
maximum benefit of the Internet community.

David Hopwood <hopwood@zetnet.co.uk>, Raif S. Naffah <raif@fl.net.au>
and Ian Grigg <iang@systemics.com> are available to answer questions on
this release of Cryptix.
