This is, of course, a distinction without a difference. The point is that
NSA was very pissed off that Bidzos would hold up a Japanese chip in front
of Congress, thereby proving that export controls were hardly needed or
even relevant in today's world.

And, almost immediately, the Japanese RSA chip became "unavailable." A
longterm Cypherpunk, who can speak up if he desires to, had a few of these
chips in the U.S. before the NSA ordered Chobetsu/MITI to halt export (and
probably even to halt internal use in products developed for export). He
told me the chips had suddenly become "unavailable," with no apparent
prospects for them _ever_ becoming available. The stooges in Nippon listen
when their masters speak.

RSA the company may have various reasons for not pushing the issue too
hard. For one thing, pissing off the NSA (even more) may cut into business
contracts. For another, designing the Japanese chip into products could be
a dangerous thing, if the supply is uncertain (and winning one court battle
in Japan may not ensure continued supplies). Finally, recall that I
publically described threats by NSA agents to have Bidzos "run over in your
parking lot."

This is the way the Amerikan government works in this era of freedom. It
threatens to kill the chief executives of Amerikan companies who don't play
along with Big Brother's rules. It leans on allies like Japan and Germany
to crack down on crypto products. It ignores import and export laws at will
(as yesterday's "executive order" barring import of more rifles shows), and
it engages in New World Order/OECD/Wassenaar deal cuttings with other
tyrants. Oh, and it holds out the prospect of lucrative contracts to
Netscape, Intel, H-P, TIS, and other such companies if they "build in Big
Brother."

Yes, this fits my view that Nakatuji is either an American trolling the
list, or some "dark person" (in the Japanese hacker sense) connecting to
the Net with his "hotmail" account.

That his English is poor is not the real issue. There are plenty of people
with poor English skills. No, the issue is that he sends out short trolls,
first asking "what am Misty?," then offering to sell documentation on
crypto for money sent to him. And he never engages in discussion, broken
English or not.

I was quite serious when I said in a post a few months back that I'd done
some Web and Dejanews searches on his precise name string and had only
found some requests for "male pen pals." This is not a "homophobic" remark,
just a statement of what I found.

(I did the same search several days ago, as Nakatuji once again became news
here, and couldn't find any references at all to his exact name. Maybe the
sites or archives that carried his pen pal requests, if it was he and not
some other with the same name, had flushed this older stuff.)
