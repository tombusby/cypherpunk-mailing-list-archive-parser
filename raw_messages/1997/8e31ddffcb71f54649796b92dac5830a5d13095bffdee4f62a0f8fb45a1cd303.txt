  I don't think it would take an extraordinary amount of brainpower for
someone to be able to figure out that a posting with a subject heading,
"Make Big $$$" is auto-spam, and put it out of its misery.
  And 500 messages titled, "How about them Lakers, huh?" would probably
also be fairly easy for even the slow-of-wit to spot as
cyber-hemmeroids.
  If I am denied hearing about a new cryptography scheme because the
author of it named it, "How about them Lakers, huh?", I am sure that
it would be a loss that I could live with.
