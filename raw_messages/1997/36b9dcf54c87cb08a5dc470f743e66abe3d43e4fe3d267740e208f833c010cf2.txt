In our society, which, if I remember correctly, 10% of the population
control 90% of the wealth, AP would only lead to 10% of the population being
able to screw the remaining 90%.  At least as it is, it takes a simple majority.

As for the murder of the rich, here is a scenerio.

A collection of poor pool their capitol to have a tyrant killed.
The tyrant assembles a counter-wager saying that anyone able to prove thier
ability to kill him without harming him, and who can show they got through
will get 110% of the poor's bid.
The household is told that a standing bounty has been placed with a
collection of individuals, on the head of the trigger man involved in the
tyrants murder.
The poor can not hope to match the tyrants bid as they only have 10% of the
wealth, the household knows that thier participation in an attempt on the
tyrant will get them killed.  Even if the attempt was successful.
The people from the outside who would benefit from the bounty benefit more
by taking the tyrants offer and then trying again, i.e. tiger teams.
