PGP 5.x is interoperable with PGP 2.6.x as long as you confine yourself to
using PGP 2.6.x RSA keys.  When you encrypt a message to a mix of RSA
(2.6.x) and ElGamal (5.x) keys, you will get a message stating that if you
insist on encrypting to the ElGamal keys, then 2.6.x users will not be able
to read the message.

I agree that the licensing fees posted are outrageous, but at least PGP
Inc. did release the source code so you CAN live without their SDK if you
are willing to analyze it.  How many other companies release source code?
How many other companies release freeware products like PGP 5.0?  They have
to make a few bucks here and there to stay in business, although I think
they are pricing themselves out of the market with their SDK fees.

PGP Inc. is not the enemy, although maybe some of the folks there ought to
have their heads examined.  When they implement mandatory CMR/GMR/GAK and
stop releasing source code, then I will throw rocks, too.  Until then, I
will continue to use their products, and sit on my high horse and laugh at
their marketing folks...
