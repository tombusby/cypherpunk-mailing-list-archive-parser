	That is a ridiculous argument. The door to my home is connected
to the street,m and I know full well that that makes it easy for anyone 
to come wandering in to my home. Is it legal, just because I have my 
home hooked to the street, for someone to come in and help themselves to 
a beer out of my fridge?

	Nope. Sure I realize that they _can_, but that doesn't make it right,
and it doesn't make it legal.
