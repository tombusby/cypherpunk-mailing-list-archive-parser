 I used to think that way ... but then I thought, why pay all that money 
and walk the line of whatever Swinesteen et al come up with. Instead I 
have my deer rifles and a shotgun or two and ammo for both. The way this 
all is working now, I have more combat experience than 90% of the active 
duty military and most cops, and every day goes by more and more are 
retiring. If it ever comes down to that, I'll take down one or two of 
them with my deer rifle and help myself to their weapons and ammo ... 
also kind of makes sure I haven't set myself up to depend on an obsolete 
caliber ... if I am not good enough to take some of them down and take 
their weapons, no 300 nor 30,000 rounds for my very own Armalite is going 
to make any difference.
