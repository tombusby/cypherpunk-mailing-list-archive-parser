If you send the above message repeatedly, changing a single character
at a time, in increments (X0a1a2.../aXa1a2...) some interesting things
happen to messages encrypted to two keys, especially if they share a
one-time pad.
These 'interesting things' are wonderful tools for prying open the 
secrets of a foreign key, using what you already know about the key
you are in possession of.

If you happen to be working with an encryption program that unwitting
allows you to access the one-time pad it is using (or to *supply* the
one-time pad it uses), then you can crack secret keys during your lunch
breaks and still have time to complete a level of Doom before it is
time to get back to work.
