MIT probably has a need-blind admissions policy; they don't care whether or
not you have money. When they admit you, at least.

Let me plug Carnegie Mellon University, which consistently ties with MIT
and one of them California schools for first place in computer science.
It's not quite as hard to get into as MIT, though you do have to deal with
Pittsburgh winters. The town itself is small enough to be friendly, and big
enough to be interesting. Jim Morris, the head of the computer science
department, was my instructor for a data structures class and truly seemed
to care about his students' well-being.

Oh, and I remember we had t-shirts saying: "MIT -- the CMU of Massachusetts."
