Seems inherently dangerous to me, everything about you is on a system or 
systems somewhere, and most of them have used federal funds in their 
startup and continue to use them. Doesn't that grant the governments 
almost total access to your past present and future? I KNOW I don't want 
ANYONE having THAT much access to my life. What I don't understand is 
what makes them tjink we'll just roll over and accept this without a 
fight?

Seems to me that that is EXACTLY what the government wants. If they 
can't pass it legally, they figure they'll use economical pressure. 
Hell, they've been doing it to China, Vietnam, Russia and a host of 
others for years! Why shouldn't they apply the concept locally?

Isn't control of the economy too powerful of a tool for the government? 
Can anyone hear the whistling? It's the sound of the government sword 
slicing through our pocketbooks and into our liberties and rights.

Yeah, and how many of them does the government have pull with? Quite a 
few considering that they back most corporate companies with tax dollars 
and schools with federal grants.

This is starting to sound like the beginnings of a Martial State. Slowly 
control the population in every aspect of their lives and when you have 
enough control, who's gonna fight you when you really start cracking the 
whip? If you control everything that affects their lives, NO ONE! 
Control their economy, their privacy, their children, and you control 
them. Even better, get them to help you in the names of their children, 
their rights, and make them feel like thy are in greatr danger that they 
actually are and they'll just hand you the reins!  Hmmmmmm... doesn't 
this sound like our current situation??

How many times have we watched the better part of valiant, couragous, 
and honorable men and women be seduced by power, greed, corruption, and 
just plain old not thinking straight?

Yes, we vote. Yes, we care. Yes, WE WILL FIGHT!!!

Though referenced by it's government, a country is defined 
by it's people. For it is not it's government that makes a 
country, but it's people. The government is just a place to 
put the useless. :-)   God does have a sense of humor.... 
He forgave our sins, and gave us government for penance!
