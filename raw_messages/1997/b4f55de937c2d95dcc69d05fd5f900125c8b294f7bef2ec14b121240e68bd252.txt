Remember the Amateur Action BBS case from 1994, when Robert Thomas
got convicted by a Federal court in Tennessee for distributing pornography
on his BBS in California?  Well, he was also prosecuted in Utah 
for distributing pornography from the BBS (the Merc doesn't say if it 
was a state or federal prosecution, but it looks like state),
and he just lost his appeal in Federal court.  One of his defense arguments
was double jeopardy, and the court rejected that because the
Utah court busted him for different pictures than the Tennessee court.
While distributing child pornography is reprehensible, it's still
none of Utah's business; the ACLU lawyer defending Thomas says there's
no evidence that any Utah citizens actually downloaded any (except the
police).
