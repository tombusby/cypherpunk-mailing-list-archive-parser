Absolutly,

Tell the bastards nothing but name rank and SS#.

Last month a local conservitive talk radio host was bemoning the fact the
the Ramsey's were not cooperating with the police and why the police
couldn't just go down and make them talk to them. I called in and he was
quite shocked when I explained that:

1) Under the 5th Amendment one is not required to give any assistance to
the police in a criminal investegation.

2) That the Ramsey's were prime suspects after 48hrs and no suspect was
found.

3) That this was SOP for the LEA's to go after family members/friends of a
murder victim even though, on average, 1/3 of murders in the US are
commited by strangers and this figure is incresing.

4) He really should have known better. :)
