     For those with a strong stomach for testimony on the need to
     strenghten money laundering laws and extend know-your-customer
     requirements to non-banks, material from last week's hearings on money
     laundering and the drug trade by the House Judiciary Committee's
     Subcommittee on Crime are now on-line at
     http://www.house.gov/judiciary/364.htm
