  So we should only fight for other people's causes, and not
our own? Or not fight at all?
  It sounds to me like Jim Bell isn't the only one on the list
with his own drug lab. Did you bring enough for everybody, Phill?

  Well, I guess that now we know *who* decides.
  Send me a list of the "innocent" people, Phill, and I'll put
