You are missing the less well-documented, but equally classic function
of key management, which is a part of any useful crypto system.  The
key management part of it *could* exist as a separate program from the
encryption/decryption part, but they are *far* more closely tied than
word processing and accounting, and what you would have is a crypto
*system*, composed of several relatively tightly coupled programs that
share complex data formats.  Such a crypto system would be quite
useful, and would allow the construction of all kinds of other
products by using scripting languages.  However, the ergonomics of
such a crypto system would not be appropriate for the average point
and click MacWindows Moron.

I think you are quite off base here.  There is very little additional 
functionality added by CMR; and the enforcement *is* done by a 
separate program.

Nice try, but the bloat, if any, comes from the gui and other stuff, 
not the crypto functionality.  PGP 5.x, from a user interface point 
of view, is much simpler than previous versions -- it integrates very 
cleanly and unobtrusively with the system on the MacWindows platform.

Are you nuts?  Of course PGP, Inc, should be worrying about this kind 
of stuff.  They *need* new products to survive.

Fine -- you use your personal solution.  PGP, Inc is trying to 
provide solutions that work in an organizational setting, where 
forgotten passwords are a constant fact of life, and where the 
security issues are vastly different from your situation.

If they want to survive as a company, it is.

Just precisely what is their core business, Tim -- supplying freeware 
to Cypherpunks?

"If it is claimed..."? Of course it is claimed -- it's a fact.  And
yes, there is a major educational battle -- ivory tower cypherpunks
have to educate themselves about the nature of the world.  You
believe, apparently, that large organizations contemplating crypto are
just misguided or duped by evil governments into doing the devil's
work.  Until you actually grok what is going on you will never be all 
that effective in dealing with it.
