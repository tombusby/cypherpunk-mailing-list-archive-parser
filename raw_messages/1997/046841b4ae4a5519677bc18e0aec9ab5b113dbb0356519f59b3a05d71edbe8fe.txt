It isn't a rationale, its reality. This view is not moderated by political
or ideological beliefs but the harsh reality that things don't work the
right way all the time.

Your implied base assumption is that the reason is always the same. I
seriously doubt it.

The process is so simple it ain't funny. I believe, but won't guarantee it,
that we are all using a procmail script to remove duplicate messages, and
that is all the 'distributor/reflector duplicate-filter algorithms' there
is. Unless one of the other repeaters is doing something more complicated
they haven't said. In short, you are under the misconception that this is
something special, it ain't.

SSZ receives traffic from the other remailers at cpunks@ssz.com, just a
normal user account, which has the procmail script filtering duplicates. It
then forwards to cypherpunks@ssz.com, which is the majordomo managed list.
cpunks@ssz.com as well as the rest of the subscribers get their traffic from
here. If the procmail breaks then I get a mail loop at SSZ and my box fills
up and lets me know pretty quickly something is broke because majordomo
recognizes this through the X-loop: and kills them in that case as well as
sending postmaster (me) all kinds of nifty hints. The other sites in this
case still filter duplicates so things still don't run away.

Sounds good to me...<shrug>

No, SSZ has full inbound and outbound traffic queing for up to 4 days
or the hard drive fills up here and at my ISP.

ps The ISDN was apparently moved to a new pair. It seems rock solid at
   this point...time will tell.
