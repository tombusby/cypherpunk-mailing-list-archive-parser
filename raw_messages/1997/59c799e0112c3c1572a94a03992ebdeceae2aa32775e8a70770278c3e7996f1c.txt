I_Love_SPAM,

     Pardon the intrusion, I hope you dont mind. If you find
     that you could perhaps use some extra cash, then feel free
     to read a little further. No hype just a simple opportunity.
     If not then hit the cancel button NOW as I do not wish to
     invade your privacy any more than I have done so already.
