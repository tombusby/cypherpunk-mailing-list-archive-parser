This is simply untrue.  In several instances I have argued against the
use of violence as impractical.  (It's also distasteful.)

Incidentally, who is it that should be creating articles that express
your beliefs?  Since you haven't seen the quantity of articles
opposing violence that you would like, perhaps you wouldn't mind
telling us why you haven't been writing them?
