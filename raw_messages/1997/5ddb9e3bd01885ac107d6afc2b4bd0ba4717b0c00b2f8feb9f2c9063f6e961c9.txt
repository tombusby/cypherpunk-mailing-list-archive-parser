Hey developers,

Don't miss out on the new capabilities of Microsoft's latest versions of
the Visual Tools you depend on--including a brand new suite of tools
called Visual Studio 97 development system.

Microsoft has just introduced the following tools, each with new features
and enhancements that can improve both your efficiency and integration
with the Internet:

* Microsoft Visual Basic programming system 5.0
-- Combine fast development and execution with the new Native Code
compiler.  Visual Basic is the most efficient tool for creating
high-performance applications that integrate client/server technology with
Internet technology.

* Microsoft Visual C++ development system 5.0
-- This is the most powerful language for developing high-performance
applications and components.  Now, run everything faster, including
existing code, with this version.

* Microsoft Visual InterDev Web development system
-- The newest member of the Visual Tools family, this integrated
development tool for building Active Server Web applications increases Web
developers' productivity and makes it easy to develop dynamic,
database-driven Web sites.

* Microsoft Visual J++ development software
-- Create great 100% cross-platform Java code, or integrate it with your
databases and existing applications.  Put the powerful Java debugger and
the fastest Java compiler to work for you. All this in a flexible,
familiar IDE that is shared with Visual C++ and Visual InterDev.

* Microsoft Visual FoxPro database management system 5.0
-- With improved performance, existing applications run up to 40% faster.
This object-oriented development tool is the best way to build all types
of database applications.

But that's just the beginning -- Microsoft has even better news.  If you
use more than one Microsoft Visual Tool, you can get a value-priced suite
of all five products for just about the price of two: Visual Studio 97.
With it, you'll be prepared for any development challenge, from
Windows-based solutions to Internet development to the most complex
client/server applications..
