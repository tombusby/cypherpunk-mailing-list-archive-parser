FCC ADOPTS NOTICE OF INQUIRY ON CALLING PARTY PAYS
==========================================================
http://www.wow-com.com/professional/whatshot/

As expected, the FCC adopted a Notice of Inquiry examining Calling Party
Pays (CPP) as an option for subscribers to Commercial Mobile Radio
Services, and as a  potential means of promoting competition with
wireline carriers. All four of the  Commissioners expressed support for
the item, characterizing CPP as a "pro-competitive idea that deserves
greater attention."  Read about this and other Hot issues in WOW-COM's
What's Hot.
