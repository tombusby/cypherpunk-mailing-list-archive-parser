This reminds me of a story that happened 5 or 6 years ago to a sovok
who used to be a dentist back in Russia. He couldn't become a dentist
in the U.S., so he became a stockbroker out in the midwest. He lost
some money for another sovok. Sovok #2 asked sovok #1 nicely for a
reimbursement, but he refused. So, he killed him and ran his body
through one of those tree mulching things. They never found much of
sovok #1's body. However sovok #2 was so stupid that he stole #1's
Rolex watch and was seen wearing it, so he got arrested and even
convicted.
