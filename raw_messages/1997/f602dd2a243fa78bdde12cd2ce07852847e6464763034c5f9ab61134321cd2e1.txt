Its that time again folks.

I am starting to put together the 3rd Mac Crypto/ internet commerce workshop.

The dates should  be around the last week of Jan 98, most likely at in
Apple, Cupertino, (unless something changes)  This year looks like it will
a really
hot ticket.

>>>>>>>>  I am looking for folks to talk, papers etc.. <<<<<<<<<

This years goals are to:

1) Provide a place for developers to learn how they can embed crypto
support into thier MacOS / Rhapsody products today.

2) Give developers a chance to show off some of the work that has been
done in the past year.

3) Plan what needs to be done and talk about product oppertunities.

4) Give the developers a chance to tell Apple and other vendors what
they want to see in the future.

to see what we have done the past two years,  please check out the webpage at
http://www.vmeng.com/mc/ . I should be posting a preliminary schedule,
formal announcements and registration  form shortly.
