As of March, 1997 Consensus Development (www.consensus.com) stopped
licensing RSAREF for a very reasonable amount (~$200 US + 2-3% range I
think it was??) 

Consensus' "SSL Plus" toolkit requires licensee to also license BSAFE from
RSADSI. 

Maybe too many people were using commerical RSAREF licenses rather than the
BSAFE toolkit.
