This article has lost a few very critical lines,
making it look far worse than it really is.

Network Associates was _not_ formerly known as the
Key Recovery Alliance.  They were formerly known as
McAfee Associates.  McAfee had been a member of the
KRA, but has since withdrawn.  Go see PGP's home page.
And Phil's comments about user consent don't mean that
users _should_ be forced to consent -- viewed in context, 
they mean that users shouldn't have their keys or
messages escrowed without their consent,
and the escrow features should require consent.

Furthermore, peer-reviewed encryption isn't dead -
the OpenPGP encryption standard is being developed,
bringing PGP to an open standards process.
