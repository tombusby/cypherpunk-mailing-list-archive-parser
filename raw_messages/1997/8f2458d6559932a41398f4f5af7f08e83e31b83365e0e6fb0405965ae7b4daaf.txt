Chamber of Commerce represents professional businesses on the Web.

        The Adult Chamber of Commerce is on the Web to help you!

    We got your E-mail address from your Business newsgroup posting.

THE BOTTOM LINE: Chamber members see increased traffic to their Web Sites.

A massive portion of the Web has Doctors, Lawyers, Accountants, and all sorts
of people (buyer) visiting ADULT sites.  It's just the nature of the Web.

Your business can capture some of this massive traffic and direct it to your
Web site through Membership in The Adult Chamber of Commerce.  All member
companies, Adult & Non-Adult, get listed in the Chamber member links section
with an icon that indicates you do business in accordance with the Better
Business Practices of The Adult Chamber of Commerce.  This listing literally
guarantees significant additional traffic to your Web site.

Membership inThe Adult Chamber of Commerce is something you should consider
if you are interested in getting greater exposure on the Web.

Each company is checked out before membership is approved.  Since it costs
a business as little as $240 annually for membership, it's not expensive
for a company to tell others that they support the only professional
organization for responsible ADULT businesses.  A business applies for
membership at the Adult Chamber Web site and visitors regularly check to
see if the company [they'e planning to buy from] is a Member in Good
Standing.

      The Adult Chamber of Commerce web site is the place to find
           the BEST & most responsible companies on the Web.
