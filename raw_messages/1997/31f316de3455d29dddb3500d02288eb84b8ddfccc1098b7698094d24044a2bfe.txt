 Subject: Why no coverage of CA resolution on Encryption?

 Why was there no coverage of CA State resolution SJR-29?
 
 I find it using the search facility at:
 
     http://www.sen.ca.gov/www/leginfo/SearchText.html
 
 And the result is at:
 

http://www.sen.ca.gov/htbin/ca-billpage/SJR/29/gopher_root2:[bill.curren
t.sjr.from0000.sjr0029]
 
 The on-line magazine has a full article by Will Rodger on this:
 
     http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/daily/970908b.html
 
 Apparently there was some attempt by the Clinton Administration to
 cover up their lobbying effort.  I don't understand why the
 Administration would care about a California state RESOLUTION of all
 things.  Why does the Clinton Administration want to prevent a state
 legislature from speaking its mind?
 
 And what's with this attempt to claim "copyright" on that fax?
 
 Please get some answers on this!  The US Senate/House will be voting
 on important encryption legislation in the coming days.  The people of
 this country deserves to have a open, informed, serious discussion of
 one of the most important privacy issues of the information age.  We
 cannot afford to let a few intelligence and law enforcement agencies
 dictate policy TO us against our will.
