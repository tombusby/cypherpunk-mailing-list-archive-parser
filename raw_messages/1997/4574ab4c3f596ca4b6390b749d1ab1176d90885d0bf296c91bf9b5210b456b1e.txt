Would people want to use eudora (their main email program) as a remailer,
and have to wait for it to process all those messages each time they read
their mail?  Is there a demand for users with dial-up accounts to be
remailers?

(I'm not being critical, I'm just asking.  I never thought about using
eudora as a remailer server)

Yes, I was thinking along these lines, though right now I'm concentrating
on the client end of things.

Good Idea.  Are people comfortable with not choosing the exact order of the
remailers used?

And how does one tell the difference between a JPEG image and a executable
program after they're uuencoded (assuming one does not follow MIME
conventions)?  Will we be required by law to identify, in clear plaintext,
the nature and contents of all our messages?

One more  thing:  I can't seem to find any reference to an API for pgp 5.0.
Anyone have any pointers?
