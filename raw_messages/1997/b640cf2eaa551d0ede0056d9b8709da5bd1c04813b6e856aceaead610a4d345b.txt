The problem is burden of proof.  You made a claim with no evidence or facts
to back it up.

You made the statement that PGP >2.5 was comprimised.  When asked for
something more that assertion, you go off on a screed.

Are you retracting that claim?  Do you have something you want to share with
the rest of the class?

Unless you have something to back up that claim, we will treat you like any
of the other loons ranting about black helicopters, the Greys, and the rest
of the FUD.

Believe it or not, I am trying to deal with the thread you started.  It might
not be the subject you want to address, but hey, you are the one who opened
his mouth...

If you are going to spread rumors, you might as well, as least have something
to back them up.

An oxymoron if I have ever heard one...
