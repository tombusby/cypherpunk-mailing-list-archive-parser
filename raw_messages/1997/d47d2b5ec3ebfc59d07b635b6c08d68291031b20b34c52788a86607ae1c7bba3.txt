You're denying that you, Belinda Bryan, and William McClatchie are staff members
of DataBasix?  Are you denying that McClatchie used unproven allegations of 
"forgery" as his excuse to campaign to get the upstream providers of Jeff 
Burchell's "Mailmasher" server to disconnect him?  Do you remember McClatchie's
post which said:

Did you catch that -- "asking that mailmasher be shut down"?  Have your forgotten 
the time McClatchie was asked this question:

And then there's Jeff's account of what followed.  Do you remember when you 
asked him:

You said that it was the "anti-remailer front" that was using this alleged 
"abuse" to get remailers shut down, but McClatchie was the one named by Jeff 
of playing that very role.

I'd like to hear more about this "anti-remailer front" you speak of.  Thus far,
you've claimed that all the anonymous posts that have criticized you have all 
come from the same person.  That doesn't sound like much of a "front".  How about
some more NAMES?  Who else is involved in this "front"?

Posting REPORTS of disinformation is not disinformation.  You have posted
no proof for any of your disinformation.  For example, your unsubstantiated
claim that someone (you actually accused someone by name) of sending abusive
e-mail, via a remailer, to an unnamed "teenage girl" who supposedly had a web 
page at DataBasix.  Where is your proof of that accusation?  Saying that an
anonymous person "abused" an unnamed victim is pretty flimsy, don't you think?

Then Belinda Bryan came along and claimed that this same person had supposedly
forged posts through an anonymous remailer in the names of "every known email 
address of DataBasix staff and  customers".  Again, no evidence that it even 
occurred, nor even an explanation of how someone OUTSIDE of your company would 
get ahold of that kind of confidential information!

You're forgetting Mailmasher and McClatchie's hissy fit to get it shut down?

Free speech is now "harassment"?  (Only in the world of DataBasix!) If you didn't 
want people talking about the things you've done, you shouldn't have done them in 
the first place. 

Exactly what "harassment" are you alleging?  You mean posting replies to you and
answering the questions you asked?  You whine for "proof" then scream "harassment"
when it is posted.  Cute.

You obviously have a short memory.  Your letter to Jeff Burchell demanded that
he turn over his logs to you identifying everyone who had sent and received
anonymous e-mail through his remailer.  This was MONTHS after you whined about
alleged "forgeries" and were told about having your name blocked upon
request.  Unless you deliberately avoided taking the advice you had been given
then blocking your address would have been a non-issue by June, since you were
whining about "forgeries" in February.

Or are you talking about your attempt to get posts that even MENTIONED your name
in the body blocked?

Claims?  I asked a QUESTION. What use did you have in mind for Jeff's remailer
logs which you demanded?  Since you refuse to answer, let me repeat Jeff's
theory.  If it's incorrect, please feel free to correct it:

Go back and reread the post.  It was the power to demand that Jeff turn over (non-
existent) logs to you and Belinda that you didn't have.  The rest makes no sense, 
because it's quite obvious that the remailer is SHUT DOWN.
