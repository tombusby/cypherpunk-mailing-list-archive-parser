Basically, the law of causality starts to catch them up.  Money is 
an expression of Man's Reason, expressed through it's productive 
abilities. Since taxing is always coercitive, it goes against individuals's 
best judgment.  So, when there is nothing to physically coerce, they loose the 
ability to tax.

"Economic Potential", Newspeak for "confiscation of production to finance 
other's peoples dreams".  And they 
realize that if they don't clamp on it *now*, it'll go through their 
fingers like fine dry sand.  

"To explore the [...] issues": Newspeak for "to bully the 
Freedom-of-e-commerce groups", Newspeak for "to figure out a way to keep 
milking them without killing them".

How in the hell tax policies will "protect" the electronic commerce?  
Easy: just the way the Mafia used to "protect" commerces from burning 
up...

Newspeak Master.

Newspeak for "how to keep milking, or rather, keep bloodsucking them without 
killing them?

And accessorily,   how exactly does it work?  In a totally non-private way.  
So, *naturally*,  businesspersons will want to protect their privacy.  But 
how in hell is the govt be able to do *any* monitoring of transactions if the 
transactions are encrypted?  Duhhh...

Note to Unicorn: how does 2+2 ?    :-)

Peoples on Death Row are more lucky:: they don't get coaxed to weave their 
own hanging rope...

Why concede them their screwed-up, leech mentality basic premises? 
In no way should we engage in this discussion.  All we need to do is to 
expose our basic premises and say that the case rest.

I.e. there is only one way to make us swallow their Newspeak: to dazzle 
us with their fancy and rhetorics in order
 to make us abandon our basic premises.

But will we?   :-b
