Gary North has been predicting apocalypse on the y2k subject
for awhile. but he has a lot of data to back his claims.
this talks about the IRS computers and predicts they're going
to collapse.

>document I have ever seen.  I had read a brief news story about a 
>company that had applied for a contract to work as a subcontractor for 
>the IRS in a restructuring of its computer systems.  The IRS admitted to 
>Congress last January that its $4 billion, 11-year attempt to modernize 
>its computer systems had failed.  Here was a follow-up story.  So, I went 
>to the company's Web site to find more information.  This led me on a 
>merry chase across the Web.
>
>     Finally I landed on the IRS's page -- specifically, its page relating 
to 
>its PRIME project.  There were pages of blue links to documents, each 
>one with a strange name or the name of a state.  It was not clear to me at 
>first what I had discovered.  So, I started clicking links.  I found nothing 


>that I could understand, link after link: government bureaucratese.  
>Then I hit pay dirt: the mother lode, my friends -- what we have been 
>waiting for since 1913.  Deliverance.  Free at last, free at last!  THE 
>IRS'S MAINFRAME COMPUTERS -- 63 OF THEM, PLUS 
>MICROCOMPUTERS -- ARE ON THE BRINK OF TOTAL 
>COLLAPSE.  Yee-hah!
>
>     This amazing admission appears in an innocuously titled document, 
>"Request for Comments (RFC) for Modernization Prime Systems 
>Integration Services Contractor" (May 15, 1997).  The author is Arthur 
>Gross, Associate Commissioner of the IRS and Chief Information 
>Officer, i.e., the senior IRS computer honcho.  It was Mr.  Gross who 
>went before Congress in January to admit defeat.
>
>     Mr. Gross now says that the IRS is no longer capable of operating its 
>own computer systems.  The IRS has over 7,500 people involved in just 
>computer maintenance, with a budget a $1 billion a year (Appendix B. 
>p. 2), yet they can no longer handle the load.  And so, says Mr. Gross, 
>some of them are going to get fired.  You can imagine the continuing 
>morale problem that this announcement will cause!  The IS (information 
>systems) division will be, as they say, DOWNSIZED.  From now on, the 
>IRS must achieve the following:
>
>           . . . shifting the focus of IS management to a
>           business orientation: servicing customers with
>           exponentially increasing technology needs,
>           implementing massive new technology applications
>           on schedule within budget while managing the
>           downsizing of the IS organization
>           (Appendix B. p. 2).
>
>     Do you think that people slaving away in their cubicles, trying to fix 
>the Millennium Bug, will respond favorably to this notice?  "Fix it, and 
>then you're out!"  Mr. Gross knows better.  So, with this amazing 
>document, he calls on private industry to come in and TAKE OVER 
>THE ENTIRE IRS COMPUTER DIVISION.  This is what Mr. Gross 
>calls "a strategic partnership" (p. 1).  The new partners will have to fix 
>the Millennium Bug.  The IRS will give them exactly eight months, start 
>to finish: October 1, 1998 to the end of June, 1999.

>
>     Perhaps you have had trouble on occasion getting information from 
>the IRS about your account.  After reading this document, I now know 
>why.   The information is held in what the IRS calls "Master Files" (p. 
>4).  These files are held in the Martinsburg, West Virginia, computer.  
>This computer receives data sent in by 10 regional centers that use a 
>total of 60 separate mainframes.  These mainframes do not talk to each 
>other.  Or, as Mr. Gross puts it, they are part of "an extraordinarily 
>complex array of legacy and stand-alone modernized systems with 
>respect both to connectivity and inoperability between the mainframe 
>platforms and the plethora of distributed systems" (p. 4).  This is 
>bureaucratese, but I do understand the word, INOPERABILITY.
>
>     The tax data build up in the local mainframes for five business days.  
>Then they are uploaded to West Virginia.  This may take up to 10 actual 
>days.  Then the Martinsburg computer sends it all back to the regional 
>computers in the Service Centers.  Then the information is made 
>available to the "Customer Service Representatives" (p. 5), i.e., local tax 
>collectors.  The elapsed time may take two weeks.
>
>     But . . . it turns out that the actual source payment documents are not 


>sent to the Master Files.  Neither is "specific payment or tax 
>information."  This information stays in what the IRS calls 
>STOVEPIPED SYSTEMS, meaning stand-alone data bases "which, for 
>the most part, are not integrated with either the Master Files or the 
>corporate on-line system, IDRS" (p. 5).  Separate tax assessments for the 
>same person can appear in six separate systems, and these do not 
>communicate with each other (p. 5).  "Further, each system generates 
>management reporting information which is not homogeneous, one with 
>the other . . ." (p. 7).  To help us visualize this mess, and much larger 
>messes, the document includes charts.  These charts are so complex that 
>my printer was unable to print out the 116-page document -- probably 
>not enough RAM.  I had to get two other people involved to get one 
>readable copy.
>
>     I have included one of these charts on the back page, just for fun.  Go 


>ahead.  Take a quick look.  No need to get out your magnifying glass 
>just yet.   Then comes the key admission: "These infrastructures are 
>largely not century date compliant . . ." (p. 11).  The phrase "century 
>date compliant" is the government's phrase for Year 2000-compliant.  In 
>other words, THE IRS'S COMPUTERS ARE GOING TO CRASH.  
>Now hear this:
>
>          In addition to three computing centers, (Memphis,
>          Detroit and Martinsburg) the latter of which is a
>          fully operational tax processing center, the IRS
>          deploys a total of sixty mainframes in its ten
>          regional service centers.
>
>          None of the mainframes are compliant, thereby

>

>

>Got that?  It took five years for them to fix 6 million lines.  But the IRS

>
>     Consider the fact that they have not completed their inventory.  The 
>1996 "California White Paper," which is the y2k guide issued by the IS 
>division of the California state government's y2k repair project, says that 
>inventory constitutes 1% of the overall code repair project.  Awareness 
>is 1%.  So, after you get finished with inventory, YOU HAVE 98% OF 
>YOUR PROJECT AHEAD OF YOU.  Meanwhile, the IRS has not yet 
>completed its inventory.
>

>free.
>

>revenues in 2000?

>

>programs.  These computers must interact with each other, unlike 
>today's system.  Bear in mind that some of this code -- I have seen

>not understood by most programmers today: perhaps 50,000 of them,

>
>     Beyond the magnitude of the applications system migration, the 
>complexity and enormity of the date conversion that would be required
