Again, I am only on the Flames list. So why was this message sent to the
Flames list? Because someone responded to a Vulis post? Is a response to a
Banned Message now grounds for rejection?

Here's the message sent to the Flames pile. Although the anonymous author
did not add much, neither the original message nor his/her one line
response was a "flame" or "insult." Hence it should not have been rejected.
