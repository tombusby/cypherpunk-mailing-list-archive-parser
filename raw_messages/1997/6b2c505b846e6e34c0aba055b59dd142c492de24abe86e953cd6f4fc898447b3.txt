For access to the 5,000 items declassified under NSA's OPENDOOR
program (http://www.nsa.gov:8080/programs/opendoor), we got 
this answer from the National Archives:

Dear Mr. Young:

This is in response to your electronic mail inquiry of December 20, 1996,
concerning National Security Agency records transferred to the National
Archives.

The material described on the NSA web site was transferred to the
National Archives and made available in April 1996.  We can supply you
with electrostatic (paper) copies of select files for $0.25 per page. 
Please let us know which files you would like copied, and we will send
you a reproduction price quote (please include your mailing address with
all such requests).  We ask that you limit each request to five files.

Should you choose to come to Washington to do research, our records
and microfilm publications are available for consultation without charge in
our research room.  The National Archives at College Park (Archives II),
is located at 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland.  If you do not
have a research card, you must apply for one in the reception area. 
Research room hours (except legal holidays) are 8:45 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday and Wednesday; and 8:45 a.m. to 9 p.m., Tuesday, Thursday
and Friday.  Our subject matter specialists are not on duty after 5:15 p.m.
 The research rooms also are open on Saturday from 8:45 a.m. to 4:45
p.m., with a small research room staff present.  Requests for records
must be made before 3:30 p.m. Monday-Friday; no requests can be made
on Saturday.  The telephone number for the Archives II Reference
Branch is 301-713-7250.
