Man, Igor, you really hit that on the head.  My "blowing things up" 
days are long over.  That was 20 years or more ago AND 50-75 pounds.

I say "Leave that to the younger ones, who think they are 
indestructable, anyway"

I've got a nice condo, a wife who is straight arrow, and a bigger 
bank account than I had in the militant hippie daze.  I would, 
however take up arms for the cause of state's rights.  I love my state 
far more than my country, even if I am a Nam vet.

Of course I do considerable fire power at my disposal.  All legal, by 
the way (at the time of this writing).
