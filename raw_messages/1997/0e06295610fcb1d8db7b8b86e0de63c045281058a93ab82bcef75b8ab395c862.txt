Hi, everybody!
My son is going to make two voluntary projects for his school. 
Tentative title of the projects are:

1. Transfer of military technologies to civil life. It is about technologies 
like microwave oven or diapers came from space stations, or automatic 
transmission first invented for tanks. 

2. Russian scientists/inventors worked/working in the USA (like Sikorski, or 
inventor of TV).

I am wondering if somebody  knows any good sources of information on the 
matter.

Many thanks in advance.
