L E F T  B R A I N / R I G H T   B R A I N  -  QUESTIONAIRE
_________________________________________________

 My name is Gregory Raymond and I believe you are someone who is 
 interested in a successful lifestyle.  By this I mean a balance of physical,
 mental, spiritual and financial success. If we are of a like mind, 
 I thought you might be interested in taking the following brief, 
 revealing quiz. Simply [hit reply] then place an "X" in the appropriate 
 boxes where applicable, and send it to us.


 I know and understand there are two parts to my mind, conscious 
 and sub-conscious (aka unconscious)

 Yes [  ] -  No [  ] -  Maybe [  ]  - Didn't Know [  ]

 I know the sub-conscious part of my mind labors 24 hours a day 		
 (without sleeping)   for my success or failure, without making any 
 moral judgements.

 Yes [  ] -  No [  ] -  Maybe [  ]  - Didn't Know [  ]
 
 I realize that by taking control of my subconscious mind, it's
 energy can be harnessed to accomplish whatever I desire.

 Yes [  ] -  No [  ] -  Maybe [  ]  - Didn't Know [  ]

 I might be interested learning more about using my subconscious 
 mind to  attain a  successful balance of physical, mental, and 
 financial success.

 Yes [  ] -  No [  ] -  Maybe [  ]  


[  ]    You have piqued my curiosity, and without any obligation,  I would like 
        to learn more  about achieving mental, physical and financial success.

[  ]    I'm not interested in this ridiculous survey, and with my CONSCIOUS 
        MIND,  I think that you're "Full Of It".  Take me off your list and 
        never darken my E-Door again.

Thank you for your time.

Regards,

Gregory Raymond
