Windows 95/NT, MacOS, FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, AIX, and right now I need
to deal with OS/390. 'Nuff said on the OS flame...

I probably should find it amusing to read such nonsene by people that
don't know what they are talking about, but frankly, I just find it
annoying.

PGP released their UNIX code the same day they released  their Windows
code. I know. I was there. I have 7 volume of source on my shelf to
prove it. Hurt my back lifting several boxes for re-distribution...

That it took so long before the source was available was due to the US
export laws. [The Windows and Mac source still  isn't 100% proofread].

BTW, how many pages did *you* proofread? Thought so. I
organized a 30 man tent full of proofreaders to get get stacks of
pages full of assembler proofread. By the end of the weekend, the
source was up for ftp. Your contribution to the project was...? 'Nuff
said on this topic.

You have/are going to contribute how many man months of highly qualified
programmer time to make PGP 5 fully stable? ... Right...I see.

Compatibility mode is not yet implemented. Are you voluntering your
time?... Oh.... Hmm..

Anyway, I got to go and get some work done. Been nice talking with you.
