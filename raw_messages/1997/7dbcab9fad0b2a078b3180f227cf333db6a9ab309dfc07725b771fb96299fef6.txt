Don't know specifically where the taps are, but there is a major network
access point (NAP) in Reston or Maclean VA.  There are other NAPs
located domestically. Some urls to look (by no means inclusive) that
will provide NAP information are:

	www.ra.net
	nic.merit.edu/ipma
	www.rsng.net/naps.html
	www.mfsdatanet.com/MAE/doc/mae-info.html
