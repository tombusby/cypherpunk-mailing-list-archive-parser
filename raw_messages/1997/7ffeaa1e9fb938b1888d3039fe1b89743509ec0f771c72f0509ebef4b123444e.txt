This is one of the point that I address in my article in the February 1997
issue of "Internet Underground" magazine (to which I am a contributing
editor). Here's an excerpt, since the magazine is just starting to hit the
stands.

---
The debate swirling through Capitol Hill conference rooms and the
corridors of the White House revolves around one basic question: What role
should the government play in regulating encryption?

The founding fathers might be startled by the byzantine rules. After all,
some revolutionaries were cryptographers themselves. Benjamin Franklin in
1781 crafted a substitution cipher based on a 682-character French phrase.
James Madison created a code replacing words with two- and three-digit
numbers that he used until 1793.

But by far the most remarkable cryptologist of the Revolutionary War was
the author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, who
between 1790 and 1800 invented a cipher system so far ahead of its time
that it remained in use even into the late 20th century.

The Codebreakers is also a good source.
