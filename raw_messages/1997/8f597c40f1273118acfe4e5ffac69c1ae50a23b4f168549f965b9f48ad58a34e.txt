  I will preface these comments by saying that I run two boxes here a
Power Mac, on which I do most of my work, and a WinNT4/Linux dual boot
box as well.

On 12/22/97 4:50 AM, Secret Squirrel (anon@squirrel.owl.de)  passed
this wisdom:

 or a Mac (admittedly not as many hybrids or mac-only titles)

>Want to install a new image in your Flash RAM on your motherboard? 
>DOS (Windows 95).

   on a Mac? who needs it?

>Want to have vendor-produced drivers? Windows 95.

   or a Mac

>Want to parse MS Turd documents? Windows 95 and MS Office.

  MacLinkPlus translators (bundled with OS) handles all WinDoze docs
(often better than WinDoze itself!)

>Want to use a Windows-specific bullshit class registration system

  (ugh!)

  most of the top manufacturers have Mac drivers. Epson printers even
come with Mac and PC interefaces built in

  same answer as above MacLinkPlus translators

 point, to you, but, the aim is not to produce an extra 500,000
CompSci educated users. It is to provide a useful tool for the masses.
Windows (who stole its interface from mac who stole it from xerox)
type GUIs are easier to use than CLIs, it is only since the
entrenchment of GUIs that they have come forth in the Unix/Linux
world.

 another point to you. as a high school teacher in an area where there
is a large IBM plant (read that as a lot of IBM employed taxpayers). I
watched with dismay as more and more IBM and compatibles have grown to
take over the lab. We have a fulltime hard wired Internet connection
from the state of Vermont and yet its all but useless half the time
because of one windows problem or another. The lab coordinator spends
more time fixing WinDoze compatability problem than teaching computer
use.

 PGP5 Mac came out early also
