<<   no insults or bashing, i promise
 
   the use of the built-in Random function looks scary.  my five minute
 overview of the code may have missed some cleverness (or i may have missed
 your own implementation of Random).  i am not a cryptographer, and can't
 comment much more on the actual encryption algorithms you're using
 
   from an engineering standpoint: i assume that you stripped the comments
 out before posting the source
 
   from a legal standpoint: you should probably yank the source code off
 of your site.  i am not a lawyer, but making this stuff downloadable from
 outside the US is risky >>

Hi. Sorry, actually, I regret that the code was developed with no inline
comments. Yes, you probably did skim over some essential code. Also, again,
the pseudo-random number generator is NOT the only method used to encrypt a
file. In fact, the pseudo-random number generator code could have been left
out to some extent. I have also specified that that no one who is not in the
U.S. may access the source code, but if no one cracks the file located at
http://www.dataet.com/public/source/vsacmv20/crackit.dat by June 20th, 1997,
I'll have to assume that VSA2048 is an extremely secure encryption algorithm,
and I will consider having the source code removed from the site.
