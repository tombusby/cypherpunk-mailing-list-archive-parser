Declan and Shabbir,

I thought it might be helpful to your dialouge to give you the ACLU's
current views about SAFE. The language significantly limiting the
criminalization provision was indeed drafted by EPIC and the ACLU. Don
Haines and Dave Sobel did a great 

The language was an improvement , but it doesn't belong in the bill and we
are still lobbying to have the criminalization provision removed. 

All of us in the cyber liberties community need to watch this legislation
very carefully. It could easily get much worse as a "compromise" is reached
with the Administration. In the end,the bill could be laden with amendments
on issues like key recovery that defeat our purpose of making strong and
secure encryption generally available.

At some point, we may need to say that no bill is better than a bad bill.
