JYX

3 August 1997

This site, JYX.COM, was set up on July 26, 1997 to substitute for 
JYA.COM which vanished on July 24, 1997, and thereby denied access 
to the site's architectural and public services. For a week technical 
and sales personnel of the ISP for JYA, AOL/PrimeHost, could not 
explain the disappearance.

On August 1, 1997, AOL/PrimeHost representative Steven Graham 
stated that JYA.COM had been "intentionally pulled" for undisclosed 
reasons. Mr. Graham's telephone: (703) 265-4464.
 
Reinstitution of JYA's architectural and public services should occur 
shortly, either by restart of JYA.COM with PrimeHost, or via another 
ISP. In the event that AOL/PrimeHost pulls JYX as well, announcement 
of alternative hosting and reasons for the change will be made on 
several mail lists:

   <cypherpunks@toad.com> 
   <cryptography@c2.net> 
   <ukcrypto@maillist.ox.ac.uk>
   <cyberia-l@aol.com>
   <design-l@psuvm.psu.edu> 
   <wam-l@arch-mag.com> 
   <the several Spoon lists @jefferson.village.virginia.edu> 
   <wire@monkey-boy.com> 

   and other lists and news groups as appropriate. 

This site is hosted by PrimeHost, which provided excellent service 
for JYA.COM for a year -- until now with this mysterious vanishing 
action.
