This seems straightforward enough in principle.  It's just
like a prepaid credit card, or even a normal credit card,
right?  I mean, what it says on the card is probably
different, but the financial arrangements are pretty-much
the same.  I suspect it would be easier to implement this
(at least in the US) as an extra function on a credit card,
rather than as a new kind of insurance, since there are so
many odd insurance regulations out there.  Currently, lots
of credit cards offer special benefits like automatic
insurance on rental cars--this seems like a close variation
on the same idea.
