If I understand you correctly,....

Nym servers when requested to "fixed size" documents to be forwarded may have
what appear (upon initial decryption) to be two messages in one package.

One RSA message -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----- lkflsd ----END PGP MESSAGE-----
is bundled with -----BEGIN GARBAGE MESSAGE----- dsujds ----END GARBAGE
MESSAGE----- both
within an IDEA encrypted message. One decrypts the IDEA message, deletes the
gargage, and uses his secret key to decrypt the PGP message.

Wiser folks will tell us if it is possible to have two true PGP messages in
one "bundle." I don't see why not.
