:>Subject:      Major security flaw in Cybercash 2.1.2
:>To: BUGTRAQ@NETSPACE.ORG
:>
:>CyberCash v. 2.1.2 has a major security flaw that causes all credit
:>card information processed by the server to be logged in a file with
:>world-readable permissions.  This security flaw exists in the default
:>CyberCash installation and configuration.
:>
:>The flaw is a result of not being able to turn off debugging.  Setting
:>the "DEBUG" flag to "0" in the configuration files simply has no
:>effect on the operation of the server.
:>
:>In CyberCash's server, when the "DEBUG" flag is on, the contents of
:>all credit card transactions are written to a log file (named
:>"Debug.log" by default).
:>
:>The easiest workaround I've found is to simply delete the existing
:>Debug.log file.  In my experience with the Solaris release, the
:>CyberCash software does not create this file at start time when the
:>DEBUG flag is set to 0.
:>
:>The inability to turn off debugging is noted on CyberCash's web site
:>under "Known Limitations".  The fact that credit card numbers are
:>stored in the clear, in a world readable file, is not.
