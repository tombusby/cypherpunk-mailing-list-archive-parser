Not my point, I didn`t say I would refuse, as in my example, to have 
my car serviced by a woman, rather, that I would not feel comfortable 
doing so. This is not prejudice, it is a statistical judgement based 
on the fact that, as a percentage, I know few women who are competent 
car mechanics but I know a number of men who, by the same criteria, I 
would call competent.

Very much so, I did not intend, even though my post may have appeared 
that way, for one minute to suggest that women were *unable* to carry 
out certain tasks, just that they seem less suited to certain 
vocations that others. For example, I know a number of good female 
History or English students but very few good female mathematics 
or computer science students. This is not, I believe, because women are 
not "suited" to computer science rather that they have never been encouraged 
at high school etc. to learn about such subjects which are seen as male preserves. 
I wholeheartedly believe this should not be the case, and my original 
post may have been misleading, I just believe that in the current 
system very few women do become good at science/technical subjects.
