I know this isn't directly cypher related, but oh well.

An award winning film, "Waco: the rules of engagement" is now
available on video.  Previously running at Art Houses and Film
Festivals it was produced by a few revolutionary media people.
Somehow it occurred to them that all the right-wingers had beaten
them to the punch making civil rights abuses known to the public.
Can't have any of that now, can we?  Why should *they* have all the
fun?

Anyway its been lauded as a very well balanced work.  Not like those
other people -- talking about evil, new world order conspiracies. ;-)

Probably most noteworthy is the included FLIR FBI footage (Forward Looking
InfraRed) which, under expert scrutiny, appears to show LEFs raining
automatic fire down on citizen units trying to escape the final
conflagration.  Here expert scrutiny is defined as the head of research
for the army night vision development group.

Its definitely the cure for those times when GAK starts looking like
reasonable, sensible and prudent alternative. 

I have absolutely no involvement or monetary connection to these
people.  I just wish they would have put it on video first.
