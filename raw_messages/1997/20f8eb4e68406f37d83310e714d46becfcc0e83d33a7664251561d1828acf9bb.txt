I talked to the guy who made the documentary (Duncan Campbell) an hour or two
ago, he's sending me the transcripts when he gets back to the UK.  I'll see 
if I can get his permission to post them to the web.  He's been doing this
sort of thing for about 25 years, and has some really neat stories to tell 
about his run-ins with the UK government.
