I just would like to give a special thanks to Alex and those at replay.com
for the invaluable service that they provide.

For those of you who think that their service only helps those outside the
US you are wrong. For the past year IBM has refused to publicly release
the 128bit version of the Netscape Navigator for OS/2 domestically. Just
this weekend someone uploaded this program to replay.com making it
available not only for those overseas but those of us here in the US.

Omce again Thanks!!
