I have worked out a plan whereby we can auction off the role of
Cypherpunks Chief Spokesperson in order to fund CAP's.
The idea for a Spokesperson pyramid scheme came to me after
realizing that the list has not only a variety of individuals
competing as the chief list 'Fed baiters', but also quite a
number of people who enjoy 'Christian baiting', as well:

There is no telling how much money we could raise by appealing to
the macho male egos on the list who lock horns in CypherPissing 
cock-size wars, if we were to take bids on the honor of being the
Cypherpunks' authorized 'Fed-baiter' or 'Christian-pisser', etc.

Given the wide variety of individuals, groups, organizations, 
corporations, government agencies, etc., which have been the
target of vicious attacks on this list, there is no end of the
number of CypherPisser Ambassadorships we could invent to fill
the Cypherpunks Action Projects coffers.
