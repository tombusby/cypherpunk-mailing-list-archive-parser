Out of curiosity, is anyone familiar with WinKrypt by Syncronsys?

I picked up a copy & there is no mention in the documentation which
encryption algorithm it uses & what the key lengths are. FWIW, my 
impression is that the documentation seems to deliberately avoid
mentioning the algorithm/key lengths.  Hmmmm.  (food for thought)

I was curious how it compares to McAfee's PC Crypto which uses 
40-bit DES or 160-bit Blowfish (user-chooses) & other PC/laptop
encryption products.  BTW, I would also appreciate your input 
on any crypto products which you believe to be robust, easy-to-use 
& secure.  (I know I can only have 2 out of 3, but it's worth a try 
anyway).  8^)  

Please send marketing info to me directly at: frankw@in.net and 
**NOT** to the entire mailing list.

(BTW, I mentioned WinKrypt & PCcrypo because they are the only
two which are available at many computer stores as COTS s/w).

TIA for your help.

Best Regards,


Frank
