True, if that's what the friends actually said, and if they were
not induced to do so by being fed lethal information: don't
go down with Bell, protect yourself, spill your guts.

Recall that John Painter spoke to one or more of them
and they hedged the remarks of the complaint, but he,
too, saw the makings of a deal in the affadavit's allegations.

Turning friends against friends is pretty common in
investigations, using threats and promises of relief
from possible charges, even saying that your friend is
squealing on you.

I was struck by how similar some remarks attributed to
Bell were to those attributed to McVeigh, not that they
were not made, but that the investigators chose to
select just those to indicate lethal intent. 

The possible link between the McVeigh trial and Jim Bell's 
bust could indicate how the feds are itching to attack
every advocate of anti-gov mayhem (no pun Tim).

The IRS searching the Internet for incriminating advocacy 
is a warning of what's to come, as often predicted here.

Time to study and ponder the 1st Amend -- which, by the way,
Matt Blaze did at the NYC crypto forum last night to challenge
Charney and Denning. Matt pulled out a copy and cited
it, which may be a good indication of what he knows that
we don't about what's coming.
