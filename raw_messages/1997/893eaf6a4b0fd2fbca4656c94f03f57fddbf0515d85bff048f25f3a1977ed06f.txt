Declan:

Interesting piece.  I made a somewhat similar point about how the
"siliconaires" (nice coinage) are manipuating the crypto debate at the
expense of those making pure privacy arguments.  This was in an article
focusing mostly on a slightly different topic: this idea of the "market for
privacy." Knowing your faith in markets, I doubt we'll agree on this one,
but you may find my critique interesting -- and worth mentioning to the
list.  Given the news on P3 and OPS, the "market solution" will no doubt be
discussed at the FTC hearing this week.
