Is there any offline newsreading software for linux?  (Something to
grab feeds from an NNTP server of selected newsgroups to put in
/usr/spool/news/, and something to queue posts for posting via NNTP
when on line)

(My difficulty with USENET groups is that we have pay per second phone
bills over here, and online USENET reading is inefficient, that plus
propogation delays).
