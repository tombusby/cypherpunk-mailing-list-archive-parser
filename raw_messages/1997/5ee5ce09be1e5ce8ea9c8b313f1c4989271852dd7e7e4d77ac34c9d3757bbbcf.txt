Retrofitting the stonger encryption (e.g., IDEA) to some existing GSM
phones may be practical (as I've discussed in previous postings), but
unless the service providers support the stonger crypto (seems very
unlikely at the moment)parties at the other end of the line will need an
Eric Blossom-like device or a laptop running PGPfone.  I can see no way
around this.

I may be wrong, but the faster laptops are already able to support the GSM
codes and rates in PGPfone (or could).  However, most of the service
providers may only be offering 9.6kb/s GSM data links at this time, and
this would surely impact voice quality.  If or when 28.8kb/s data is common
via GSM voice links via PGPfone should be better than the default GSM coded
voice.
