Which orthogonality are you speaking of?

Are you talking linguistics, philosophy, or computer? Consider, historicaly
the point of 'orthogonality' was to indicate a  *non-overlapping* or
reducable structure, something which provides a reference to evaluate other
things.

Orthogonal implies there is intersection, it's hard to have a closed
geometric shape (-gonal) or a right angle (ortho-) axis system without them.

Good, I understand how it is used in vector spaces and don't really get my
jollies off on arguing on unrelated issues. What I *would* like to
know is how a mathematical term related to geometry and right angles got
expanded *historicaly* to mean something completely unrelated. I don't think
a linear algebra book is relevant to this question, despite the protestations
of the techno-masturbatory ot the contrary.

There are a whole host of users on this list who live by strawman arguments.
I am glad to see you aren't one of them (apparently).
