Great. Thanks. Looking forward to seeing what you get.

Personally, I'm becoming convinced that SET is practically Ptolmaic in it's
complexity. You can get money from point A to point B, but you have to go
through a lot of epicycles to get there.

Transactional shovelware, maybe. Not unlike a lot of digital signature
legislation out there.

Unfortunately, I think that no MIS manager will get fired for using SET, and
it'll take a serious demonstration of a security breach before people will
listen to anything else. At least until someone demonstrates a transaction
protocol which is, say 3 orders of magnitude cheaper...

Cheers,
