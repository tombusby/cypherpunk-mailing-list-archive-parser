C'punks,

I'm ending my participation in the moderation of the list.  It 
would have been an interesting experiment if list members had 
been open minded enough to give it a good faith effort.  Instead,
those who weren't even willing to give another approach a try, 
set out to sabotage it and destroy any possibility of a meaningful 
test of the concept.  I see no reason to prolong the agony.

I've asked John to take me out of the loop as soon as possible.
If he can't get that done right away, I'll continue to moderate
in some capacity so that list members aren't cut off.  However,
I'm going to take a break today to help a friend move into her
apartment.  There won't be any messages forwarded for the next
24 hours or so.  Hopefully, John will have things switched over
by that then.  If not, I shove whatever is in the queue on down 
the line.
