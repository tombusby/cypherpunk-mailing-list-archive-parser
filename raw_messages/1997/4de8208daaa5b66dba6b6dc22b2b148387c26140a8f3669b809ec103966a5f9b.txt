	Well, if you can't deliver mail because their mailbox is full, then
you should simply wait a few days before trying to deliver mail to that
address. If it's because the address isn't there any more, you should delete
it from the subscription lists. Otherwise, the instant people's mail quotas
overflow (e.g., they're on AOL and they haven't been able to get through the
clogged lines), they get bounced... or you're left with a lot of invalid
addresses. The address causing the bounce is not necessarily determinable
automatically from the bounce message; if it isn't, then you need to keep a
copy around for a human to look at.

	Given that there are pre-existing news-mail gateways, I'd think that
the programs should be available. My concern on the programming is more in
the realm of keeping the thing up and running.

	Understood; my busy-ness with other stuff comes from being a grad
student.

	Looks OK. I'll also take a look around for what information I can
find.
