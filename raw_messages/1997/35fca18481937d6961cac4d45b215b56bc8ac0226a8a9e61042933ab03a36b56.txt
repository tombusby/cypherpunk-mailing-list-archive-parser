No I totaly disagree. Parents have *Rights* in reguard to their children.
It is the STATE who has privilages and is abusing those privilages.
Children do not have the same rights that adults do under the constitution
(this is not to say that they have none). Should I be able to murder my
children because they have become inconvient? NO. Should I be able to
punish my child without fear of retribution by a bunch of nardoweller
bureaucrats who feal that a parent should never punish a child. YES!!!

They have NO right to do so! They are my children and I will rase them as
*I* see fit, not how you see fit, not how the church or the PTA sees fit,
and most definatly not how the scumbags in Washington see fit!! (Would you
trust Ted Kenedy to rase *YOUR* daughter???).

It's not a matter of an ideal society as the can never be obtained due to
the fact we all have different ideals on what that society should be.  My
point is that from the dawn of time since man climbed out of the trees it
has been the parents would raised & were responcible for their children. It
has only been recient with the advent of the Socialist that the belief that
children should be raised by the STATE in cookie cutter fasion.

No perhaps I should have worded it better. I was tring to highligh that
such STATIST beliefs were at direct odds with the the beliefs of freedom &
privacy that the members of this group advocate. I am more than will to
disscuss this topic here as it higlight those who believe in the "cause"
and those who just give it lip service. (hopfully making a few converts
along the way. <G>)
