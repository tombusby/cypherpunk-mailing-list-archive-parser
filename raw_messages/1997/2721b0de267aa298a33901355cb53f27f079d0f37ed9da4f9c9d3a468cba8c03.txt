: 	A client asked me today about where he could find evidence of the
: relative strength of different encryption algorithms, when all are
: restricted to 40-bit keys.  He assumed dot-Gov was going to restrict his
: export product to the 40-bit limit, but he wanted to provide the strongest
: security he could within that limitation.

There is a tiny technical wrinkle here -- the simpleminded approach is
to use a 40 bit secret key appended to a constant, the smarter
approach is to use some disclosed random data that, combined with 40
secret bits, produces a much longer key. It's like the salt in Unix
passwords.  The simple approach can allow an attacker to use a
dictionary attack. The smarter approach means that the algorithm's
full key length gets used.

So, for example, you have 128 bit RC4 in which 88 bits are random but
disclosed while the remaining 40 bits are still secret.

The only practical problem is disclosure of the extra random bits,
which the government expects the software to do. This is one of the
uses of the big chunks of random data that host exchange in SSL V3.
In earler SSLs they built the disclosed bits right into the protocol,
an explicit field for disclosing part of the key.
