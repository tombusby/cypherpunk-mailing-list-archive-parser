    despite the fact you are not telling us for what reason you want this
    signed (there will be a copy on http://www.DejaNews.com anyway), I'll 
    sign it for you with my 512 "signature key <attila@hun.org>" which 
    can be recovered from the MIT keyserver (or anybody else who tracks 
    them) or directly from http://www.primenet.com/~attila  --the key
    is also appended outside the signature block.

    expostulated to perpetuate an opinion:

>of your PGP key.

>Thank you very much.


>``I testify that I did see this MD5 checksum around Dec 16, 1997.
