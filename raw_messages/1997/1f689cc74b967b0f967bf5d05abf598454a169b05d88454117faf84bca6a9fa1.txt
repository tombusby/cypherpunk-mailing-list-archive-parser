It's hard to call; the Swedes do have an independent streak, at least 
at the national level. They're not in NATO, and have an independent 
defence, like Switzerland. They maintained (with mixed success) 
neutrality during WW2.

When I lived there (65-68', I was a kid), there was a strong and
popular anti-American sentiment, mostly based in opposition to
the Vietnam war. US deserters were given asylum, and I was taught to
identify myself as Canadian if the situation seemed appropriate (the
US embassy was bombed during my stay - made a mess of the front
hallway).
