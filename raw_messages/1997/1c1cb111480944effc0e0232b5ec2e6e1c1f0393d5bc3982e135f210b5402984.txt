No,

It is not difficult to find somewhere (Anguilla?) where remailers and 
cryptography are far less likely to be restricted than elsewhere, the US 
knows the pointlessness of trying to enforce proxy censorship services, 
so does most everywhere else since the XS4ALL fiasco, there is no way 
they can stop US citizens sending mail through mixmasters in say 
Anguilla, or some other small independent country, for example IOM.

I agree, but you don`t realise that once cryptography is spread far 
enough there can be no restricting it`s use. The law is an ass.

I think that finally the poloticians in D.C, London, Berlin and all the 
other major capitals have caught on, and realised that open availability 
of anonymity, security and strong crypto can only lead to crypto anarchy, 
they are *scared*, this time they are no longer do-gooding idiots, they 
are out to cover their own backs...
