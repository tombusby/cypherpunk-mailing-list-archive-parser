Sigh. While occasionally I am prone to fits of charity and altruism, today
is not one of those days. I shall leave it to someone more merciful than I
(such as, perhaps, the Marquis de Sade, or Attila the Hun) to explain your
error to you. Perhaps Marc himself will enlighten you, though, frankly, I
hope he doesn't, as this could provide much amusement over time.
