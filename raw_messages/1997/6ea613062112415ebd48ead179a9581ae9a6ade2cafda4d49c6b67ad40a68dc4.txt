I think your term "non-lethal attack" is poorly chosen - there are any
number of behaviors which can be characterized as such. Lots of people do
lots of non-lethal things every day. (In fact, some might express a
preference in favor of the non-lethal attacks.)

It's also easy to interpret the data we've got as suggesting that Jim liked
to talk big and take small actions - he certainly had the tools and the
information required to carry out a "lethal attack" were he inclined to do
so. But he didn't.

It might have been interesting evidence, had Jim been charged with the
murder of an IRS agent. Perhaps you can point to one of his essays in which
he discusses the use of stinkbombs? 

Even so, I think there's a strong possibility that the essay(s) would have
been inadmissible, had there been a trial. And the interesting question
with respect to the essays is not whether or not they demonstrated an
antipathy towards the IRS, but whether or not they can be legitimately
considered by any of the judicial/administrative bodies charged with
deciding Jim's fate.

He did not plead to "lesser charges", he plead guilty to both charges which
were brought against him.

And there's no "doubt" here at all - the government charged him with the
crimes they thought they could prove against him at trial, Jim and his
attorney agreed with that assessment, and was sentenced. Handwaving about
evidence which wasn't introduced to show "motive" for crimes he wasn't
charged with isn't helpful.

Does that matter? Do you think that we can/should restrict the freedom of
the many, many harmless loons because of the much smaller percentage of
loons who go on to do awful things? And who decides who's a loon? I'm sure
that both you and I fit some people's definitions of loons. Will we lose
our rights, to speak, to own firearms, etc?
