Yeah, but poor Ron doesn't have a criminal arrest record like Gary does, 
despite Gary Burnore's unproven accusations, "big lie" campaign, crank calls 
to the FBI, etc.  Gary's charges get more and more fanciful.  Did you read
the one where he accused Ron of abusing some "teenage girl" at DataBasix.
Not a shred of evidence for his lies, of course.  Fortunately for him,
Netcom harbors net abusers and Gary had to suddenly leave California for
North Carolina after his arrest in San Francisco.

And there's his faithful sidekick, Belinda Bryan <eridani@ix.netcom.com>, who's
now posting with this forged line in her headers:

> Organization: Boycott E-Scrub Technologies. The owner is an admitted spambaiter.

This is the same looney maroon netcop who whined when somebody started posting
a URL from the AIDS Action League advocating a boycott of Gary Burnore's
ex-employer, Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.  And then Gary has the
nerve to call someone "racist" and "bigoted"?

These two net abusers richly deserve their NetScum pages:
