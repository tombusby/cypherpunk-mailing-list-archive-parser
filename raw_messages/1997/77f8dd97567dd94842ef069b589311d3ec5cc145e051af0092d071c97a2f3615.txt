Some of you may remember my post to the list a while back wondering 
which, if any, authentication is taking place on commands sent to space 
crafts such as the Mars Rover. Well, here is the official answer: "We use 
a private network and keep the protocol specs secret, therefore we don't 
have to worry about a thing".

Dear Mr. Green:
I now have a response to your questions of authentication from one of our
Deep Space Network Operations Managers, as follows:

The commanding of any spacecraft is performed via a closed and secured
network not accessed by the internet or the public. Direct connections
provided by NASCOM connect the DSN sites to the project operations centers.
There is no other branches nor interconnections available outside this
circuit. Each project center determines the bit structure of each command
sent, and not even the DSN sites that transmit the commands are aware of
the format, protocols, etc. Command data is not stored at the sites to
avoid sending commands inadvertently to the spacecraft. As a matter of
fact, DSN policy is not to accept responsibility for manually sending
commands even in case of a disaster. And, even within this closed circuit,
command data is given the highest priority and treated as sensitive data
and the command subsystems receiving and transmitting this data have been
classified with the with the highest NASA security level.

I hope this answers your question.  Thank you for your interest.
