>>service. They contend that your usage has or will hinder the operation
>>of the telephone network.

>>It is my belief that internet usage will diminish if users were required
>>to pay additional per minute charges. The FCC has created an email box
>>for your comments, responses must be received by February 13, 1997. Send
>>your comments to isp@fcc.gov and tell them what you think.
