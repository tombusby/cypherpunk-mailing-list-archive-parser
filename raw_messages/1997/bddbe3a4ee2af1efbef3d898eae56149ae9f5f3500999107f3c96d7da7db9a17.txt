Re release:

http://www.jim.com/jamesd/tools.htm


An OLE extension to visual basic, written in C++,
providing elliptic curve cryptographic operations, SHA1 
and big true random numbers to visual basic

I have re released the cryptographic extension to Visual Basic 

This release is thoroughly tested, and I have therefore raised
the version number from beta to 1.0

I have added visual basic program that tests and demonstrates the 
KongTools functions to the release.
