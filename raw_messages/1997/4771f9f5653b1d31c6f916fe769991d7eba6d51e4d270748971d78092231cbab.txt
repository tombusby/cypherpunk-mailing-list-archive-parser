Protection of Valuable Information

Over the past few decades, there has been a considerable shift in the area
of protection and exploitation of valuable information.  In the past, the
relevant skills were exercised by governments to protect or exploit
military and diplomatic information.  Nowadays, much of the interest in
information protection is by individuals wishing to protect their
privacy and by organizations wishing to protect their financial interests.

Here are the that come up that are worth some thought:

- does the breakup of the Soviet Union significantly reduce the
exploitation of U.S. Government information?

- has the world wide spread of ATMs (Automatic Teller Machines)
led to a great deal of electronic theft - and, if so how are they
protected?

- is cryptography more important than careful handling of information
and is cryptanalysis more important than burglary, bribery, and
blackmail?
