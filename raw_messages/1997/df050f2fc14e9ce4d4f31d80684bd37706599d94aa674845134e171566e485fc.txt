The information below is believed to be of interest to you.  If not,
I apologize for the intrusion. If you have any further questions, please
send me e-mail and I will reply promptly.  I'm here to help!


Over 80% of all Americans suffer from bad marks on their credit. I did.
If you don't, that's great!  Read no further.  But, if your credit is
marred by mistakes in the past or errors on the part of the bureaus,
read on!

It doesn't have to be that way. You have the RIGHT to have negative
information removed in many instances. My partner and I have put together
an easy to read, easy to use manual that will explain your rights and may help
you restore your credit to A+ status. Why pay an attorney $2,000 or some 
credit counselor $500 or more to do exactly what you can do for yourself?

For less than $15, you can help yourself to better credit. We'll give you
all the tools you need and explain exactly what to do.  This is not "credit
reversal". You won't have to lie to anyone or obtain a fraudulent tax id
number like many of the "instant credit repair" scams out there advise you
to do. It takes some work and perserverence, but you will be able to clean
up old marks and there are even techniques to turn current bad credit
accounts around!  And, it's all legal and EASY.

You've probably seen other offers or similar credit repair packages that
promise overnight results. Anyone who promises a quick overnight fix is
*lying* to you. It takes time and perseverance to fix your bad credit. 
But, it can be done!

There are also people out there who promise to help you establish a new
credit file. THIS IS ILLEGAL - Don't Do It.

-------------------------------------------------

the law! Our system WORKS! Our credit repair manual will show you step by
step how to do it yourself - and it's not hard to do!

If you would like your name to be removed from our list, please e-mail
"relia@juno.com" and put "remove" in the subject line.  We purchased a
mailing list of folks who should be interested in various products that
we produce, but mailing lists can be wrong, and we don't want to take your
time again unnecessarily.  Thanks for your help!
