My local server (news.demon.co.uk) recognised my newgroup for 
alt.cypherpunks and it was immediately visible, I don`t know how far 
it propogated or where Mikes took effect but whatever the 
distribution we seem to have reached most main news servers.

What else?

No, It was rmgrouped because the cmsg had no charter, I posted this 
to see if the Cabal would respond.

Quite so, I recieved mail the next day from a member of said clique 
telling me he "considered rmgrouping alt.cypherpunks.announce" 
because it was unmoderated. Needless to say he got a stern talking to 
for that one ;-) I guess I just have to much of a partiality for a 
little whisker tweeking ;-)
