for the cleaning and protecting of the Windows, cockpits,& Jet Fighter
Helmets, as well as many other uses in the Avionics industry.

The cost of the product was to expensive for the average consumer so
it was never retailed, Until 1996 when one of our employees came up
with an alternative for one of the Main ingredients.
