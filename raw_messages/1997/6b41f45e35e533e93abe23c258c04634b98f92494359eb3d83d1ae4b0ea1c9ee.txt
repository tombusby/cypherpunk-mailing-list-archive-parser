        Which is precisely the issue. The US was and is dedicated to people
who will do what they can without restriction. 

        I'll take 38 wetback greasers who will work and escort every bum to
the Mexican border and be proud to call those beaners Americans. (Did I
overdo the namecalling?)

        Just because those folks south of the border get their jollies
producing a dozen kids does not obligate me in the least. If they produce
productive people, fine. If they once show up in the frigging welfare line,
I'll show them the way to Mexico City not San Jose. 

        ONLY if they HATE welfare and public services are they welcome. If
there were such a filter at the border that worked both ways I would have it. 

        This is not pie in the sky platitudes. We do not live in the sky.
This is reality. It is real nasty down here. Wishes are not fact. Piety
ain't jack shit. 

        I appreciate the woman's desire for the best treatment for her
child at the moment of birth. But for the long term, if they like the US
system so damned much let them institute it in Mexico. 

        If they want the benefits of the US system them duplicate it in
Mexico. Do not ever pretend to wanting the best of both worlds where you
can have two digit offspring in Mexico and the US has to pay for it. 

        We need to get the message to them, that if you can't keep your fly
shut and your legs crossed the US is not liable for your prurient
interests, period, next question, over. 

        We do not give a rat's ass how many Vatican approved babies you
produce. your recourse is not in the US. If their damned economic system
will not support them, that is not the responsibility of the US and do not
really give a rat's ass if there are automatic weapons that kill on sight
at the border. 

        The US did not create Mexico's problems, Mexico did. If they need
guns to correct it, they know where to get them. If they like the Mexican
system (and we know they do) and want to use the US, reload those border
guns.

        Fornicate Dole and the elephant he rode in on. 

        The vote needs be a quid pro quo other than birth and living.

The 2nd guarantees all the rest.
