large integer libraries?  (modexp functions?)

:     c. Specific ``software'' as follows:
:     c.1. ``Software'' having the characteristics, or performing or
: simulating the functions of the equipment controlled by 5A002 or 5B002;
:     c.2. ``Software'' to certify ``software'' controlled by 5D002.c.1;

this one (I presume) is addressed at people like microsoft with CAPI
certifications, you can't export the signing software

:     c.3. ``Software'' designed or modified to protect against malicious
: computer damage, e.g., viruses;

- Virus scanning software?  (Winn Schwartau's info warfare hype is
rubbing off on the spooks) Makes one wonder, if it's purportedly in
the national security interests to bar the export of virus scanners
(of any quality), logically it's also in the national security

- Programs which checksum themselves as a crude check against
viruses/modification?  (some _operating systems_ qualify on this
basis)

- md5file from rfc1321?  (rfc1321 is the MD5 rfc, md5file checksums
files with md5, useful for checking what's changed)?

- firewalls! (whoops there goes a few more million in US trade)

Madness,
