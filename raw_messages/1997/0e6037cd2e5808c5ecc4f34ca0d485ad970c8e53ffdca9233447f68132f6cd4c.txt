This doesn't make much sense to me. If I were to use such a UTP[*]
then I'd simply get my signature key authenticated and then use that to
sign all my encryption keys rather than getting the UTP to sign them. So 
I'd get the benefits of a recognized authentication on my keys without 
having to worry about key surrender to governments. We don't _need_ to
have anyone authenticate our encryption keys, just the signature keys.

Or am I missing something? (Other than the obvious fact that this is just
the thin end of the wedge)
