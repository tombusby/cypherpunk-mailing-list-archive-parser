      see <http://www.cfp.org/>


[4]  The Latest from Ian                                          (~30 min)
      with Ian Goldberg <iang@cs.berkeley.edu>

[5]  Trust Metrics                                                (~60 min)
      with Raph Levien <raph@acm.org>
       - Doctoral thesis update:
         - measuring & comparing trust metrics (successes and failures)
         - some limitations of the distributed certification approach
       - Two-way Web anonymizing
         Existing Web anonymizers (www.anonymizer.com and onion routers)
         provide anonymity only to the browser of information. I will
         propose a protocol analogous to the one used by e-mail nymservers
         that also allows information to be published anonymously. This
         protocol fully supports caching, and also makes it relatively
         difficult to mount spam, harassment and security flaw exploitation
         attacks.
