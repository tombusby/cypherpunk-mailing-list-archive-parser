I didn't see where Jon said that the other versions versions of PGP would
not recognize these keys. What Jon did say is that they would not generate
these keys nor force compliance with encryption to a second key. I myself
would want to know that a message encrypted with key A is also being
encrypted with key B though haveing this info in the public key itself is
not necessary.

I don't see this as a problem. My Twit/SPAM filter bounces messages
without warning. As a matter of fact most bounced messages are done so
without warning. :)

This is a stereotypical Strawman. "Even if PGP avoids GAK some other 3rd
party can modify it to be Gakware." Every version of PGP had the ability
to encrypt to multiple recipients. As I stated in my previous posts I can
get PGP 2.6.x to do everything 5.5 does with a couple of scripts. Are you
no willing to take the position that ALL versions of PGP are GAK
compliant???

No this is not mandatory GAK compliance. Mandatory GAK compliance would be
if every copy of PGP came with a government key and the program *forced*
the user to encrypt all his messages with it. This is really turning into
a shameless FUD campagne on your part Adam worthy of David "FUD"
Sternlight himself.

As far as I am concerned you have not proven your case that PGP 5.5 is GAK
compliant. Your general argument that PGP 5.5 has the potential to be GAK
can cover *ALL* version of PGP. Any system that allows encrypting to
multiple recipients can easily modified into a GAK system.

I think this is your real issue here. You don't like the ideal of a
company haveing access to their documents. If that's how you feel then
make your case so it can be judged on it's merits.
