That's the impression I got while I lived there. Many people regard 
it as rather pretentious (pace, Phil). At my school, there was 
a student who rejoiced in the moniker (I am not making this up):

"The Honorable Jamie Darymple-Hamilton, Esq."

With the old Norse system, still used in Iceland, there is a tremendous 
namespace-collision problem. There is a fairly short list of 
acceptable first names (yes, there is a list, and you have to name your 
child from it - this is fairly common outside the US), and by the second 
generation these names, and only these names, get pushed into the surname 
namespace. Immigrants change their names to Icelandic ones as a 
requirement of citizenship. The one exception is that if you are 
still living in the place you were born, you can adopt the placename
as your surname. 

Thus, Iceland, with only 265,000 people, has phonebooks which index by 
location and profession as well as by name to reach a reasonable 
level of dis-ambiguation.

[Doubtless some Magnus Magnusson (the most common male Icelandic 
name) will correct some of the details here.]
