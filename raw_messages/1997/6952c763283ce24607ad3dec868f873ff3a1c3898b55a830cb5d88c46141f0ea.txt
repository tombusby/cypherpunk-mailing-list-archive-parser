  - GO past Hwy 101...

+ From Hale-Bopp:
  - LEFT turn at Beta Pictoris.
  - LOCATE greenish-blue planet third out from star w/9-10 planets in orbit.
     (High radiation readings make it obvious.)
  - PROCEED to Northern hemisphere.
  - FIND the largest body of water.
     (Travel in the direction of the planet's rotation until you reach
      the longest coastline running between the polar ice-caps.)
  - FOLLOW the biggest N-S seismic fault.
  - RIGHT turn at the large reddish suspension bridge.

.................................. MICRO ...................................

+ Once you're on Hwy 92 (from either 280 or 101)
  - EXIT at SOUTH El Camino Real
     (From 101 it's about a mile, the 2nd of two El Camino exits)
     (From 280 it's about 7 miles, after you've come down a steep grade,
      levelled out and passed under an overpass)
  - Curve around and down under freeway: you're now travelling south on
    El Camino Real.
  - Get in the LEFT lane *immediately*.
     (Directly in front of you, you can see the Bayview highrise a couple
      of blocks away.)
  - LEFT on 20th.
     (The very first traffic light after exit ramp. Taco Bell on left).
  - RIGHT turn at next stop sign (Palm St.).
  - PROCEED 1.5 blocks.
     (Parking Garage entrance at rear of Bayview building is on your right.)

+ Once you've parked your flying saucer in the Garage:
  - STAIRS (or Elevator) to the main level, step out and...
  - WALK WEST across the courtyard to the main (tallest) building.
  - PASS through the doorway in the stand-alone exterior "glass wall"
      and approach the "information" window (also the guard station) on
      the north side of the building.
  - GET the guard's attention (preferably *not* by waving a firearm).
      Use the passwords ("PGP" or "cypherpunks") and you'll be admitted.
      If the guard's on a break, call my cellphone 415.730.3583.
  - ELEVATOR to 2nd Floor.
     (The meeting room is on left side, slightly down the hall)
      PGP's offices are on the 9th Floor (soon the 10th too).

For CalTrain-ers, get off at the San Mateo station near the Bay Meadows
horse racing track and head for the tallest building around with the huge
"Bayview" sign on top.

For the bus, take any line running on El Camino Real to the intersection of
20th in San Mateo and dismount. You're there.
