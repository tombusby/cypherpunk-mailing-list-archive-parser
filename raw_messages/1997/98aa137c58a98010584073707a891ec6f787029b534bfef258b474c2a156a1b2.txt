================================================================

What is RSAEuro?
----------------

RSAEuro is a cryptographic toolkit providing various functions
for the use of digital signatures, data encryption and supporting
areas (PEM encoding, random number generation etc).  To aid
compatibility with existing software, RSAEuro is call-compatible
with RSADSI's "RSAREF(tm)" toolkit. RSAEuro allows non-US
residents to make use of much of the cryptographic software
previously only (legally) available in the US.

RSAEuro contains support for the following:

*    RSA encryption, decryption and key generation.  Compatible
     with 'RSA Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standard
     (PKCS) #1.

*    Generation and verification of message digests using MD2,
     MD4, MD5 and SHS (SHS currently not implemented in
     higher-level functions to maintain compatibility with
     PKCS).

*    DES encryption and decryption using CBC (1, 2 or 3 keys
     using Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt) and DESX(tm), RSADSI's
     secure DES enhancement. Blowfish and RRC.2 encryption and
     decryption using CBC (available in commercial versions
     only).

*    Diffie-Hellman key agreement as defined in PKCS #3.

*    PEM support support for RFC 1421 encoded ASCII data with
     all main functions.

*    Key routines implemented in assembler for speed (80386 and
     680x0 currently supported).

*    Much improved library documentation with code samples.

International Use
-----------------

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  Please do not distribute or use this software
in the US it is 'illegal' to use this toolkit in the US, as RSADSI and
Cylink hold patents relating to public-key cryptography.  If you are a
US resident, please use the RSAREF toolkit instead.
