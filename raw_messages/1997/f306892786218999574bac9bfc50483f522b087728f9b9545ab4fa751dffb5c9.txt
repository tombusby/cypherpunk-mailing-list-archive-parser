       AMAZING DIRECT MARKETING TECHNIQUE DISCOVERED
 
     We have after spending years researching developed a way for a 
 company to sell ANY product more effectively.  It is not bulk E-mail, 
 it is much more effective.  It is ideal for anyone in MLM who needs 
 to contact only interested MLM partys or any other company for that 
 matter.  All you need to do is say how many people you want us to 
 contact and we will give you a rate and implement the system.  You 
 get qualified leads that are easy to close.
    You can sample this for as little as $20 which will put your 
 product directly in touch with 5000 people.  All you need to do is 
 E-mail us a little about your target audience and we will take care 
 of the rest.  From the information we relay to you, you should have a 
 list of very qualified cantidates for your product.
