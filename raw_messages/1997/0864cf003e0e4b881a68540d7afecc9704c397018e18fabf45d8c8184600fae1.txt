You must be joking. After all you've said about the school, you're 
recommending it? Isn't "Mr. L-18 Tag" the head of the department now?

Anyway, our correspondent is asking the wrong question. There is no 
"best" school. If you want to be a brilliant programmer, I think you 
have to be born that way. If you want theory, you need to be specific 
about your research interests. If you want mass-marketable experience in 
Windoze, avoid the big-name schools, which tend to treat Windows with 
the respect is deserves. (At Stanford, despite having a very nice Paul 
Allen Center for Integrated Systems and a posh new Bill Gates 
Information Sciences building, all instruction is done in Think C or 
UNIX.)
