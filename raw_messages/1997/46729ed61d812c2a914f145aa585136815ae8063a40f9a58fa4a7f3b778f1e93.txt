Yes, I am trying to get a number of the other cypherpunk lists together 
under one umbrella. Ambitious, but if you don't reach for the stars, 
you'll always be stuck in the lawnchair. I will add other lists that 
folks from this list mention to me, as I am looking to combine a whole 
slew of them together. This way all lists stand a better chance of 
surviving in the event of D.O.S attacks and the like.  If anyone knows a 
list that is good and should be added let me know.
