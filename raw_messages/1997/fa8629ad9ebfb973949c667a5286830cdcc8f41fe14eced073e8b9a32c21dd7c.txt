Why, exactly, is it "necessary" to "keep society moving"?   Isn't that 
somewhat of a contradiction in terms?  (particularly when you are discussing 
the subject, "anarchy."  It seems you don't really understand what the word 
"anarchy" means.   Sigh.

Are you saying that for  a world that has ALREADY achieved anarchy, and we 
presume "perfect responsibility," AP is not necessary to maintain this 
state?   Well, that's a rather limited assertion; some would argue it's 
practically meaningless.  

Isn't that somewhat like saying, "A perfectly-balanced inverted pendulum 
needs no mechanism to keep it pointing straight up."?  True, perhaps, but 
how do you get that "perfectly-balanced" part right?

Actually, it's quite the opposite:  AP is the absolute prohibition on and/or 
destruction of any "instrument of political control."

Now, to a person who thinks that the natural state of the world is a 
condition of political control (and it wouldn't be hard to understand why a 
person could come to this conclusion, given the bulk of history), the 
ABSENSE of political control "looks like" political control.

This is, obviously, akin to the optical illusion where you stare intently at 
a pattern of color on a page (the American flag is often used) for a minute 
or two, and then you suddenly glance towards a white sheet of paper on 
which, as I recall, immediately appears a complementary flag of green and 
black stripes, and black stars on a yellow field.

AP destroys the mechanisms that societies use for much political control.
