Unless someone in the U.S. is willing to go to the effort of capturing all
of the packets that comprise the crypto software package as they pass
through various MCI, Sprint, etc. networks (which is probably illegal in
itself, in most cases), on their way from the UK to your site in Australia
and then reassembling them in the U.S. into something that is in violation
of the export regulations, what difference does the path of the individual
packets make?
