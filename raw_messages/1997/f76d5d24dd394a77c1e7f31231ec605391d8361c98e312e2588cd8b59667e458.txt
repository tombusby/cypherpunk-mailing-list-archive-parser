What you're presented (included in its entirety below) is what I've come to 
call an "AP story problem."   I've worked through many of those myself; 
their main problem is that they don't carefully describe why _each_ person 
in the "play" you've described would be motivated to do what it's claim he 
does, and why he DOES NOT do other things to fix the situation he's in.  
Remember, I'm not merely talking about the main character, but also the ones 
who are (apparently?) incidental.  

For just one example, you said:    "conventional bodyguards could be 
included, ones with no real pay but with the fore knowledgethat they will be 
buried with the tyrant."

What motivates these people?  Are they hostages?  If they're hostages, then 
presumably that means they're motivated to seek the death of anyone who is 
holding them.  What about their relatives; don't they have any sympathy for 
those who are taken?  Why don't they donate to AP to see the lead guy dead?

Etc. Etc.
