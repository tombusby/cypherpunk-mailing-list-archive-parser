Mr. Avon is talking about agreements, I believe, although he is using
the private property approach to argue that there is certainly a
meeting of the minds between the two parties.

It seems reasonable that employees may agree to give up their rights,
for example their inalienable right to stay at home and watch TV, in
exchange for employment.

When the employment agreement is at will, as most are, it seems
reasonable that the company may change it whenever it pleases: "If you
wish to continue working here, you will have to let the company read
your mail."

This is complicated by the bizarre legal environment which employers
face in the United States.  In practice one would have difficulty
terminating an employee by changing the "at will" agreement.

More generally, it seems a good guess that Mr. Avon would not object
to an agreement with a company in which the company was able to
continuously monitor the employees communications or activities.
(This is why the private property approach can confuse people: this is
not the core issue.)

Guess you miss out, then.  ;-)
