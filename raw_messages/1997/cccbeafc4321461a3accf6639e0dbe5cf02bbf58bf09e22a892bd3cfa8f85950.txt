US airport security is a joke compared to other places in the world.

Contrast Lucky's account with my last trip through Germany.  Carry-ons
x-rayed.  Pat down search by white gloved personnel.  Asked to take photo
with my camera (to demonstrate it was real).  Full power-on of laptop.
Laptop weighed and checked against book containing manufacturer's specs.
And this is standard, not because I was flagged as an evil Cypherpunk or
fit some profile.  Everything done very efficiently, with few delays.

Your mileage may vary.  I've been in other places, where US airport
security looks like Fort Knox.  The main reason (no matter where you go) is
unmotivated, minimum-wage, rent-a-cops placed in a tedious work environment.

Ob-Crypto: During some real serious globe-trotting over the past couple of
years, no one has ever looked at the contents of my hard drive.  Even when
I've been detained by customs (non-US), doing a pretty detailed search of
my luggage.
