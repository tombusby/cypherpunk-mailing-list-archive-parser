  The P1363 IEEE Public-Key Standard.

- David Jablon:
  A new network identification system.

- Jens-Peter Kaps, WPI:
  High-speed implementation of DES on FPGAs.

- Christian Cachin, MIT:
  Unconditionally secure key agreement.

- Tobias Lohrenz and Kai Wollenweber, U. Siegen, Germany:
  Implementation of a key-agile ATM security module.
