To some (perhaps many, certainly not all) distant servers, provided all
the news servers in the path run appropriate software (designed for low
latency propagation) and have reasonably high bandwidth Internet links. 
Disk to disk delays smaller than 1 second have been measured between news
servers that use software such as nntplink or innfeed to send outgoing
articles immediately.

Right.  And some of those news links are fast, while others are slow.  If
two sites happen to be connected by fast news links, it's quite possible
for news between those sites to be faster than mail.
