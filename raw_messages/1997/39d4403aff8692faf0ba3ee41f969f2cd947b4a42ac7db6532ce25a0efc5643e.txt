What you are suggesting is reminiscent of IRC.  Except, I think that each
IRC network has a central computer which could be controlled.

On your idea for fast implementation,  this could be hacked by would-be
censors.  A message comes into the list, the censor sees that the post is
from a regular enemy.  The censor then copies the header information onto a
new message, one containing garbage, or snippets from old posts, reads the
new post to see if it is acceptable, and if it is, adds a new header,
probably only the time would be changed, and transmits it out.  If the would
be censor was the sysop of a machine near the origin of the message, and if
the censor operated the censorship either by bots, or monitored the feed 24
hours a day, (not likely), then the actual message would get to few.
