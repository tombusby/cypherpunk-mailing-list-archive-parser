Abstinance is murder.

Letting just _one_ egg miss fertilization denies that egg the chance to become
a human being.  I think that the felony charge should be manslaughter for this
crime as it's not quite as bad as:

Birth control

Birth control is nothing more than premeditated murder, though
I think that a plea-bargain in most cases should be offered: Drop the charge
to manslaughter if the perp agrees to artificial insemination with the eggs of
some woman who is unable to get pregnant due to some medical condition.

However, I hope that medical research is improved to the point where the male
can carry the child in such cases.

Just think of all of the wonderful people who won't ever be born because some
geek is wanking into a tissue, or some thirteen year old is kept from fucking
by their prudish parents.  Now _these_ people should be brought up on
accessory charges...

As for Gays and Lezbians, well, sorry but that's right out.  Such unproductive
behaviour cannot be tolerated.
