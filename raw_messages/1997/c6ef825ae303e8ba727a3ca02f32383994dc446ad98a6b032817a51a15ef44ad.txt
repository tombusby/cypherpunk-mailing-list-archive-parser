	With phone calls, yes. With unwanted faxes no. With Phone Calls, 
and knocks on the door I have the option of simply not answering. Faxes
(in certain enviroments) you can't do that with.

	Or simply a societal acceptance of retaliation(sp?) Someone who
constantly wakes you up in the middle of the night, well you just arrange
it so they get no sleep.

	I (I think like you) feel that almost no one will get convicted
of these "crimes" unless the attacker simply goes too far.

	Not really. The US Postal service is a regulated monopoly, and 
is the only game in town. If they weren't a regulated monopoly, I wouldn't
care if they refused to carry certain peices of mail, the mailer would have 
the option of simply using a different service.

	Thus with compuserve, they have the right (as a private company)
to refuse to deliver what ever they wish. And their users have the right 
to go elsewhere.

	Which I argee with.
