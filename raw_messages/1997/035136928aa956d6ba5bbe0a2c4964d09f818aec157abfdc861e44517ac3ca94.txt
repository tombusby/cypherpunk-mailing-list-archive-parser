Although my statement was deliberately somewhat exaggerated, it is
not that far from reality for quite a few people I know.

A real-life example:

A single (divorced) mother, 4 kids (3-12 years), working full-time
and making in theory $42 000/year. After taxes that comes down to
$2000 cash per month.

In order for her to be able to work her two youngest kids go to a
day-care-center. Wham! $1000 per month (hiring a baby-sitter would
amount to even more).
Her apartment costs $800/month excluding utilities. That leaves
$200 (+ $800 she gets in child-support) per month for _five_ people
to live on (clothes, food, utilities, school-books, gas for the
car, etc.etc.)

One thousand dollars per month for five people!! And that in New
York City!
She is not entitled to any support such as free school-meals for
the kids etc., because she "makes too much money" (_before_ taxes,
of course!)

What efforts has she made to make "herself more marketable"? She has
been working ever since the age of 16, went 8 years to College (paid
by herself and paying rent at the same time) and now has a Masters
Degree in teaching.

What has it brought her? Bill-collectors calling every day!

She made a calculation and (confirming your statement) came to the
conclusion, that she indeed would have _more_ money by not working
at all and simply going on welfare.

However, that is not a choice she wants to make.

Is she to be called "stupid" and "selfish" because she's poor
despite her efforts???

I don't think so. She, btw., is not the only person I know
struggeling in this manner from one month into the next, barely
being able to even catch up on bills.

Neither does she have a free choice of employers. There is only one
board of education in the City. Changing for a private school would
come with (at least a temporary) pay-cut, that she obviously can't
afford.

Therefore:

Since she isn't the only person I can think of, who is in such a
position, the argument formerly known as "If 'ya don't like the
company-policy [employing GAK/CAK] just leave and work for
somebody else" may now be called: "Ad Acta".
