Ah, but the difference is that we haven't yet seen Louis Freeh being led
into the same gas chamber that the Israelis used to send Eichmann to
justice.

History is written by the winners. Had the Nazis won the Second World War,
it would have been U.S. generals and leaders of the World Zionist Congress
who would have have been tried and executed.

Too soon to tell whether it'll be Freeh and Reno swinging from the end of a
rope, or folks like us.

I wonder how the SS at Stanford will react to my "Death Penalty for Waco
Commander in Chief!" placard?

(Such a placard being a free speech statement of what justice I expect for
the Ruby Ridge and Waco Commander in Chief, not a personal threat.)

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
