Some of the guys in the HP user group have UNIX running on Vectras,
but they also use a full raft of hardware tools, which I don't have
access to.  There's an actual HP-48 calculator, complete in every way
including appearance, running on that version of UNIX.  Don't remember
the name, but it comes on a few CD's, and costs around $50.

To me, 486 and 50 mhz suggest something HP is getting far removed from,
so don't expect much help there.  Few if any computer outlets will be
able to handle the HP peculiarities.  You shouldn't have any trouble
getting the general parts list off the internet here and there, and
there used to be HP forums to provide off-line support on Vectra
hardware, but it might be harder with older equipment.

Suggestion: Call HP Palo Alto at 415-857-1501, and tell them you need
to talk to someone who knows internet domain names for info on Vectras
and the like.  Don't let them slough you off - if they don't have the
info, make them give you another name and number.  If you get a
runaround after several calls, let me know who you talked to, on
what phone #'s, at what time, and I'll give it a shot myself.
