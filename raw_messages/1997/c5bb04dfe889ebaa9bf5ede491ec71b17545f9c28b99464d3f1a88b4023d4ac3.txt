> THE PHYSICS OF TRAFFIC JAMS.  German scientists have
> shown that the changeover from free-flowing traffic to a traffic jam
> (in which cars on a highway are greatly slowed or halted, at least
> temporarily) conforms to the well-known physics of phase
> transitions, an example of which is the transition from water to ice. 
> In other words, traffic jams are not random patterns, but are
> deterministic in nature; that is, when a parameter exceeds a
> threshold value---such as the flux of cars---then local perturbations
> can grow, possibly leading to jams, analogous to the nucleating
> effect of tiny ice grains in a body of water being frozen.  Once
> formed the jam moves along the highway as if it were a kind of
> "solid," with identifiable edges and with a "vapor" of comparatively
> free cars in front of and behind it.  The information gained in this
> sort of research, the researchers believe, might lead to more
> accurate traffic forecasts and could be used in future "intelligent"
> transport systems.  (B.S. Kerner and H. Rehborn, Physical Review
