 BLACK LIBERATION RADIO BUSTED!


   This morning, the FCC raided Black Liberation Radio in Decatur,
Illinois and seized all the equipment. BLR, an unlicensed radio
station operated by Napolean and Mildred Williams, has been a growing
thorn in the side of the local power structure. BLR has brought
together the predominantly white workers who have undergone bitter
strikes in the 90s (Caterpillar, etc.) with unemployed blacks and
whites. It has given them all a voice, not just locally but to a
degree nationally (Napolean was the keynote speaker at the recent
Micro Broadcasters Convention in Oakland).
   This pioneering station must go back on the air. Napoleon requests
donations to help them fight this. Please send what you can to:
Napoleon Williams, 637 E Center St., Decatur IL 63526. In the face of
a growing police state, Napoleon and Mildred are fighting back. They
need your help.
