I can see practical problems with this (like finding out
that the fine print on page 248 of my insurance contract
turns out not to cover dog bites that occur on Thursdays),
but it's really just letting customers buy only what they
want.

One problem with this is that, if it becomes widespread,
nobody will ever buy insurance for these diseases unless
they have it or probably will get it.  This kind-of defeats
the point of having insurance, which is to protect yourself
from low probability high cost things happening.  That is,
before I've taken the test for genetic disease X, my best
estimate of the probability that I will test positive is
very low.  Once I have taken it, I know the result.  If I
sign up for a-la-carte insurance for this disease, the
insurance company effectively knows I must have tested
positive for a predisposition to it, and so either won't
give me insurance, or will give me insurance only at an
extremely high rate (corresponding to a 1/10 chance of
getting the disease, rather than a 1/1,000,000 chance).

On the other hand, information isn't free--I have to spend
some money for each of the hundreds of genetic tests
available.  There may be a profitable business in providing
a battery of genetic tests for a large up-front fee, in a
sort-of inverse-lottery scheme--if you get unlucky enough to
have one or more of these disease precursors, we pay your
insurance costs, or at least give you a big bundle of money
to spend as you will.  This is subject to various kinds of
abuse (if you know you're predisposed to get some disease,
you have a strong incentive to enter the ``lottery''), but
it still might work.
