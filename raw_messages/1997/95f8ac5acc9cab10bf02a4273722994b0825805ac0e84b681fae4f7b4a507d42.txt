Of course they will.  If the unsearched portions of the keyspace
are published, you can just sit back until the odds go up and
then throw some CPU power at it.  There is no obligation on the
part of the individual who finds the key to not claim the prize
personally.

The issues of random keyspace assignment to protect against
sabotage and centralized monolithic server vs autonomous client
have been debated on the "muffin" list, where I have been
lurking, but the people in charge seem to like explicit keyspace
partitioning and servers a lot.

Should be an interesting effort.

By the way, does anyone know if des-challenge@muffin.org is
alive?  I haven't seen any messages from it in over a day and
majordomo is not responding to inquiries.
