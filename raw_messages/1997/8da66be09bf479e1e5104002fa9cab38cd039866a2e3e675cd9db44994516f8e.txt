	<sigh> My apologies to Jonathan, the boyos in the Hills, and those
watching for the Choppers.  I wrote:

	The vendor, Sensar, Inc. <http://www.sensar.com> is planning to
unveil the system at the Banking Administration Institute's conference in
New Orleans the day after tomorrow.   The company's version of the product
and its expected use is a little less conspiratorial than Jonathan's post
to C'punks -- but it more than suffices to force me to eat crow for my
scepticism and unwarranted sarcasm.

>I just heard that a bank card company has just released a program for using

>(Every ATM has a security camera.)  Over time, as people use the ATM, the
