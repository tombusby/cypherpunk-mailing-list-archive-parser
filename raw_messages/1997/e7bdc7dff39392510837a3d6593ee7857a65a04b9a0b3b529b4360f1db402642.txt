I suggest that nobody do this, as this will filter out anonymous mail
from these remailers.  You do, of course, have the right to filter out
whomever you want, but there are worthwhile anonymous contributions
from these remailers.  I personally don't see what the big deal is
with these ascii-art messages.  95% of the time, these messages are
very easy to spot, and the remaining 5%, it takes two seconds to hit
the "delete" key.
