I would like to warn and ask subscribers of cypherpunks@algebra.com.

We are going ot get full feel from Lance Cottrell and
cypherpunks-unedited@toad.com.

We will filter messages by Message-ID to get rid of duplicates.

It means that there is no sense (unless you want to confirm my integrity
as the list host) to be subscribed to any of the other lists, as you 
will be getting multiple copies of messages.

If you are afraid of that and use Unix, the following procmail recipe 
gets rid of duplicates:

#
# This recipe removes duplicates!
#
:0 Wh: msgid.lock
| formail -D 32768 msgid.cache

I am somwehat concerned by the behavior of my majordomo which is
very paranoid about incoming messages: it rejects all messages that
it THINKS are attempts to suscribe and unsuscribe. In this rejection, 
it is sometimes too broad. I do not know how to solve this problem.

ATTENTION: if you want to get a feed from me, PLEASE send me a note and
do not simply subscribe your mailing list to cypherpunks@algebra.com. It
is because I want to send you the messages before my majordomo rewrites
headers.

	- Igor.
