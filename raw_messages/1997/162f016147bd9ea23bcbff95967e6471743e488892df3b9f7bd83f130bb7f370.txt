What charge was he arrested on? Was it his property? Did he have the land
owners permission? He should have put it on a pole on the right of way.

I own some land, you go putting a sign on my fence without my permission and
I promise you I will press tresspasing charges in an instant, even if I
agree with the sentiment. I've had to threaten several DPS officers (Texas
state troopers) with this because they like to park their cruiser in the drive
outside my fence but still within the property line without asking my
permission to do paperwork and eat.

They don't do it anymore.
