This has  nothing to do  with cypherpunks, but  I just could  not resist
seeing a reference to  a martial art that I still  love to practice. Dan
most likely  refers to Aikido  (and not Judo)  here. A martial  art that
uses the momentum/force  of the "partner" to disarm  h{im,er} and change
the "attack" to a victory in your advantage...
