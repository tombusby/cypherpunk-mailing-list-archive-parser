If you are going to run a remailer, you had better expect that some of
the people who use it aren't going to be your friends.

And this has to be the lowest pressure attack on remailers that there
can be.  God forbid anybody should try for real to shut down the
remailer network.

This is understandable - running a remailer offers little tangible
reward.

On the other hand, if somebody were making $500,000 a year running a
remailer, they might defend it a little more vigorously.  And, if they
didn't, somebody in the Carribbean might be happy to snap up the
business.

Here are two simple solutions: 1. charge hashcash 2. charge ecash.

This eliminates the spam problem.  It would probably reduce the
harrassment problem as well.

This is not a good idea.  I like being able to pump a few megabytes a
day through the remailer network to create cover traffic.  Right now
this would be an act of bad citizenship.

But, if we were paying for remailer usage it would be a good thing.
Good for me, good for the businesses I patronize.
