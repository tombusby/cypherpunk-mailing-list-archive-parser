I'm working on a paper, it's one of the technical hurdles on the way
to my Eternity DDS eternity service implementation.

Anyone know anything very relevant to this?  I've mostly just started on
the research (my current exciting project has been Linux Fibre Channel and
making a bloody fast, yet maybe secure, yet small cipher for an on board
processor), and pointers would be useful.  It isn't as hard a problem as
I first thought, though.  This seems like the kind of thing everyone's favorite
judge-threatening tree-hugger-nose-mac-10-inserting gun-hoarding
old-man-on-the-mountain would have done N years ago :) [flames, fan.  
gasoline. rdx...] so I'd rather not reinvent the wheel more than once or twice.

Ryan (getting dangerously close to having a working Eternity DDS demo,
and wondering if FC98 will be on mbone, particularly the solar eclipse, since
even if he had the money to go, it's in the middle of next semester, and 
disappearing for a week would kind of be difficult, although not at all
impossible of someone wants to pay for me to go...ahh, but there's always
next year)
