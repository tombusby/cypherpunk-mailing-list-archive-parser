Also, how did Gates and his sons know the car was in fact the suspect's car?

I doubt they could read a license plate of an approaching car, if in fact
the cops even knew the license plate number and had broadcast it.

If it turns out that  the Gates family merely set up their own roadblock
and tried to stop a car matching the general description (e.g., "a late
model white Ford sedan," which might well be the case for a police chase),
then they were truly reckless.

If I were driving my late model white Ford sedan through the backroads of
rural Missouri and some potential rednecks up ahead had their vehicles
blocking the road, I'd for damn sure not stop so they could rob and maybe
kill me. I'd gun the accelerator and try to get around this roadblock.


As they weren't cops and the vehicles weren't police cars, why should a
driver be fool enough to stop for some rednecks blocking the road?

(If this example is not clear, ask yourself if you would stop your car for
some blacks in Miami who blocked the road with their vehicles....)


This is precisely why we don't want helpful do-gooders setting up their own
road blocks and firing shots at cars that don't stop.

(P.S. If it turns out the Gates family knew _with certainty_ that the
approaching car was in fact exactly the one being chased, and if their
vehicles were painted fire engine red (not typical for volunteer fire
deparment folks and their private vehicles), then this slightly ameliorates
the recklessness of their actions. But I'd be surprised if this is the
case. And I know that if some rural yahoos tried to stop me by blocking the
road, I'd shoot first and ask questions later, as *I* would be the party
actually defending myself against a threat.)
