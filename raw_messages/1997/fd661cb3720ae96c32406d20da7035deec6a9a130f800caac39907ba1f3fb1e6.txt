With chained, multiply-encrypted messages, logs are ineffective unless all
of the links in the chain collude to trace messages. While this is
certainly possible, it seems unlikely.

This allegation was made by some clueless Washington think tank authors.
They provided no evidence, only innuendo, and they were unwilling or unable
to provide any further comments when queried by several Cypherpunks.

And given that many or even most of the remailer operators are members of
the various related Cypherpunks or Remailers Operators lists, and are known
to various of us, the notion that most (or even many) remailers are run by
intelligence agencies is absurd.

I don't recognize your name on this list. Fine, as we always like to see
new subscribers. But I surmise you just haven't spent enough time yet
reading and thinking about these issues.

Welcome to the Cypherpunks list.
