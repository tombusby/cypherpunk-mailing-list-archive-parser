I'm not sure I see why you draw this distinction.

Is it because the person sending may intend the message for Alice
only?  If so I think Jon said that all current versions of PGP warn
the user that their is a company escrow situation when you send to the
key (this information being in attributes of the key).

Snooping Alice's outgoing traffic, and snooping Alice's incoming
traffic are similarly little brotherish in my view.

If the company has an approval system for official statements (seems
reasonable, if it's a press release, important contractual decision,
etc), then Alice can send a copy to the legal beagles for the ok, and
they can send it on.

I figure this is fair game also... clearly they can see the traffic
coming into LAN and being delivered to Alice's mailbox.

I don't like it either.  But how is this so different from snooping on
what Alice sends.

Agree.

I was arguing earlier that the way for the company to do archiving of
received encrypted email was for archive copy to be taken after the
employee has decrypted it.  The employee should be made aware that the
received email is being archived.
