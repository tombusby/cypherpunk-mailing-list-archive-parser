This is precisely the category into which I fall.  It is a pain to
unsubscribe from a list, since my "From_" header doesn't agree with my
"From:" header (the former has a specific host included, the latter
only a zone), and this often triggers a message to the list owner for
processing.

In any case, I am willing to go along with the experiment.  But a
NoCeM-style approach to killing the noise is much more preferable.
Failing that, an individual filter (such as procmail) is good.  In any
event, the responsibility of what to post and what to read should be
in the hands of each reder individually.
