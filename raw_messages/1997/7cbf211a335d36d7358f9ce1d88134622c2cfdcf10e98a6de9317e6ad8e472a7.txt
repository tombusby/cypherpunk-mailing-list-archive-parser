All true.  But, in the case of the anonymous post there has usually
been no indication other than writing style and topic that suggests
the poster is using the context of previous anonymous posts.  There's
no particular reason to think the second post has anything to do with
the first.

This means that the ideas cannot be developed to any great depth or
detail.  I would prefer to see anonymous posters include the messages
which supply context or just give the message IDs.

Actually, it's the context and the complexity of the text that
interests me.  If ten different people play the role of anonymous in
one thread, each accepting the context of the previous posters, there
is no reason why that isn't just as interesting as if it were one
poster.

And even then it never hurts to think carefully about why they should
be trusted, how it is that they know what they claim to know, and if
there are any ways to verify their claims.

That's okay, though, because you deal with each post on its own merits
one at a time.  If person "C" says "This posts uses the remarks by the
anonymous poster in posts 1, 2, 3,.. as context" then you can say,
"You now say X, but before you said Y, and that's a contradiction."

That person (or even another person) can come back and say something
genuinely interesting like "It seems like a contradiction, but in fact
it isn't for such-and-such a reason."

In practice the way people have been doing this is just by signing
their posts "TruthMonger" or something.  But, message IDs give you
more control over the accepted context.

Sabotaging a non-persistent identity through a remailer is effortless.
Forging takes a little more effort.

But, yes, I would like to see more people signing their messages.  It
would reduce some problems.
