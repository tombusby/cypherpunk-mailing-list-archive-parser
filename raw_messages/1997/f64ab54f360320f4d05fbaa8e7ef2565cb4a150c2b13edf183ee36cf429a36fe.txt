|PGP will encrypt any file.  The win95 version allows you to do it with one 
|click of a mouse button from explorer, as PGP becomes fully integrated into 
|Win95.

Allow me to add that it is also quite easy to (1) hide a short PGP encrypted 
message within the jpeg or gif thereby hiding the fact one is using PGP at 
all or (2) hide an unencrypted message within a jpeg or gif file and encrypt 
the combination. And don't forget wav files also as envelopes.

Choose the medium for maximum message size (and pleasure).
