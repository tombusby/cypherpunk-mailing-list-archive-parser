Fine, but what I quoted to you was the definition of generally
available, FROM THE TEXT OF THE BILL ITSELF.  It is in paragraph
5B of that part of the bill.  Look yourself, or read it below,
and you will see that it doesn't say anything about the software
having to be available overseas.  That part of your article was
mistaken.  I like your reporting so I don't want to over do this,
but you should know that the bill does not require what you
said:

            Sure,
            removing export controls completely would benefit
            everyone, but SAFE doesn't go that far: Only software
            "that is generally available" overseas may be exported.
            Which means if I invent a new data-scrambling method
            that nobody overseas has developed, I'm screwed.

Section 5B from the text of the bill, again (formatted better):

  (B) the term `generally available' means, in the case of software
  (including software with encryption capabilities), software that is
  offered for sale, license, or transfer to any person without
  restriction, whether or not for consideration, including, but not
  limited to, over-the-counter retail sales, mail order transactions,
  phone order transactions, electronic distribution, or sale on
  approval;

Nothing about foreign software.

So you agree with his interpretation that software must pass the tests
in both paragraph 2 and paragraph 3?  That doesn't seem right.  Para
2 says that no license is required for the kind of software
it describes.  Para 3 then provides a procedure for authorizing
the export of software which meets a different test (similar to
what is allowed for export to non-US financial institutions).  But
these are different tests and different software.

I say that paragraph 2 applies basically to "off the shelf" software,
commercial or public domain.  No license is required to export that.
That's why there are those definitions of generally available and
as-is.  Software which does not fall into these categories can then
be authorized for export under paragraph 3, except that the
authorization can be cancelled if it is diverted to terrorists.

If they wanted to diversion rules to apply to paragraph 2, they
would have written it that way.  But the way it is written it is
only the paragraph 3 software which can lose its authorization.

This is a very logical interpretation.  There is no point in
restricting the export of paragraph 2 software since it is available
to anyone in the US.  Any terrorist can walk into Egghead and buy
Netscape with strong crypto, or any disk encryption package.
This is an argument which cypherpunks have made for years, and they
are 100% right.  Why is it so hard to believe that the congressman
followed the same logic.
