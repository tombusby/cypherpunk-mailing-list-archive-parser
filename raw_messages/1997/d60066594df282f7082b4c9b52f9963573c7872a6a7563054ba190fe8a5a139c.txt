Okay, Java sounds pretty good.  The native bigint library clinches it!

Aside from political correctness issues, why not?  It would also be
nice to have an encrypted SMTP channel which happens to be riding on
IPSEC.

The more I think about the more the separation of authentication keys
from communication keys seems like the way to go.  If both parties can
connect to each other's machines in real time, then a negotiated key
which is discarded is great.  More often everybody's offline, but that
just means you have to publish many different communications keys,
perhaps sorted by hours.  (Given remailer lag you might have to keep
communications keys around for a day or two after expiration, but
that's not too bad.)

It's also complicated and hard to understand.  The Right Thing (TM) is
to simply solve the entropy problem correctly.

The problem with computers generating entropy is that they are
complicated machines which are designed to be deterministic.  While it
seems reasonable that keystrokes and mouse movements have some
entropy, its hard to really convince yourself that there couldn't be
patterns arising from the OS somehow.  For example, maybe the sample
times form weird patterns which are related to the scheduler.

By all means this can be XORed in, but it seems dangerous to rely upon
it if you are trying to be hardcore and use one time pads.

Most plausible failure modes in hardware should be detectable with the
usual tests for "randomness".

Software and computers are highly complex devices and we don't truly
understand every aspect of their operation.  We can say it's unlikely
that there are patterns in the bits they generate, but if we resorting
to one time pads, it seems to me that the entropy question has to be
nailed down completely.  (Not that I have a good solution, yet.  As
you pointed out, one time pads consume a lot of entropy.  It takes a
long time to flip a coin 1.5 MB * 1024 bytes/MB * 8 bits/byte times!)
