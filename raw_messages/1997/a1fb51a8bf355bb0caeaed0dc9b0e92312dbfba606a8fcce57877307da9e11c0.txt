Sexswap is an effective hit generator that concentrates
all banner exchanges in the strongest segment of the internet...
the Adult Industry.

Any webmaster with an adult site can join. Fill out a short form, paste 
in some code, and upload your banner. Within minutes, you will be 
accumulating FREE banner advertising on hundreds of similar sex sites.

1 Fast and easy free hits
/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/
Perhaps the most popular way to increase traffic is through banner-trades 
or link-swaps. These methods are effective, but also time consuming. A 
person can join Sexswap instantly and begin having his/her banner shown 
on hundreds of sites around the world.

2 Automated to save time and energy
/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/
In the old days, we'd surf over to an adult site, try to locate the 
webmaster's email, and then send a letter begging and pleading with the 
owner to trade 1 link. This is time intensive, and downright 
embarrassing. A person can join Sexswap in 3 minutes and begin 
accumulating FREE banner advertising for his/her site. No more searching, 
begging, or link verifying.

3 Banners! Not text-links
/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/
Link-trades do get clicks, but banner-trades get more clicks and produce 
clicks of a more potent nature. The problem with trading banners is, your 
page eventually looks like freakin' circus after 4 or 5 trades. You can't 
trade banners endlessly since page real estate is at a premium, bandwidth 
is expensive, and surfers don't want to wait 17 minutes for your page to 
load. With the Sexswap code, your page gets one banner that changes with 
each load. You will be trading banner spots with hundreds of sites, yet 
only using one simple banner spot.

4 No java to bomb browsers
/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/
Pyramids, consoles, and circle-loops...they are all brilliant creations, 
but many of them are written in Java, and many of them bomb your 
customer's browsers. 70-90% of the market uses Netscape and Internet 
Explorer, but there is still a segment of the population using rarer, or 
older browsers. 10%-20% isn't huge, but it is enough to make a dent in 
your pocket book. A bombed customer does not click on a link and does not 
make you cash. Sexswap is written in good old C++, a man's programming 
language,) fast and stable.

5 No side effects
/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/
Pyramids, Consoles, and circle-loops all tend to advertise themselves, 
rather than your site. A fresh sew surfer can easily be lured away from 
your site when encountered by these new fangled advertising devises. 
Aesthetics...have you ever seen a console that made your page look 
better? Page-load times...these tricky java programs can slow down your 
page, and slowness can mean less surfers and less clicks. Sexswap 
requires only one simple banner be placed on your page. We even use our 
bandwidth to load the banners 

6 Real-time statistics
/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/
Sexswap offers the following stats in real-time formats
Number of ads your site has shown: 
Number of times your ad was shown:

7 GIF - JPG - Animated GIF all supported
/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/
Sexswap can use any of the big three banner formats. Many of our 
competitors do not allow animation...we love animated gifs. The banner 
requirements for Sexswap are 468x60, less than 15k in size. The banners 
on excite and infoseek also follow this standard format.
