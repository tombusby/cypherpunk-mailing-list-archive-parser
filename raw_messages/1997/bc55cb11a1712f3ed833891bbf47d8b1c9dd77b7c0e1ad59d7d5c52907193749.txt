*** Study sees privacy lacking on government Web sites

While the Clinton administration is pressuring companies with Internet
sites to respect the privacy of Web surfers, a new survey finds the
government itself is far from perfect regarding this issue. Almost
half the 70 Internet sites run by federal agencies collect data about
visitors, but most disclose nothing about how the information will be
used, according to OMB Watch. Privacy concerns arise on the Internet
because whenever a person using Web browsing software visits a site,
the site can collect information about the person, sometimes without
their knowledge. For the full text story, see
