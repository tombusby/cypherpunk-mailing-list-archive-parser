So a remailer, such as Cracker, that might send out an average of 3,000
emails per day would be required to use up 3,000 * 20 secs = 17 hours of
cpu time per day.  Since a portion of these emails are to multiple
recipients, then let's add 1/3 extra hashcash CPU time, or a total of about
22 hours of CPU time per day.

Now since Cracker runs on old, antiquated equipment, easily two or more
years out of date, I think we need to double this figure.  (The Cracker CPU
is actually less than 1/4 of the speed of many up to date desktop
machines.)  So, we would need about 44 hours of CPU time each day.

Of course the Cracker mail system also runs various mail lists for EFGA.
So we will need hashcash for these messages as well.  If I wish to send out
a personal email to each of say 900 nyms, then I will have to generate 900
* 20 seconds, or 5 hours of hashcash time in order to send an individual
message to each nym.  I certainly can setup myself as a privileged user on
the Cracker SMTP port and bypass this requirement, but I'll need the
hashcash for the unknown destination address of final delivery.

Of course, since we might be able to delete the need for hashcash among
people who know each other, we could have Cracker build a database of
people who like to have privacy, and not have to generate the hashcash if
we find you in our files.  ISP's in general could handle the hashcash
generation at the SMTP level by keeping databases of who sends email to
whom.  It is of course far easier to do a single database lookup than to
generate the 20 seconds of hashcash.

I don't know.  I just don't understand the plan fully.  I'll have to think
about it some more.
