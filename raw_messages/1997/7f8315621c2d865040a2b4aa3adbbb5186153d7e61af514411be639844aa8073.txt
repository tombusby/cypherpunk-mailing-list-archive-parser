> OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - A gun-control measure on the Washington ballot has

> In this gun battle, the two sides are armed with cash and

> On one side is the state medical association, law enforcement
> leaders, religious groups, the state's largest teachers union and
> Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, among other Seattle-area business

> They back the measure, which would require handgun owners to
> pass an exam or take an eight-hour safety course to get a license.
> It would also require trigger locks on all handguns sold or
> transferred in the state.
> On the other side are gun rights organizations, like the
> National Rifle Association, and police groups, which say the
> measure is an invasion of privacy, an infringement of the right to
> bear arms and a smokescreen for a hidden agenda: registration and
> eventual confiscation of handguns.
> ``What they're doing is basically using children and hiding
> behind a phony handgun safety ballot title,'' said Alan Gottlieb,
> chairman of the Bellevue-based Citizens Committee for the Right to
> Keep and Bear Arms. ``These people don't want education. They want
> to make it very hard for people to buy a handgun or use one, and
> that's exactly what this initiative does.''
> If voters OK the measure on the Nov. 4 ballot, Washington will pass some
> of the strictest gun laws in the nation.
> Only a dozen states require some sort of handgun permit or
> license, and just two - Massachusetts and Connecticut - have passed

> would require them on all guns sold, even person to person.
> Nine of the nation's largest gun makers announced Thursday that
> they would provide childproof locks with all of their new handguns
> - - about 80 percent of those sold in the United States. President
> Clinton has pushed for legislation requiring the locks, but House
> and Senate committees rejected the provision earlier this year.
> No public polls on the measure have been released so far, but
> some of the richest people in the state back it: Gates gave
> $35,000; his father, lawyer William H. Gates, donated $150,000, and
> philanthropist Harriet Stimson Bullitt contributed $50,000.
> The safety requirements, they say, would be like taking a
> driver's test before getting a license. The goal is to reduce
> accidental shootings, particularly those involving children who find
> loaded guns in the home.
> A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found
> that 30 people 19 or younger died in unintentional shootings in
> Washington state between 1991 and 1995. And 211 others were
> hospitalized for gunshot wounds.
> `I'm personally unwilling to tolerate that kind of carnage in
