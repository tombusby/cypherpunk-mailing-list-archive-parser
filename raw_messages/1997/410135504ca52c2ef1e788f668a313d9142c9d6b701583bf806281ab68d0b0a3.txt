I don't understand TCM's recent comments about Kallstrom
doing a "good job" on proving or concluding that the airliner TWA800
was not shot down or bombed.

anyone who has followed anything written by Ian Goddard
on the internet can only drop their mouth in disbelief.

I urge anyone who wants more facts on the matter to look
up Ian Goddard's web site on a search engine. there is
a lot of really solid evidence, including extremely credible
eyewitness accounts, that it was a MISSILE. whether it was
from our own government or not is a question -- but I 
fail to see how any well-informed people cannot be aware
of the foul, odiferous coverup by the FBI (which to me 
suggests it was a US military exercise)

also see the book by James Sanders, "the downing of flight TWA800"--
he had a confidential informant involved in the NTSB 
investigation.

Today the FBI ended the TWA Flight 800 criminal probe. The FBI's
lead investigator James Kallstrom said that the FBI found
"absolutely no evidence" that the tragedy was the result of
a criminal act.

But what was the FBI telling Congress after the incident
occurred? The following expert from CNN is worth saving.
Keep in mind that the FBI Director was simultaneously
lobbying the Judiciary Committee for expanded wiretap
authority.

U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who was among members of Congress briefed
Friday by FBI Director Louis Freeh, said it looked "pretty darn conclusive"
that
either a bomb or a missile caused the explosion.

"We're looking at a criminal act," Hatch said. "We're looking at somebody who
either put a bomb on it or shot a missile, a surface-to-air missile."

Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told CNN he came to his conclusions
after "various conversations" with government officials.

"I won't go so far as to say it was terrorism, but there was sabotage
here," Hatch
said. "It looks like that."

"It's very -- almost 100 percent unlikely -- that this was a mechanical
failure," he
said. "It looks pretty darn conclusive that it was an explosion caused either
internally or externally that was caused by a criminal act."
