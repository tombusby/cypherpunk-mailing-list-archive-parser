This also assumes that the supremes, knowing the president may be 
impeached on the 3rd overturned bill, would not be less likely to 
overturn it because of the political turmoil created. Also it assumes the 
supremes cannot be brought, by and large a president doesn`t care about 
individual bills, if his ass was on the line it would be a case for more 
desperate action on his part.
