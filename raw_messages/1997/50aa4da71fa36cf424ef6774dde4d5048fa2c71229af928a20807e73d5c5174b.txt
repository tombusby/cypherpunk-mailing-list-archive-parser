Here's my understanding of the situation:

 - Newsgroups alt.cypherpunks, alt.cypherpunks.announce,
	alt.cypherpunks.social, alt.cypherpunks.technical have been created.

 - The distributed list is still forming and so far consists of
	cypherpunks@algebra.com, cypherpunks@ssz.com, and others of which I
	do not know the location.  A mail<->news gateway is planned, but not
	yet in place, between the distributed list and the newsgroup(s).
	cypherpunks@algebra.com is receiving messages from
	cypherpunks-unedited.  I assume this means that the other hosts part
	of the distributed list are also receiving cypherpunks-unedited
	messages.

 - Lance Cottrell is running another list (cypherpunks@cyberpass.net) that is
	not yet part of the distributed list.  It is also receiving feed from
	toad.com.

If you don't want to miss any messages, then you should subscribe to both
cypherpunks@cyberpass.net and one of the distributed list nodes.  Since both
are receiving cypherpunks-unedited, you can safely unsubscribe from
cypherpunks-unedited, -flames, or the "main" list.  Since these lists have
overlapping content, you should delete duplicates.
