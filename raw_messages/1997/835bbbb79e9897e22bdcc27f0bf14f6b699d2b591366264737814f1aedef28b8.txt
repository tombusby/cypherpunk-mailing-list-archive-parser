Remember when the phone company used to lease you your phone?  Surely that
doesn't make the data that goes over the phone their property?  If my
doctor calls me at work with the results of a critical test, you believe
that data is no longer private?  I hope not.  You think whatever goes on in
a rental car I drive is the property of the rental company?  That if some
company rented the car they are entitled to read whatever papers I have in
there?  What about a hotel?  A leased apartment?  A restraunt back room?  I
challenge the "ownership gives the owner the right to all that occurs or is
produced on or in the property" premise because it is just not a valid one,
legally or (in my opinion) ethically.

I know of many companies, consulting, law firms, accounting firms, in which
employees own their own machines, laptops for example, or PDAs.  Even where
this is not the case, I still resist the premise that ownership of a
computer translates to ownership of all the data thereon.  I'm sure hackers
would love it if they got title to all the data they download.
Unfortunately for this position it just doesn't work that way, nor should
it.  I suppose ISPs could take the position that encrypted data on their
systems must also be encrypted with the ISPs root key.  Are you telling me
you'd not have a problem with that because the ISP owns all the data on its
systems?

Actually, most large modern firms I'm familiar with approve of and expect
some degree of personal business to be transacted in the work place.  Some
even state this explicitly in their corporate policies and define the level
of personal business that is appropriate.  Never have I seen one which
insists that no personal business of any kind is to be tolerated.  I doubt
such a firm would have a reasonable retention rate either.

I think I might take that as a compliment coming from someone who advocates
the  kind of data ownership views that you seem to.  I hope to be thought
of as dangerous by those kind of entities.

Blame law school.

If my position on this issue makes me some kind of troublemaker, you better
point the same finger at Schneier, who (if quoted accurately) shares my view.

I do.  Unimparied privacy for individuals in all contexts.  Now tell me how
PGP5.5 contributes to that cause, particularly in the current political
climate.  The timing looks extremely suspect to me.  Challenging the
premise that corporates own the flesh and mind of every employee within the
walls of their facilities doesn't really strike me as something
pro-estlablishment or bearing the hallmarks of some sinister plot, unless
perhaps one is on a law-enforcement or far right corporate-facist spectrum.
 P2, the italian corporate-facist movement, held similar views after the
second world war, so your ideas are not new.  My view is, however, that
this is the wrong way for the world to progress.  If beliving that
employees don't sell their souls to large corporations because they accept
their paychecks is evil, call me evil.  At the same time I beleve that
companies don't tell their soul to a given government just because they do
business on a given "soil."  This strikes me as consistant.  Perhaps you
will disagree.

If correcting legal errors, highlighting the flaws in basic premises and
pointing out general gaps in logic, which is what I think I've been doing
for the many years I've been poking around on c'punks an elsewhere, is
disrupting and diverting, perhaps the "important discussions" are on the
wrong tact.

Glazing over the messy details of any policy, which seems to be what your
"disrupting and diverting some important discussion" clause is advocating,
is a rather sly tactic really.  "If all these privacy extremists would just
shut up about the details of our plan, we could get something done without
diversion and distraction."  Sound familiar?  Always look at those calling
for silence with suspicion.

Actually, I don't even usually proofread my stuff.  I'm pleased it gives
you the impression of some fine craftsmanship, or bears the indications of
some grand conspiracy, but in reality its off the top of my head.  The
consistancy you see is probably because I don't waiver in my principles
when it comes to privacy.

Clearly, any answer I deliver to this question only harms me.  I've seen
this trick before.

What kind of decoration?  Are you offering me one?  (Aside from "Snide
Asshole Lawyer of the Year" or something I mean).
