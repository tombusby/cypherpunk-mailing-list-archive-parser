No, it is not. The above paragraph totally misconstrues what I posted, 
and I am (again) putting it into the record with this post that I 
oppose all forms of premeditated killing.

What I posted was an idea for a POLL, nothing more. There was no
suggestion that of any kind of action or incentive - no advocacy
of murder, no anonymous cash, no payoffs, nothing. This is NOT 
'implementing a variant of assassination politics', and I take 
strong exception to your implication that I would support such 
a thing.

I really hate it when you misread, misconstrue, and misquote 
other people. You really seem to have a very tenuous love of truth
and accuracy when falsehood will serve your purpose better (if 
you think that sounds like the tactics of a certain large 
organization you dislike, you're right.)

Let's take just one paragraph from your latest screed. Can you back
up all or even most of the points in it? I don't think so. You wrote:

>The United States of America is the world's leading terrorist state.

Matter of opinion. I suspect that Libya, Iraq, and Iran are better
candidates. If you include internal terrorism, add China, North 
Korea, and many others ahead of the US.

>From mining harbors in countries with democratically elected
>governments... 

I've got only a quibble with this one. We did mine Managua, ie one
harbor in one country. While this was clearly unacceptable behaviour,
it does demonstrate your tendency to play fast and loose with 
numbers.

>...to financing the blowing up of airliners by dissident
>groups 

Really? Which ones? Be specific. Which airlines, which flights?
What were the circumstances in each case? You're using plurals 
again, so you'd better have multiple instances.

>...to assassinating dozens of leaders of countries the USA wished
>to shape in different directions, the USA is Terror State Numero Uno.

Dozens? As in 12+? Again, which ones? When? Any since the (Carter?) 
exec order forbidding attacks against heads of state?

Tim, can you back up your words with facts, or are your recent 
posts "... full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."?

There are sufficient *real* problems with US policy that 
your exaggerations are counter-productive.
