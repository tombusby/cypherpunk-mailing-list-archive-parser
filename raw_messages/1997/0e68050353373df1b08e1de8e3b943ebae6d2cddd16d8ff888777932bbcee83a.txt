Having spent the last ten years at this retail outfit, I can assure you
that "impossible to deploy" != "won't be deployed".  If Mastercard tells us
that they will jack our rates by 0.5% for every transaction processed
without SET, then management will demand SET be rolled out.  Function be
damned, security be damned, as long as some bookkeeper somewhere is
satisfied that SET happens, then we avoid a huge rate increase.

If the security of SET is questioned in the trade rags, our management's
approach will be to assume that Mastercard will fix it in the future, but
roll it out now anyway.  OTOH, it's obvious (even to them) that SET
couldn't possibly be any *less* secure than current authorizing techniques.

*Sigh*.  Look for copyrighted swirly red/orange logos to appear on
retailer's doors' soon:  
    "SET(tm) Transaction Processing -- 
     It's safe to use your Mastercard here"

John, who will get dragged into implementing it.  Got any suggestions?
