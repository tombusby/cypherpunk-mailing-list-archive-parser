I don't doubt that remailers need to be strengthened to support a "classic 
AP" system.  However, complicating (or, perhaps, simplifying; depending on 
your point of view...) the issue is the fact that an AP-type system is going 
to be inherently self-protecting:  Even if I wasn't inclined to donate to 
see the death of anybody else, I'd want to protect the underlying system to 
ensure its continued existence.

I (and some others) are convinced that an AP-system would totally eliminate 
the series of tyrannies that governments have been throughout history.  
That, if true, is a _very_ valuable accomplishment to most of us, one for 
which we'd be wise to pay to achieve.  And generally, where there is a 
demand, a free market supplies that desire with a product.
