Not clear how much privacy this buys you.  If one party sues the other,
it's some protection.  But if both parties are hauled into court and
accused of some crime, it's going to be clear enough which party sent
the mail.  Yes, technically it could have been forged by the other party,
but people have been convicted on evidence a lot shakier than this.

Sounds complicated.  It will be years before the legal system is able
to handle these subtleties.  Ordinary digital signatures are challenging
enough.

Torn ecash?

With torn ecash, Bob withdraws $100 from his account, but in such a way
that Alice has some crucial information needed to unblind it.  If they
can't come to a meeting of the minds, Bob is out the $100 and Alice is
out the time she spent on the project.  This removes much of the incentive
each has to cheat the other, and gives them an incentive to cooperate.
