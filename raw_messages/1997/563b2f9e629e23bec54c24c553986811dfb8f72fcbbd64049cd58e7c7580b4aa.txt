As a marylander, in particular, a baltimoron, I am both embarrassed
and annoyed that these legislative bozos have the unmitigated gall
to expend time and energy on pursuits such as these.  Perhaps they
feel that our state attorney general needs to earn his excessive
salary by attempting to defend this constitutionally indefensible
mental excrement.  Did the defeat of CDA not resonate?
