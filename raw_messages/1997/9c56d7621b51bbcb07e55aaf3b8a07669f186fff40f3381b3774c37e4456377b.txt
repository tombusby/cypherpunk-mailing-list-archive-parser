At least one PGP site overseas did that - some German university
scanned in a copy of the MIT Press publication of PGP source.
The PGP 3.0 Pre-Alpha code is now available, on paper, from PGP Inc.

Selling copies of PGP overseas, even if exported this way,
might count as "providing a defense service", if that's still illegal
now that crypto export laws have been moved to Commerce Dept.
On the other hand, indemnifying people against copyright suits
from your company _doesn't_ sound like it.... :-)
