 Right to Privacy for Sale in Cyberspace; SynData Technologies Inc. 
 Speaks Out  Against Key Recovery

 Cedar Grove, N.J. -- SynData Technologies Inc., a provider of encryption 
 software solutions, released a statement today condemning Network 
 Associates Inc. for supporting the government's key recovery program. 
 Network Associates recently purchased Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).
 PGP had historically been opposed to key recovery. 

 "It is time to seriously consider the threat that Network Associates poses
 to the individual's constitutional right to privacy," said David Romanoff, CEO 
 of SynData Technologies Inc. "While Network Associates claims to protect
 privacy in cyberspace, they have actually traded our right to privacy for a 
 shot at increased revenues overseas by supporting the key recovery program. 
 The slippery slope has begun right under our noses. It's time to challenge 
 both the government and companies who support the government's key
 recovery program before it is too late." 

 "The government's key recovery program is a complete violation of the
 individual's right to privacy and, in fact, compromises of the system are 
 already taking place. This shows that key escrow is an untenable policy," 
 said Bruce Schneier, one of the world's leading authorities on encryption 
 and author of the book "Applied Cryptography". "SynData is paving the
 way for other software developers by taking a stand in opposition to the 
 government and companies like Network Associates."
