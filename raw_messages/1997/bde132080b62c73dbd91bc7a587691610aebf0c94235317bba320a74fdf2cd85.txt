The police are supposed to handle it, or something.  Call 911 here while a criminal shoots your kids, while the ass on the other end asks questions until they hear a shot go off, and silence creep in.

That's why people use firearms.

I ask for the honor of memorizing 1984.

Now they have new Communist/Socialist/Fascist propaganda and other programs around the U.S..  Ever hear of that shit with kids turning in toy rifles, weapons of destruction, for books?  I read books as a child, and still, i had toy rifles.

Of course the kids were spewing out the Usual UN Globalism, totalitarian, and disarmament shit.  "I think dat guns are bad, they kill people."  the question is: What people?  As far as I see it, fascists, and freedom-thefters.

Obvious from the cry of freedom from McVeigh, destroying the minions of the fascists, and of course only being shown as a child killing monster.

Knowing friends of relatives who lived in East germany, they have many stories to tell.

I believe one of americas founders (a faggot, by word of Patrick Oonk, a Nazi) once asked this about britain putting taxes on breathing.  Soon after, we fought back and eventually sent those murdering sons of bitches running.

That day will live in my mind as being the day we all said ENOUGH!!!!

No wonder the suicide rate is up.

Well, we alread have shit like this.

Now.

May those cops burn in the pits of hell.

>What next?  And how soon?

Telescreens?  Thought Police?  Junior Scouts?  Eastasia and Eurasia?  INGSOC, Death-Worship, and Neo-Bolshevism?  How long before we get helicopters looking in windows?  How long before Two-Minutes hate?  How long before we have the Party?  how long before we have the Sex restrictions?  How long before our children become blind followers?  After all, communism's laws are 1. infiltrate the school system 2. sit back and watch. How long before we all become enslaved, without knowing?

Soon.  very Soon.

LOCK AND LOAD.  Shoot to kill.

Sometimes, we fight back, even if there is no hope.  Why?  Because it is better to die on our feet than to live on our knees.

The first days of the last days of freedom are now.

Will we win?  I say yes. Fascists say no.

The war is underway.
