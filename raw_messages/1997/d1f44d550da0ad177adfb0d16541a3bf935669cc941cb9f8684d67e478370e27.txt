An experts' study of the risks presented by key escrow and key recovery was
released this morning and is now available on the Web at

THE RISKS OF KEY RECOVERY, KEY ESCROW, AND TRUSTED THIRD PARTY ENCRYPTION

        Report By Leading Cryptographers and Computer Scientists Says
            Government Encryption Plan Is Risky and Impractical

On Wednesday May 21, a group of leading cryptographers and computer
scientists released a report examining the risks and implications of
government-driven key-recovery systems.

The report cautions that, "The deployment of a general key-recovery-based
encryption infrastructure to meet law enforcement's stated requirements
will result in substantial sacrifices in security and cost to the end user.
Building a secure infrastructure of the breathtaking scale and complexity
demanded by these requirements is far beyond the experience and current
competency of the field."

The report's authors, recognized leaders in the fields of cryptography and
computer science, include Hal Abelson, Ross Anderson, Steven M. Bellovin,
Josh Benaloh, Matt Blaze, Whitfield Diffie, John Gilmore, Peter G. Neumann,
Ronald L. Rivest, Jeffery I. Schiller, and Bruce Schneier.

HOW TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THE REPORT

The report is available online at http://www.crypto.com/key_study/
and printed copies will also be available through the Center for
Democracy and Technology.
