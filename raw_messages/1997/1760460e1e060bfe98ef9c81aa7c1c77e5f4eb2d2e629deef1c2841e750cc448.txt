>> Unfortunately these people just don't get it. Corporations refused

>> Without corps buying the product, there is no PGP, Inc., and thus

>> They also don't seem to realize that you always have the ability

>> Sometimes I really feel like screaming at these people. _All_ of

>> likes the idea of the MRK. That is why we refuse to make them
>> required. It is also why there still are freeware and personal
>> versions of the product. I wish they would just realize that we
>> aren't some evil group of people that are solely plotting how to
>> make the most money off of this. Most everyone at PGP has
>> internalized personal privacy as a cause (actually most had it
>> before they joined PGP).

>> *sigh* OK, enough ranting. Feel free to quote various parts of
