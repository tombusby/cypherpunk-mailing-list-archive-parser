Should anyone attend the BXA meeting in DC referenced below, 
we'd be grateful for a report, handouts and minutes, especially 
on encryption regulation and implementation of the Wassenaar 
Arrangement -- whose issuance is now overdue.

A "Wassenaar Plenary" is scheduled for sometime in December 
as well, with a "Wassenaar list review" in May 1998, according 
to minutes of the October 21 meeting of the Information Systems 
Technical Advisory Committee:
