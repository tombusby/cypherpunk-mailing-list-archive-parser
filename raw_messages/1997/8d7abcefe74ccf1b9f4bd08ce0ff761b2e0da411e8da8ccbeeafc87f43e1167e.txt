Grafitti is criminal (although many of us probably do things that are
'criminal' under some silly law or other), it is definately very
annoying and I wouldn't like someone spraying it on my front door, but
shooting people for it is a bit over the top I think.

Grafitti (as in writing your name on or in something that you don't
own) has existed for ages. Only since the invention of spraypaint has
it become a big problem. Technology can also provide a solution.
Surfaces can be treated so that grafitti can easily be removed. All
this of course costs money, but that is, imho, the price of being part
of a pile of millions of people, ie. a city.

Another solution, which works very well for shopfronts over here, is
to actually contract and pay a grafitti gang to spray the shops logo
or whatever on the front (or steel blinds).

Shooting people for this will probably only make them shoot back,
which will ony result in overworked morgue employees and/or high
hospital bills.
