I can't read this paragraph without shaking my head in awe. Even if their
motives were for the best, which is certainly debateable, who here _can't_
think of a few incidents where our own government's agencies were involved
in _exactly_ these sorts of activities?  I realize that I'm not saying
anything that hasn't been noted time and again in this forum, but I
suppose I'm young enough that this sort of blatant doublespeak just blows
my mind.
