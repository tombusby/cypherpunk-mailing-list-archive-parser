Such was the thrust of my question posed to the Senate hearings via netcast:
"Is secret speed protected speech"

For if not, then it is a simple matter by extension to require that all

preposterous.

The respondent seemed to think that 'secret speech' is protected, but 
obviously there are counterarguments.
