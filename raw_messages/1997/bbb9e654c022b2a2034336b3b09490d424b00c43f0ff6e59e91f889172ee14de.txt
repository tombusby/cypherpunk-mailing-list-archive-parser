I'm curious -- how would you know whether he's done so or not?  I don't 
recall you making that invitation to him.  Do you even accept incoming
e-mail from remailers?

Maybe it's time for Alex to join this thread and either say "no, we don't
filter on any words at the Replay remailer", or else "yes, here's a list
of the words we consider to be objectionable, so please omit them from
your posts through the Replay remailer".

I'm half expecting that his posts aren't showing up either because he's
screwed something up in the message to the remailer (like misspelling the
word "Newsgroups" in the header, for example), because the posting
gateway is flaky, or because some Net Nazi has taken it upon himself to
indiscriminately forge cancels to posts he doesn't like.  But some definitive 
word, one way or the other, would go a long way towards clarifying this
situation.  I see no rational reason for covertly blocking posts based on
content.  *IF* he didn't want something posted, then an announcement that
the Replay remailer rejects posts containing certain words or phrases
would make life simpler for all concerned.

And to whoever created the subject line for this message, I'm tempted to
either post the word "fool", or say that it's a lousy "Mr. T" impression. :)
