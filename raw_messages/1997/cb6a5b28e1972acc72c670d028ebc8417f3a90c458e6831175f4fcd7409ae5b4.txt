Now let's see here.  You've posted to this list (F-C) a half dozen 
times in the last few months, each time with a different name and 
with a different and invalid return address.  And you speak of 
reputation capital?  Go tell your mommy you've been bad.

I see you've succumbed to the tunnel vision, selective blindness of 
the libertarian sect.  Repeat after me: just because we live in a 
society with a government, doesn't mean that everything you don't 
like is the government's fault and that all problems will be solved 
by the mythical free-market beast if only the evil government would 
leave it alone.

Feel free to point out a counter-example.  I wrote quickly, and 
without research - perhaps I'm wrong.
