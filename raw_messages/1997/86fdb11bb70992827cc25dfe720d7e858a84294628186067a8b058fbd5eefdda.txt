I got something very similar from a friend who is much higher on the
technological food chain than myself.  He also told me that there was this
big fair/trade-show/political rally that everyone attended.  Once a year I
think.  That in addition to stopping by three houses to report the killing
the killer had to report it at the next of these events to occur.  It was
also suggested that the compensation was a fairly fixed amount but that a
person who could afford it and really didn't want trouble from the heirs of
the deceased could pay more, thus suggesting that he considered the deceased
to be more valuable than the average man.  Sort of a post-mortem complement
by the killer.
Also, according to what I remember, the "protection company" was your
extended family.  Pay up or face the wraith of all the deceased's cousins,
nephews, uncles, neices, aunts, maybe his kids.
I would love to get more information on this, however, the friend who told
me this much has left this little school for the larger waters of Oklahoma
State University where he is in the engineering pod.
