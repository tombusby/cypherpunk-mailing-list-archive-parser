	( non-US residents, tune out ... )

	This is the way it ( the constitution ) was written to work; however, 
the feds have found an interesting way around this.  Here, in two easy steps,
is their secret backdoor through the constitution:

	Step 1:	Take our money in federal taxes.

	Step 2:	Refuse to give it back to us unless we follow their guidelines.

	It's been done time and time again, "for our own good".  Witness the
country-wide drinking age of 21 ( if states don't enact it, they lose their
highway funds ), or the upcoming welfare "return" to the states.

	So, while the Federal government doesn't enact the legislation, they
have a big enough stick to force states and local govt. to bend to their
"suggestion".

	Sorry.
