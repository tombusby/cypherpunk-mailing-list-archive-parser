And the longer the wait the better.  Some have complained that the
status quo situation of export restrictions was unacceptable.  Yet
the spread of crypto has largely been unrestrained -- a stay of
execution so to speak.  The longer the status quo remains, the more
ubiquitous crypto becomes and future legislative efforts are
undermined.

That said, I think these organizations made a strategic error.  Had a
draconian bill been introduced first, opposition probably would have
played out differently in the press.  We saw this with Clipper.

I believe commercial interests played a large part in the push for
legislation.

Just another player in the game, I suppose.

You almost sound surprised.  Did they really think Congressman would
understand crypto?  Congressmen _do_ understand law and order and
protecting poor defenseless children from porn.  They understand
preventing "another Oklahoma.   And it's an easy sell to their
constituencies, too.

The average schmoe may indeed *want* more freedom, but he also he wants
to be protected.  And he also has a limited understanding of the
equation.  The easiest explanation wins, of course.

Some people just don't get it.  You'll never gain more freedom through
more legislation.
