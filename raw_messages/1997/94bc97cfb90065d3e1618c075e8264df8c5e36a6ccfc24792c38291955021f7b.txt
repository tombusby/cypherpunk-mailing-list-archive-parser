I wonder how many of them know if their mail can be read now?  Any admin
could just use `less /var/spool/mail/andyg` to read the unencrypted mail
queue.

There will always be an out for management.  Managers will not like the
idea of someone being able to read their mail, thus, they will make rules
that they do not have to follow.  (People who think that such rules will be
equally enforced have never worked for a big company.) 

But the higher up the corporate ladder, the bigger risk that they will have
more info to sell out to the competition.  

This sort of policy is only to tighten management's grip on the proles, not
solve any real problem within the corporation.  (Kind of like drug testing,
but without all that messy urine.)

But those who will make the rules will not think through those issues.
Those decisions will be made for totally alien reasons.  Control will be a
big one.  Because it is there will be another.  The corporate GAKware
features of 5.5 will be a big thing with the management types who think it
is a good thing to measure workers keystrokes and monitor their precious
bodily fluids.
