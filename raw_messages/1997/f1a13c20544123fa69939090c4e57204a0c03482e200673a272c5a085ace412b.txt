If these parents DID care, then why in the hell WOULD they put them in a
federal building?  If I remember fully a past post (i forget which, and
my memory ISN'T perfect) that place (the building) had been threatened
by numerous attacks, and yet these ignorant parents put their kids in
there.  I would put my kid a regular day care.  If someone blew up a
regular daycare, then they ARE fucked up.  He wasn't attacking a DAY
CARE, his midn was on blowing up the federals in there.  I'm not
JUSTIFYING killing children.  Who knows whether or not it will be
beneficial to the anti-federal cause.  Geiger gave a few examples.  To
accomplish some things you gotta break a few eggs (Tim May's post).  Not
that it's right to do it, but things happen.
