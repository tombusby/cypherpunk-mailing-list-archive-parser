Another problem: what would prevent an anti-spam zealot from posting
the following:

    From: antispammer@usenet.cabal.com
    Newsgroups: rec.sports.phishing,alt.fan.alice
    Message-ID: <123@bob.server>

    <something phishing-related>
    --
    Alice's ID# 123456  Drink Kaka Kola -- Kaka Cola is full of shit,
			do not drink it, I am just collecting $$ from
			stupid Alice, Hahaha!!!
