Oh yes, I can.  In fact, I believe the opposite is the case.  The
statistics bear this out.  But, your claim was that a weapon will
eventually be used to kill somebody.  I guess it's clear at this point
that this was wildly inaccurate.

You should come to the United States and spend some time around the
shooting community.  The people are real pleasant, real easy to get
along with, and real careful with their weapons.

That can occur, but in general nobody likes to be shot.  Even if you
are going to shoot your opponent regardless, if he has a gun you move
more cautiously.

What would have happened if the Russians didn't develop nuclear
weapons?  I think they would have been nuked sooner or later, don't
you?

And, we aren't talking about an arms race, here.  We are talking about
whether citizens are allowed to own a few rifles.

You will find this difficult to achieve, however.

You are not talking about disarming the police and the military are
you?  Just as I thought: you only want to disarm the civilians.
That's not such a great idea, judging by history.

Are you arguing that the Dutch resistance should not have resisted?  I
believe they did the right thing, myself.  I do not believe it was a
Bad Thing.  I believe it was a Good Thing.  I believe they did not
kill enough people.

No, but it appeared that you may have been misled by them.

Police violence is caused by gun ownership?  I doubt this very much.

>Over her, drive-by shootings are something from fairy tales.

Oddly enough, this is mostly true here as well.

It is unclear what is magical about the words "drive by shooting."  I
believe this phrase lacks real content and is simply a trigger for
hysteria.

The implication is that people are randomly firing on people in the
streets.  While this may occur once in a great while, it is extremely
uncommon.  Usually people kill for a reason.  Usually they are trying
to kill their enemies.  In the U.S., this is often related to the
black market.

Whether somebody kills their enemy from a car or not is irrelevant.
