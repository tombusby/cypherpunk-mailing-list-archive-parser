The line above this one says it all, doesn't it?  If I judge you to
be "an idiot", then, if I also have the power to shut you up, I can
not only shut off your "noise" from me, but also prevent anyone else
from hearing you as well.  That's the real beauty of censorship -
if I have the power, I can make you a non-person by preventing most
people from hearing you at all.  Oh, lovely, isn't it?
