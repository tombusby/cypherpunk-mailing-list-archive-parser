My lord, I'm agreeing with Jim Bell!

Right now, no controls exit on domestic crypto, though strict export
controls are in place.

The question is: Do we want to give up any domestic freedom in exchange
for a relaxation of export controls? (Congress is, after all, built on
compromises between warring factions.)

My instinct is to say "No." Let the courts strike down ITAR, EAR, and its
progeny, while we keep our freedoms domestically.
