This provides no anonymity with respect to the bank, right?  The bank
knows who is paying whom.  That's not very valuable IMO.  The bank is
still a centralized place where all this transaction information exists,
a fat target for privacy opponents.  I'd say that anonymity to the
bank is more important than anonymity to the merchant for this reason.
So I think you're going at this backwards.

The big question with identity certificates is what procedures were followed
in verifying the identity when the cert was issued.  If the CPA publishes
some standard method, and his reputation is strong enough that people will
trust him to follow it, then it might well be worth money to you to have
him sign it.  This is the traditional role of the Certification Authority.

It depends on the circumstances where you expect to use your key.  Within
a small to medium circle of associates there may be some group members
who sign keys and are trusted by other members of the group.  There is
no particular reason for it to be difficult.  If you want a signature which
will be accepted by everyone in the U.S. you have a harder problem.
