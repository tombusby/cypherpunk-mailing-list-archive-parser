Hard currency is disappearing from many everyday transactions along the

By Peter S. Gemmell
One method of making electronic cash transactions private for honest users but

In your pocket: smartcards
By Carol Hovenga Fancher
A wallet full of cash, credit, and identification cards may, in the future,
be replaced
with two or three smartcards, each containing an IC, as a recent flurry of
market
tests and smartcard rollouts demonstrates.

Banking in cyberspace: an investment in itself
By Michael C. McChesney
While home banking has been around for some time, Internet banking is a new
concept, and has a number of advantages.

Technology takes to securities trading

By Mike Ter Maat
Electronic cash can create profits for its issuers, and launch competition
for today's
government-controlled currency systems.
