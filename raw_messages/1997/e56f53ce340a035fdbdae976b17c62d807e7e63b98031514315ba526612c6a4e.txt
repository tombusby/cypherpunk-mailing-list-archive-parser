     The Scientific Freedom, Responsibility, and Law Program of the
     American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is
     conducting an on-line survey to learn more about the uses of anonymity
     and pseudonymity on the Internet.  The survey, together with a series
     of focus group meetings and an invitational conference, is part of a
     project being funded by the National Science Foundation.  The project
     will generate a set of criteria describing the contexts in which
     anonymous and pseudonymous communications are desirable, permissible,
     or undesirable, and a set of guidelines for the use of anonymous and
     pseudonymous communications in those situations where their use is to
     be encouraged or at least tolerated.  Please visit the Project website
     to learn more about this timely project and tell us about your
     experiences with anonymity or pseudonymity:

     Founded in 1848, the AAAS is a nonprofit scientific society dedicated
     to the advancement of scientific and technological excellence, and to
     the public's understanding of science and technology.  AAAS is the
     world's largest federation of scientific and engineering societies,
     with nearly 300 affiliates.  In addition, AAAS has a membership of
     more than 143,000 scientists, engineers, science educators,
     policymakers, and interested citizens dedicated to scientific and
     technological progress in service to society.  AAAS is the publisher
     of the prestigious, peer-reviewed, weekly journal, SCIENCE.
