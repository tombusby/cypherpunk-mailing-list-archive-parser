  Obviously, no one has informed the night janitor at VME that regular
list subscribers generally just put Toto's email address in replies to
particularly cowardly and/or stupid anonymous posts, since we then have
a 90% chance of having sent it to the right person.

  As an act of mercy toward Toto, I will personally correct the spelling
and grammar in the night-janitor's post and forward it to the madman
at 'Che(z) Sympatico.'

  According to a claim by TruthMonger, Dr. Vulis found the backdoor in 
VME's encryption program, and the test message contained a plea for
donations from the Georgia Cracker remailer operators.
  I was originally skeptical about this claim, until sources at C2Nut
confirmed it.
