  And, in spite of this, you're going to suggest more of the

  A lot of people give away their televisions to burglars, and their

  Sounds like a good, old-fashioned cypherpunks pissing contest
to me. Better lay in extra beer.

  This is wonderful! At last the cypherpunks have a leader who can 
speak for all of us.
  When does the New List Moderation begin? I'm going to have to lay
