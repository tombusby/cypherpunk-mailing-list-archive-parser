While this report may be true, I wonder if it's not a spoof or even
official disinformation to mislead about the details of Aaron's mission 
as well as what Rainbow and others are really peddling to
rabble-fearing paranoids.

This last sentence seems a bit too melodramatic even for a suck-up
crippled-chip manufacturer:

>The MYK-82, developed by Mykotronx and fabricated by VLSI Technology,
>Inc., is the first of a series of security products to be developed as
>part of an alliance with the NSA, targeting both Government and
>commercial citizen monitoring markets.

Granted that defense to LEA-market conversionists like to pornograph the 
godawful carnage their technology can wreak on disobedient civilians to 
arouse ex-military-to-LEA converted glands -- do they actually write SOF 
drool like this?
