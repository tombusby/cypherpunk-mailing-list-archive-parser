GSM DATA FEATURES
GSM is particularly suited for mobile data communications.  All GSM base
systems support 9.6kbit/s circuit-switched data services, soon many will
increase transmission speed up to 28.8kbit/s. A new part of the GSM
standard, known as High Speed Circuit Switched Data (HSCSD), is being
developed which will boost user capacity up to 64 kbit/s, and higher.
        Interconnecting this 64 kbit/s wireless capability with public ISDN
networks, for example, will give mobile users complete end-to-end digital
connectivity with the attendant benefits of very fast set-up times and high
link quality.
        Technically, HSCSD requires a new radio link protocol; a
modification of the existing protocol used to provide the GSM voice
channel. GSM uses TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) technology, which
divides each 200 kHz carrier into eight timeslots. To provide a single
voice channel, one timeslot is used; one timeslot is also used to provide a
single 9.6 kbit/s data circuit. However, all eight slots will be used to
provide one 64 kbit/s circuit.
     The main benefit of this approach is that it is designed for the
existing GSM infra-structure. There is no need for operators to change
their entire network infrastructure in order to implement it. Operators
will therefore be able to implement HSCSD in a quick and efficient way,
once the specification has been ratified.

ENCRYPTED GSM LINKS
If the GSM phone includes a data port, as some already do, just connect
your laptop, dial your ISP and 'push' the encrypted traffic over that link
(e.g., using TCP/IP and PGPfone).
