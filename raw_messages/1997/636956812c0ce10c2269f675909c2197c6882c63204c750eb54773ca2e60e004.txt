  Sounds like he is only objecting to you discussing issues important
to you with groups you belong to and groups that you *don't* belong to.
  Sounds like Chelsea is pushing daddy's fascist agenda at Stanford.

  Because fickless ducks live in fear of individuals who threaten
their ability to hide under phantom security blankets.

  Often, it is just the result of people who come up with some inane
brainstorm that looks good on the surface, but are too intellectually
lazy to think it through and resent anyone who does so (thus destroying
their petty work of self-proclaimed 'genius'.
  The real losers end up doing a lot of campaigning to make up for the
insufficiency of their logic, under the delusion that getting as many
others as possible to jump on their bandwagon will somehow increase
their low level of self-esteem.

  Sounds to me like the dweeb is pissed because he had to do a lot
of blather-spamming to overcome the effects of Igor's rational
and balanced posts on the subject.
  Perhaps his next project could be to promote a vote on a new
value for 'pi'.
