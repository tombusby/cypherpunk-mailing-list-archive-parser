Excellent opener.  I was born in Singapore and have lived here most of my 
life.

Truth alert:  Yes, the govt is heavily involved in the economy - for example
Singapore Technologies (aerospace, silicon foundries, armaments), Sembawang 
Corp (shipbuilding, realestate, heavy engineering).  The truth behind these
companies is that about 15-30% of them are owned by the govt of Singapore's
investment arm, Temasek Holdings.  The rest are held by other companies (both
local and foreign) as well as the general public - i.e., these are listed on
the stock exchange.  

Indeed the govt does get into industries that it feels are critical for 
Singapore's survival.  This is the classic Singapore Inc operating.  For
example, late in the last decade, there was no private company doing wafer
fabicration.  The Singapore Technologies company, Chartered Semiconductor
started the first fab plant.  No other private company wanted to do it alone
but after that plant came up and became profitable (years later), there are
now numerous fabs either in operation or under construction by international
companies.  So, yes, the govt does at times choke the entrepreneurship drive
of the local population, but there are industries where the coexistence of
private initiative and govt-linked companies have been possible and viable.

Perhaps you need to go to Woodbridge (for the uninformed, Woodbridge
is where the local mental institution is located).  

Let's analyze the premise of an educational system.  I am a product of
this system and tempered with a dose of undergrad/grad school experience
in the US.  Any educational system thrives to create as its output, 
valuable citizens who can be self-supporting and useful (label it anyway
you want - worker units as you say is fine).  It has been a fine balance
between a fully liberal system and one that generates worker units for
the most part of the last 30-35 years.  The system erred to the latter.
The thinking today (you see I continue to choose to live here) is that
that model is flawed and needs to be tampered with.  It will take 5-10
years before an increasingly liberal system is in place - an increasing
thinking population that is part of the global information flow that will
characterize the next centuries economies.

Not true the 2nd last statement.  The population is perhaps more tolerant
to failures or perhaps not informed about such because of the joke of a
press we have.

As a private citizen, I cannot own a gun without a license.  *I* have
no problems with that.  Colour (we spell it with a u) copiers are
not restricted by any means.  Yes, media is controlled by the govt -
except for the 24 hour BBC world service radio broadcast on FM here.
Banning of magazines and newspapers are there - but you can continue
to get it over the net unfettered and uncensored.

Any problems with the "mandatory" savings?  I don't.  The money is
mine - I can use it almost immediately to buy stocks, pay for my home
etc etc.  I don't see no problem.  National service - I did my time
but perhaps the initial duration can be reduced from 2.5 years at
age 18 but it has helped to create a population that better prepared
mentally and physically to be able to defend the country if the need
arises. 

Pray tell me how the SG govt has brought BB into reality?  I love such
generalizations especially from a person who claims to have lived here
for 8 years.   I lived in the Pacific Northwest for about 7 years and
I will not make such statements.

Interesting that you hide behind an anomymous name and you claim to
be outside Singapore.  I for one, will stand by my name and say that
things I should say about this country of mine (warts and all) and
not have to hide behind anonymity (not that I would not use anonymity
ever :-)).
