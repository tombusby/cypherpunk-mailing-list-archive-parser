That would be nice.  I wonder, could one of our list hosts add a
script to sign outgoing majordomo traffic?

Here's a script to do it:

- --------------------8<--------------------
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
$userID="cypherpunks\@algebra.com";
$pgp="/usr/local/bin/pgp";
$tmp="/tmp/.sig$$";
undef($/);
$post = <STDIN>;
($headers,@body) = split(/\n\n/,$post);$body = join("\n\n",@body);
open(PIPE,"|$pgp -satf +batchmode +verbose=0 -u $userID > $tmp");
print PIPE $body;
close(PIPE);
open(SIGNED,"<$tmp");$signed=<SIGNED>;close(SIGNED);
print "$headers\n\n$signed";
unlink($tmp);
- --------------------8<--------------------

It handles one mail only.  If you want to run it on a mail folder, use
formail.

You could do something similar with independent parties posting hashes
of messages in the feed they got to the list, or to subscribers to the
service.

The list bot signing is more convenient to check though with existing
software.  Also, unfortunately, most MUA pgp software doesn't check
nested signatures, so a signature from the list would break ability to
auto check signatures from posters.

Here's another script to check the list added signature on receipt:

- --------------------8<--------------------
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
$userID="cypherpunks\@algebra.com";
$pgp="/usr/local/bin/pgp";
$tmp="/tmp/.sig$$";$in="/tmp/.in$$";$msg="/tmp/.msg$$";
undef($/);
$post = <STDIN>;
($headers,@body) = split(/\n\n/,$post);$body = join("\n\n",@body);
open(BODY,">$in");print BODY $body;close(BODY);
$res = system("$pgp -f +batchmode +verbose=0 -u $userID < $in > $tmp 2> $msg");
open(SIGNED,"<$tmp");$signed=<SIGNED>;close(SIGNED);
open(ERR,"<$msg");$err=<ERR>;close(ERR);
if ($res==0) {
    ($who) = ($err =~ m/Good signature from user "(.*)"\./);
    if ($who !~ m/$userID/) { $res=1; }
}
$headers =~ s/\[FORGERY\]//g;
if ($res) {
    $headers =~ s/(Subject: )([^\n]*)/\1\[FORGERY\] \2/g;
}
print "$headers\n";
print "X-Signature: ", $res ? "forgery" : "ok $who", "\n";
print "\n\n$signed\n";
unlink($tmp,$in,$msg);
- --------------------8<--------------------

Yes.  Except for minor nit: 0x4D162BBE1 is susceptible to a 0xdeadbeef
attack, anyone can generate another key with that keyID.  Even the
fingerprint is spoofable.  But the combination is truly hard to spoof,
and this I do own: 0xa11a8a18bf6dbe8362926e9458a3616d/0x4d162bbe1
(fingerprint/keyID).
