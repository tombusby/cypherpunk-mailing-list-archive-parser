Silly things happen when one responds literally to an obvious 
metaphor.  (see, "analogy.")

Nonsense.  Richard may have read my response on the Unedited list
and Paul post on the Moderated list, but I sent my response to
each list in the appropriate order, Paul's post, followed by my 
response.  In any event, how would intentionally reversing the 
order have benefited me?  This specious argument makes no sense.

Nope, wrong again.  I referenced sophistry and hypocracy.  I 
leave the significance of the difference as an exercise to the
student.  (Hint: one is an argument to the man, the other isn't.)

And wrong yet again.  Not a personal attack but commentary on 
wooly thinking.

One might read my posts on this point and pay attention.
