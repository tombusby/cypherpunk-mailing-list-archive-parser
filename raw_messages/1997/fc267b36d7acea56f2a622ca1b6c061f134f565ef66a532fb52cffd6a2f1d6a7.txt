So long as they are in someone elses home they do not. This is not an
issue of harm to the child this is a issue of it's my house and if you
don't like it get out.

The very nature of acting in public removes any expectation of privacy.

Of course.

Nope, public officials are employees of the citizens. As such the citizens
have a right to monitor what they do.

Yes, and the boundaries should be very few. Things like just because you
own a hammer doesn't give you the right to hit people over the head. But
as far as setting policies on how a resource can be used and what
conditions must be met before using them it should be without limit. If
you don't like it the don't use it and go get your own.

>Does the user of a resource have rights outside the purvue of the owner
>of that resource and if so what are the boundaries?

No they do not. If the user of a resource does not like the conditions set
by the owner for the use of that resource then they should not use it.

Never truer words were spoken.
