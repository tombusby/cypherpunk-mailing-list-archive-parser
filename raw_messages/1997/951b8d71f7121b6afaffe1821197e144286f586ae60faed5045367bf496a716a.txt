           Worcester Polytechnic Institute
                 5-Day Short Course

        APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY

          Seminar Leader: Dr. Christof Paar


Many of today's information technology applications have data security
as a central system requirement. Applications such as wireless computer
networks, electronic commerce, and many www applications rely heavily
on a high degree of system security.

This five-day course will provide you with an in-depth introduction to
the field of applied cryptography. Virtually all important aspects of
public-key and private-key algorithms as well as protocols will be
introduced. The course keeps the theoretical background and technical
applications well-balanced. You will leave the course with a solid,
broad knowledge of state-of-the-arts cryptography. You will have skills
to carefully choose and design a security scheme for a given
application.

Background Note: The seminar is based on a highly successful course
which has been taught to more than 150 professionals in industry and
graduate students on campus.



                  COURSE OUTLINE

protocols. Course summary.


                  WHO SHOULD ATTEND

Engineers and other technical professional who develop, implement, or
assess information security applications in software or hardware.
Technical managers who need a solid understanding of data security
issues will also greatly benefit from the course.


                 ABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR
