I'm not sure that this is so.

Ascii pic. consider Alice and Bob, without crowds:

        +----------+
        | Internet |
        +----------+
             | 2Mbits
          +-----+
          | ISP |
          +-----+
     28.8k/     \28.8k
         /       \
      +---+     +---+
      | A |     | B |
      +---+     +---+

When Alice and Bob are online, consider that they are actually using
their bandwidth most of the time.  I know I do; if I'm not using it I
hang up, with pay per second phone lines, you're likely to.

Now add in crowds where traffic from A is going through B, and traffic
from B is going through A:

                           +----------+
                           | Internet |
                           +----------+
                                 | 2Mbits
                              +-----+
                              | ISP |
                              +-----+
               14.4k for Alice/     \14.4k for Bob
                  14k for Bob/       \+14.4k for Alice
                          +---+     +---+
                          | A |     | B |
                          +---+     +---+

Now Bob and Alice each have 1/2 the bandwidth they had before.  Add
more users and longer hops and it gets worse.  Of course my claim that
Alice uses 100% of her bandwidth is probably an exaggeration.  There
will be idle times while she is reading.  However there will be times
when both Alice and Bob are downloading, for multiple users with
multiple hops it is likley that there will be more than one user
actively downloading at any time.

I'm sure it's going to increase the latency too.  My ping times are
200ms from the PPP link alone (ie pinging the PPP server machine
itself).  Add to this that the members of the jondo / crowds pool may
not be on the same ISP, and you've got the additional overheads of
whatever latency is added by the cumulative latency between each of
the hops in the chain.

This compromise is probably retains a fair amount of anonymity.  The
ISP probably isn't loggin IP traffic, or incoming or outgoing web
proxy (jondo/crowds) traffic, and probably isn't actively attacking
your jondo process to see which bits are for you and which are being
forwarded.

I wonder if you could improve the security of this by trading off
against some additional bandwidth consumption for the ISP.  Say have
split the jondo in half, with two cooperating half-Jondos acting as a
single virtual jondo in such a way that someone with root access on
one machine but not the other, can't extract any useful information by
spying on that half of the jondo.

Crowds migh scale in this way, but DC nets and Pipenets don't.  Crowds
is a weaker cousin of DC nets and Pipenets.
