I wouldn't go that far, but when a group of 10 punks armed with sawed-off,
nail-embedded baseball bats swaggers through the neighborhood, it would be
nice if the residents could disarm them and escort them to the middle of
the Mojave at gunpoint without falling afoul of the LEA's ourselves.

What part of "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed" is too hard to understand? (From 2nd Amendment, U.S. Constitution)

When everyone is armed, criminals fear everyone, not just the police.
