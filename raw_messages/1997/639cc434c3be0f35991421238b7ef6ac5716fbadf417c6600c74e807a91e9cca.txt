Year 2000 Solutions From India's Largest Software Consultancy

Tue, Sep 9, 1997, Vancouver, BC - Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's
largest global provider of software and software services, came to
Softworld 97 looking for potential clients in all areas of software needs,
including Year 2000. With their existing Y2K tool capabilities, coupled
with two upcoming announcements, Softworld 97 is providing TCS with an
excellent source for potential deals.   
TCS is already using its proprietary Y2K tools for projects involving: 

IBM Mainframe (OS/VS COBOL, COBOL II ETACOBOL, PL/1, ASSEMBLER, EASYTRIEVE,
MANTIS, TELON, SCEPTER, NATURAL, ADS/O, JCL, plus IDMS, IMS, DB2 and SUPRA) 
AS/400 (RPG, COBOL, CL, S/36, S/38, OCL) 
Tandem (COBOL, SCOBOL) 
DEC VAX (COBOL, POWERHOUSE) 
Honeywell-Bull (COBOL) 
Unix "C" 

In two weeks TCS will offer its AS/400 Y2K toolset, named Y2KIT/400, for
sale around the world as either a stand-alone product or bundled with
services. This tool suite has already proven its value in several
international projects involvimg millions of lines of code. 
On October 1st, TCS will open a "dedicated Y2K Factory" in Chennai
(formerly Madras), India. This facility will be unique in that it will have
1000 dedicated Indian software professionals, utilizing an IBM 9672-R44 (4
processor, CMOS) Mainframe, and equipped with a high-speed T1 satellite
link to North America. With 200 MLOC already under contract, this Center is
being commissioned to handle 1 Billion lines of code. 

"Our attendance at Softworld 97 could not have come at a more opportune
time," states Jim Thomas, TCS' Vice President of Marketing for North
America, "as there are numerous companies present with Y2K requirements."
