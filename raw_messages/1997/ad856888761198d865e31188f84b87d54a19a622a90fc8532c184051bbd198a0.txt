  Only asinine, dip-shit numbskulls would be capable of making this
idiotic
extrapolation.
  Why am I not surprised it came from Greg?

  More DoubleSpeak transposing the issues of Spam and content.

  No we're not, Greg. _You_ seem to be the only one speaking of
censorship
based on personality, agendas and content. (Try to keep in mind that the
thoughts and words of others are no longer being censored by your 
associates.)

  Toto is calling Greg a lying fuck who deliberately disseminates 
misinformation as to the stances taken by others. 
  Greg seem to have taken it upon himself to provide a misinterpretation
of the posts of others, even though those posts are available for people
to read for themselves, making their own judgements as to what they say.

  I have maintained from the beginning that there needs to be a
CypherPunks
list which is free from filtering in any way, shape or form.
  I have also maintained that the interests of crypto would also be
served
by the maintenance of lists which offer filtering services by those who
wish to provide them--even a CypherPunks-NoToto list.
  Anyone who read my post to Igor, suggesting that I would have no
problem
with him intercepting autobot-replies that result from mailbomb attacks,
also knows that I suggested even the empty spam-messages being deleted
should be stored where they are open to scrutiny, and that I, for one,
would indeed be scrutinizing them.

  For Greg to purport that the interception of mail-bomb attacks equates
somehow to content/personality censorship is unmitigated bullshit aimed
at the dim-witted (of which I believe there are very few of on any of
the CypherPunks lists).
  If Greg would like to put forth a logical train of thought which
compares
the interception of empty auto-bot messages generated in response to the
forged posts of a mailbomb attack with Sandy's fascist censorship
methods
(which Greg eloquently described, but misdirected their source), then I
would like to see it.

  Who is doing this, Greg? Name names. Give us an example of who is
doing
this and pretending not to do it. Why are your claims so vague?
