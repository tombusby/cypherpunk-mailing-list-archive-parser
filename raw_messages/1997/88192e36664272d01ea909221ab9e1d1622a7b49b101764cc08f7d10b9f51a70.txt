Funny thing is, if O.J. was, say, a bus-driver with food stamps, how long do you think *his* trial would be?

Besides, McVeigh's trial wasn't about truth or justice.  It was all about getting revenge, drawing blood, satisfying the bloodthirsty people of America.

McVeigh's lawyer was probably influenced (read: leaned on) by government fascists, so that McVeigh would die.

Very different from say, Atticus Finch, in "To Kill a Mockingbird".  He defended a black man, in a place and time very against that.  While this government controlled dickless loser that was McVeighs lawyer, didn't prosecute like a man, because then he'd be blacklisted and treated like shit.

If anyone out in this world feels like bumping off McVeighs lawyer, please do so.  We need less lawyers like him.
