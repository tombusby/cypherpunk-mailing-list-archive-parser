  This startling announcement ranks right up there at the top of the
'surprise' scale, along with K.D. Lang's announcement that she is gay.
(Like the Butch (crew-cut) hairstyle was not a major hint.)

  By the way, when I espoused my opinion that the moderation
announcement's
"your suggestions will be considered" was merely political rhetoric, I 
was offered (and took) a bet of 50,000 electronic porno byte-credits
on whether or not I was right.
  My opponent and I agreed that lack of any serious recognition of the
list
member's input would be taken as a sign of my supposition being correct.
I am of the belief that I have won the bet. Does anyone have any proof
to the contrary?
