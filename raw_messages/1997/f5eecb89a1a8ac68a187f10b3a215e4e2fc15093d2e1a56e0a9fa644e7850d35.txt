Wishful thinking, Doug.  Sandy will take an emotional (non-objective)
position on an issue, and argue it beyond any reasonable limit. I wish
I had all his replies to things I've said - you'd see what I mean.

Not to promote anyone who I might not be a friend of, but, there are
people on this list who are "well respected" who are light-years ahead
of Sandy in areas that are important for a list moderator.

Maybe Gilmore should have publicly announced for a moderator, and then
let the subscribers pick....
