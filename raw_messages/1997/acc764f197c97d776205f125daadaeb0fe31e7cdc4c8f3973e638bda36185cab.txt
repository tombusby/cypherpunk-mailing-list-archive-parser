   BRUSSELS, Belgium (September 8, 1997 11:21 a.m. EDT) - The top
   telecommunications official of the European Union called Monday for an
   international charter to regulate the Internet and other electronic
   networks.
   
   EU Commissioner Martin Bangemann, in a speech prepared for a
   telecommunications conference in Geneva, said the charter should deal
   with questions such as technical standards, illegal content, licenses,
   encryption and data privacy.
   
   "The current situation may lead to the adoption of isolated global
   rules with different countries signing up to different rules agreed
   under the auspices of different international organizations," the
   German commissioner said.
   
   "An international charter would provide a suitable answer."
   
   The text of the speech was distributed in Brussels.
   
   Bangemann said industry should lead the effort to draw up a charter,
   which would be based mostly on self-regulation and mutual recognition
   of national licenses.
   
   "Its role would not be to impose detailed rules, except in particular
   circumstances (child pornography, terrorist networks)," he said.
   
   The charter would recognize existing pacts negotiated within the World
   Trade Organization and World Intellectual Property Organization and
   draw on principles agreed by other bodies such as the Group of Seven
   top industrial countries, he said.
