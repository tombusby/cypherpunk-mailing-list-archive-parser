Try Sigma Chemical Company out of St. Louis, MO.  They are a large
supplier of very pure scientific supplies.  Contact them to see what their
policies are in selling non-lethal compounds to people off the street. 
Cadaverine is a by-product of protein fermentation by bacteria and is not
harmful.  If you are planning to bomb someone's home with it, it will
dissipate over a couple of days because it is so volatile.  Another source
is dog training supply houses, body-locating dogs are trained by use of
cadaverine and putrescine, another similar compound. Hope this helps.
