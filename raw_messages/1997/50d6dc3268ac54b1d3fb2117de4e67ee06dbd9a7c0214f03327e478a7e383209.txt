I absolute agree we need to be accurate. To that end, it is not the
applications that need security but rather the network and session layers.

He said 'application vendors', not just mail. Pay attention to the details
of the argument and quit trying to change the subject without specificaly
noteing the change, otherwise known as a strawman. His muddy thinking
doesn't stand alone.

I work everyday with the NSA, CIA, Dod, Army, SAIC, all the phone companies,
many of the major banks, Intel, Human Genome Project, etc. Every one of these
folks would disagree with you. In fact it was one of the motivating factors
behind Tivoli comming out with their new Security Management application
because vendors required us to move away from our custom databases and
toward industry standards (Oracle, Sybase, Informix, DB2, DBMX, etc.) *AND*
at the same time requiring a better security mechanism than the existing one
we use (DES & Kerberos based).

The reality of the market does not support your thesis.

Are they involved with the new Cryptographic Standard projects of the
government and Tivoli - IBM? I don't think so, at least I still haven't seen
them involved in any of the work I have had access to so far; much to my own
personal disappointment.
