I always find these laws entertaining.  In Missouri, we have
state-run gambling in the lottery system, and state-licenced
gambling on the riverboat casinos.  Our Attorney General has
been very vocal about shutting down internet casinos, to
protect Missouri's citizens from being exploited.  His
concern for the welfare of problem gamblers in our state
is touching.  Odd that he isn't worried about those same
citizens being taken advantage of by the in-state
operations.

Of course, the real issue here isn't about protecting
citizens from themselves, or even about keeping citizens
from being cheated by the electronic equivalent of weighted
dice.  It's about protecting the financial interests of
those who now benefit from having local gambling monopolies.
The state gets quite a bit of money from the lottery, and
the companies that have invested in building riverboat
casinos here are surely concerned about potential
competition via the internet.  The cities that have
riverboat casinos typically get some part of the money made
from them, which nicely brings those city governments into
line.  Presumably, something similar is happening with
various states' Indian Reservations opening casinos.

It's an interesting side-point that really anonymous
communications and payment systems applied to gambling
systems mean not only that *governments* can't shut down
competing gambling schemes, but also that organized crime
can't shut them down, whether through influencing corrupt
governments to try to shut them down, or through direct
action.


Ob Crypto:  There are cryptographic gambling protocols that
can be verified (given some set of assumptions about
underlying operations) to be fair.  Thus, it's possible for
a gambling operation to make their client software freely
available in source, and allow people to see what it does
and review it for fairness.  If you find a reviewer or two
you trust, you can ask them to digitially sign the
executable they got when they compiled the code, and refuse
to use any other code.  This gives you a level of certainty
that you're not being cheated by weighted dice that you
simply can't get in physical casinos.  (Sure, government
agencies inspect those casinos, but the inspectors aren't
incorruptible, and they can't be everywhere at once.)

For a simple example, consider a situation where Alice and
Bob need to agree on a shared seed.  Assume they already
have established a secure (encrypted and authenticated)
session. They can easily generate a new shared seed by doing
something like this:

1. Alice generates random R_0 and sends hash(R_0) to Bob.
2. Bob generates random R_1 and sends hash(R_1) to Alice.
3. Alice sends R_0 to Bob.
4. Bob sends R_1 to Alice.
5. Alice and Bob each generate their shared seed, R_0 XOR R_1.

If the hash function doesn't leak information about its
inputs, and if it is collision-resistant, then this protocol
should work.  If either party generates a random number,
then the resulting seed is random, regardless of the other
party's input.  (You still have to work out administrative

issues, like what happens when communications fail
conveniently just after Alice sends Bob R_0, but these are
easy enough to solve.)
