When Attila says "I have this message from the list" and it has a
valid signature, it makes things considerably more interesting because
we don't have to trust Attila very much.  For instance, it may give
the owner of the signing key incontrovertible proof that his machine
was compromised.  If we have several examples of messages which are
slightly different from each other and are signed by the list key, we
know that an attack was mounted, although we may not know by whom.

I phrased that badly.  What I meant to say was that the person who
compromised the machine may be able to sign messages, but he or she
will still have to sign all the messages going out.  Which means that
they can be compared later, which may show incontrovertible proof that
Something Is Wrong And It Is Wrong In A Most Interesting Way.
