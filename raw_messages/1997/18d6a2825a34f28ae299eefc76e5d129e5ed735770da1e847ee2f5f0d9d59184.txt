This was part of the basis for my proposal for a crypto-dongel. Instant
destruction of ones private key any time any place. When the judge
requests your key and all legal challenges to the request have been
exausted you merly have your lawer give the judge the distroyed key. "what
your honor when was the key distroyed? well right after I saw a large
group of men in ski masks & M16's trying to kick in my door ...." :))

and patriots."
