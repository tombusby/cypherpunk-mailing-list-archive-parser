I agree, except I rely on this to sort the moderated and unmoderated lists into
separate folders.  I'm sure the bugs are still being worked out, but it would
be much easier to filter if the sender header was set appropriately.  Here's
the procmail recipe in case anyone's interested:

:0
* ^Sender: owner-cypherpunks@toad.com
{
	:0
	* -1^1 ^Received:
	* 4^1  ^Received:.*from majordom@localhost.*by toad.com
	* ^Message-Id:.*toad.com
	in.cpunks

	:0
	unedited
}

The number 4 should be changed depending on how many hops a message must make
to reach its destination.
