I can understand this sentiment, given the events of the past couple 
of months, but it seems short-sighted.  If this scheme grows there 
could be several hundred or more mailers involved, and there is no 
technical reason why moderated lists couldn't be included.

Remember that each list operator actually represents a community of 
users, users who are *free* to go elsewhere if they choose.  Clearly, 
some people would chose to populate a filtered list.  There is no 
reason whatsoever to discriminate against them.
