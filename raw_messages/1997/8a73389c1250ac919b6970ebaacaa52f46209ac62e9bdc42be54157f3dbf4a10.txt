Exactly. Bullies with any intelligence at all move into jobs that use their
psychological bent: politics, law enforcement, the military, etc.

And recall that this whole "Nuke D.C." thing is a misstatement of my
original statement. "Check the archives." What I said was that I would not
shed any tears to hear on CNN one fine morning that D.C. had gotten nuked.
And in other posts I haved opinined that D.C. is one of several "soft
targets" that are best avoided.
