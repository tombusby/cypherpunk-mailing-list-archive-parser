Pathetic, isn't it?

The important word in this sentence is "agreement".  If the American 
taxpayer does not agree with how his tax money is being used, does he not 
have the right to demand that it be used in an appropriate way?  If his 
demands go unanswered, does he not have the right to refuse to continue 
paying?  If the American taxpayer does not like substandard education, 
abortion, weapons manufacturing, destructive environmental legislation, and 
so forth, why should she be forced to pay for it?

The simple fact is that taxation in America has ceased to be an agreement, 
and has devolved into extortion with the threat of jail/forfeiture for 
"non-compliance".

If one were to break down the anti-Income Tax argument to its most basic 
level, it would be that the government does not have the right to extort 
money from its citizens to promote agendas which are destructive of the 
citizens' persons and property.  Basic Common Sense (TM).
