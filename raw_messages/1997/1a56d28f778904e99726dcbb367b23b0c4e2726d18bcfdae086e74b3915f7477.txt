A much more serious omission is that "longstanding" dates from about
10 years ago, when NJ Senator Frank Lautenberg, who made his money 
running ADP, a computer consulting company that rents out its employees
to businesses, got the law changed to force his competition to 
use employees rather than independent contractors, which was common.
A number of my friends who were independent contractors had to go
find consulting firms to be employed by, or go start their own shell firms
and spend a lot of money on extra paperwork and business taxes.
Many of those consulting firms, however, give their employees a lot of
latitude on salary vs. benefits, though taxes aren't optional :-)
