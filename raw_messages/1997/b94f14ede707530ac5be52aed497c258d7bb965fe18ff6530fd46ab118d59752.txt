A few weeks ago I made several references to the InterNet
being the 'new Gold Rush'. Now, I came across this on an 
anti-spam list.

  I hope that this is just a coincidence. I would hate to think
that I have personally instituted a new Battle Cry for the
Spammer/Enterprenurs. (I would also hate to gain the title of the
Benedict Arnold of the InterNet.)
