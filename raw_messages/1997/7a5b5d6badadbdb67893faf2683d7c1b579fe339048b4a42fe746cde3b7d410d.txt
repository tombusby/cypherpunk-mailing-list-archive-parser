It seems to me that the main impediment to doing this in the middle 1980's 
was the lack of inexpensive scanners.  But the utility of a system like this 
has, unfortunately (?) or perhaps fortunately, probably been killed by the 
Internet.  Today, a magazine or newspaper can merely post a short pointer to 
a website including an FTP, or something similar.  True, that doesn't 
guarantee the availability of the data years later, but...
