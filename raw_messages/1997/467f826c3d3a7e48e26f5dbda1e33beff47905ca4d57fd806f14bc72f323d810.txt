+You wrote some very interesting articles. It is the UN.

        if you want a real scare, read the UN "world constitution" on
    human rights and privacy --their idea of a Bill of Rights.  It just
    happens that it is virtually word for word equivalent to the 
    mainland Chinese "rights"  -in other words: rights as long as they 
    are consistent with the aims of the state (UN) and the security 
    needs of the state at the given moment.

        ...and the UN is to be granted overall sovereignity by virtue 
    of the right to unilateraly tax its 'member' states, and not 
    necessarily in an equitable fashion.

        to put it in context, it is clearly the havenots reducing 
    everyone to the status of havenot; there will be no others. this, 
    of course, will eventually give way to tribal governments and the 
    cycle will start over after the population is reduced by its own 
    pollution and starvation to a new balance with nature.  disease, 
    more than starvation, will be the biggest killer.  men will be too 
    hungry, and too sick, to fight until it stabilizes.

        there will be exceptions, of course, but they will lack 
    sufficient power to extend their sphere of influence before they 
    are overrun by the mass, or destroyed by chemical and germ warfare 
    in the last gasp. 

        the meaning of the 144,000 becomes more clear...

+Read Revelations (if you haven't). 
    
        have more than several textbooks on it, and have taught classes 
    on Revelation. 

        however, I strongly believe the interpretations are still 
    'every man for himself' --presuming, of course, the propounder has 
    at least the prerequisite grounding and understanding in the 
    fundamental concepts, starting with John the Revelator, who 
    never died, and why portions of the book are sealed. 

        the best general reference on symbology, at least of what I 
    have seen so far:

        Opening the Seven Seals
            (The Visions of John the Revelator)

        Richard D. Draper
        Desert Books, Salt Lake City
        ISBN 087579-547-1, SKU 2142298     
    

+Maybe put some scriptures on cypherpunks.

    casting pearls before swine?

+Happy Armageddon.

    Frances Ford Coppola wasted the good title: 'Apocolypse Now'
