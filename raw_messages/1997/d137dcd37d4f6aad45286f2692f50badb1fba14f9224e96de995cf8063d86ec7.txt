Sometimes it seems, as if the people advocating the
"business-reality" are furthest removed from it.

The "just don't work for them if 'ya don't like it"-argument  will
last about 4 weeks...the approximate time a human can survive
without eating. (or a couple of weeks less, if you have kids)

I.e. unless you are the super-duper, three-times nobel-prize-winner
(with lots of money in stocks), who can AFFORD to choose employers
that freely, you will be DAMN GLAD to have a job AT ALL, regardless
of their policies!
