Yet she's only as rich as the poorest of the poor,
Only as free as a padlocked prison door,
Only as strong as our love for this land,
Only as tall as we stand.

As we say in the Army, "Damn Skippy!"  While it makes me angry that 
governments commit some of the atrocities that the first 2 lines cause 
to spring to mind, It is the last 2 lines that define what makes a 
country great or small. 

Though referenced by it's government, a country is defined by it's 
people. For it is not it's government that makes a country, but it's 
people. The government is just a place to put the useless. :-)
