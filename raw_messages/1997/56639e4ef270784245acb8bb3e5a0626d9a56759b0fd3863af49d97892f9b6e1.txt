I'm not sure if what I did in the 80s, trying to create what I called
'paper ROM, is applicable.  In these investigations I used matricies of
small (1-3 mm) squares of gray (16 levels) or color (64 levels) with a mind
to replace diskettes for inexpensive mass data distribution.  I was able to
reliably get 100-200 KB/page side using standard offset printing.  With
modern ink-jet/laser printers you should be able to reliably get at least
10-50KB/page side. Although a technical success, I abandoned the effort
when I discovered someone had patented (4,488,679) something similar a few
years earlier.
