  Also, can one have one's citizenship revoked if they lose their
fingers in a bizarre chainsaw accident? Or if the "Circle of Eunuchs"
performs finger-castration on them because they are caught *fingering*
people while they sleep?

  Why are not alternative methods of identification used, such as 
placing a tattoo on their arms? Or remove the threat they pose to
others, by placing them in camps?

  Other, more crypto-relevant, concerns arise when one considers
whether this fingerprint-anonymity is perhaps a form of biological
cryptography.
  Is the person breaking any laws if their fingers leave the 
country? Can they be required to cut off one of their fingers
and send it to the government under fingerprint-crypto escrow laws?

  Perhaps we need a "Truth in Spokespersoning" law which would
require spokespersons to tell it like it is:
  "We regret to announce that we cannot allow this person to become
a citizen, because we consider citizens to be the property of the
state, and we need to be able to identify our property.
  "Of course, there may be other ways to mark the person for
identification by the state, but we are too stupid, anal-retentive
and uncaring to concern ourselves with looking into these areas.
  "Besides, we don't have to. We're the government and we can do
whatever silly, stupid, uncaring and unjust things we want to our 
citizens without suffering any consequences for our actions."
