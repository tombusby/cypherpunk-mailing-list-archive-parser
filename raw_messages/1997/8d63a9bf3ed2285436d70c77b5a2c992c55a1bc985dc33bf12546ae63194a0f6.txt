Don't do it.  Work for yourself.  You make four payments a year.

Incorporate and you don't even get a 1099.

Turbotax is hairless, painless and stupid proof. I know. I use it.

Consulting out is on the right track.  While you are waiting for the income
tax laws to change, _take advantage_ of what is lawfully available.  Crispin
wouldn't have a clue on this one.  Incorporate.  Any state.  It's cheap.
You can avoid some social security taxes for a system that won't be there in
few years anyway.  Remember when you could refile back a year or two if you
had a bad year (income averaging)?  A corporation can carry a loss back 15
years or *forward* , too, _and_ get a tax refund practically instantly.  It
is imho the levelest playing field available for the individual (wearing the
impenetrable corporate cloak (no shit, bulletproof), impenetrable even by
the irs) against taxation.  As for tax forms in April, use Turbotax.  You
don't have to know shit and it does complicated things for you like
depreciation.  Depreciate your car, your home office etc.  Own your assets
personally and lease them to your corporation.  Rents are free of social
security taxes.  Your car, your office etc.  With a little imagination you
may be able to make it fit your situation. If you're straight salary, _no_
other (reportable) income, you may be pretty much screwed but paying them
when you don't have to doesn't make much sense.

That's my point, use them when you can.
