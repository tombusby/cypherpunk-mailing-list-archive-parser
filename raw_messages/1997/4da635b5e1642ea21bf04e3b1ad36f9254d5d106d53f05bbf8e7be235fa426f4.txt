Good - let them exercise their ingenuity rather than forge cancels and
pull plugs.

OK, I see several approaches:

1. For some kinds of advertizing messages, like 900 numbers, even the kind
of exposure you describe is good exposure.

2. Alice's bot can state that it won't pay for articles that contain certain
kinds of "taboo" regexps - "fuck", "shit", "piss", "cunt", "spam", "Alice...".

3. When is the contract created, if at all? Alice can just review the traffic
by hand, as a human, and decide on her whim that she won't be paying this
particular Bob anymore.

Wonderful - go ahead and do it.  Anyone clueful enough to build a killfile
may not be worth advertisingto anyway.

Remember how Sandy Sandfart used to preach how he has the abllity to filter
out my traffic, but he wants to silence me in the interest of those who don't
have this capability?

Same thing with killfiles.

The address could be a black hole type of thing.

But, on the third thought :-), I don't like the idea of sending unsolicited
e-mail in response to Usenet articles, even if the e-mail contains e-cash.

How about this for a protocol:

Alice puts up the Web site listing the regexps she wants promoted.

Bob tells Alice (via a web form, say):

I will be posting as bob@foo.nospam.bar and bob@delete.me.foo.bar;
please e-mail my fee to bob@fo.bar; your decisions are final.

Alice e-mails bob@foo.bar, saying:
please post cookie1 to misc.test (or whatever) as bob@foo.nospam.bar;
please post cookie2 to misc.test as bob@delete.me.foo.bar
(to show that Bob does post from these accounts and does read e-mail
at bob@foo.bar).

Once Alice's bot sees the cookies, it starts generating fee e-mails.
Moreover if Alice sees Bob making fun of her, the way you described, she
can stop paying him forever.

There would hopefully be more than one Alice competing for the posting agents.
If she acts unethically (fails to come through with the payment), she will
lose reputation capital.

I mean, Alice can just put up a web page claiming that she'll pay for
promoting her regexps, and then not send anybody any ecash, cancels or
no cancels. Who's going to sue her for breach of contract and where?

Spammers are less crooks than Sandy Sandfart and Cocksucker John Gilmore,
or th scumbags who forge cancels.

I can generate a bazillion posters from dm.com, but this is rare.

I can also get a dozen AOL screen names from a single AOL account.

It's OK because the reasons for this cap are pure marketing:
(not trying to cap Alice's expense). For the target audience,
seeing the same 900 number >100 times from the same address loses
the marginal effectiveness.  If you post the same 900 number 100
times from ichudov@algebra.com and then 100 times from arabinovich@algera.com
it'll be as effective as if it came from irabinovich@analysis.com.
