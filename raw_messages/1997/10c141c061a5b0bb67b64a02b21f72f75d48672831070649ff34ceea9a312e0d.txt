  I have reason to believe that this post is not from Tim May, at all.
  My investigation into the matter suggests that it was written by a 
small man, around 4 feet tall, 85 pounds, with black hair, green eyes,
walks with a slight limp, has ketchup on his tie, and $3.24 in change
in his right pants pocket.
  If you check the headers of the message, you will find an anagram 
for, "Throw rocks at DC!"

  Does this sound like the Tim May that you all know?
