I made this point at the very begining. Source code is not even needed,
all one needs to know is the encryption & signature packet formats to be
able to pull the keyID's.

I already have this inplace as a Rexx script on my E-Mail client. :))

My set-up works with 2.6->5.0. It's just not persistent keys but the
ability to encrypt to multiple recipiants. Of cource even without these
features this functionality can implemented by moveing encryption to the
server. Only signing & decryption need to be on the client machines. 

It may even be more efficent in a corporate enviroment to do so. There are
performance questions in a high volumn enviroment but I have developed
techniques that greatly enhance the perfomance of PGP when working with
large keyrings. I know C2-Net has done work with their Stronghold product
for supporting hardware based encryption to improve performance on high
volumn servers, it would be intresting to see how well these cards would
lend themselves to PGP.

I will agree that 5.5 is an improvement but to be honest I am not that
crazy about it. Not that all of it is PGP's fault alot has to do with the
OS it runs on. NT just isn't ready for prime time. I have my own GUI I
designed for PGP on the OS/2 platform so I am a little biased in that
area. :)
