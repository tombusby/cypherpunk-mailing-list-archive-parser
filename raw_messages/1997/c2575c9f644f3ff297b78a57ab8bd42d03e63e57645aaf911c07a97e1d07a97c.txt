Not Helms, and not recently. From 'Extraordinary Pi',
http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~nickjh/Pi.htm :

     Indiana State Legislature House Bill No. 246, 1897, set the value of
     Pi to a to 3. Duh !

     Actually the wording of the bill is really unclear and can
     interpreted in various ways. Other interpretations include 3.2, 4
     and 9.2376. The bill goes on in a confused way to contradict
     other areas of elementary geometry, and to contradict itself. It
     got passed all the way up to Senate level, then a Mathematics
     Professor noticed it by chance, informed the Senate, and it was
     posponed indefinitely at its second reading.
