  This doesn't stop them from castigating those who post 
anonymously in regard to this subject.
  (As if not wanting to face 20 armed government agents who
consider you "armed and dangerous" {i.e. shoot first and ask
questions later} somehow negates their facts and logic.)

  So the end result might well be, not the assassination of those
involved, but the lessening of their power by virtue of depleting
their funds, which leads to a more equal playing field.

  Green Peace might serve as a good example of this.
  A sufficient number of individuals contributing small amounts
to the pool might not be able to negate the total funds available
to whaling companies, but they might be able to impact the profit
margin sufficiently that they would not be able to extinct the
species.

  But the results would be a far cry more interesting than
reruns of Gilligan's Island.
