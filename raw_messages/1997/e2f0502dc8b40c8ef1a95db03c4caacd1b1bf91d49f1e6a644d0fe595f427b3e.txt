A program, called Fortify, has been developed that hacks
Netscape to provide strong encryptioni.e. 168bit 3DES or
128bit RC4).
Available on most platforms and for both versions 3.0
and 4.0 of Netscape. Freely available on the site
below and only some 500K.

We have tested it on one of our pc's
...and it worked.
-> DES-CBC3-SHA connections with my own testserver have been made
-> Netscape: "high-grade encryption key for U.S. domestic use only"
