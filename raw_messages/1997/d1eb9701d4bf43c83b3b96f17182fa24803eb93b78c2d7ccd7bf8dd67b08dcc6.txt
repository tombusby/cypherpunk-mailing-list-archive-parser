This is a very strange forgery.  It appears that the attacker used
fcaglp.fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar as a relay.  This machine is running an old version
of HP sendmail that apparently accepts any hostname the user enters after
"helo".  I tried sending myself fakemail using this site but haven't got a
response yet.  The interesting thing is that the attacker used the hostname
echotech.com and not iquest.net.  echotech.com is a real domain so the attacker
might have been dumb enough to connect from echotech.com and enter the real
origin.  Or the SMTP server might just pretend it's fooled and put the real
hostname in the received header regardless of what's entered after the helo.
I'm not familiar with HP sendmail so I don't know whether this is true or not.
