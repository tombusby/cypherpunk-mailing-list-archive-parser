The perfect kind? (One wonders what sort of humans would be drawn
to such a job, and which humans will choose or be forced to pay
them?)

Ahh, the double-negatives of understatement.

How 'bout "tax-and-spend"? That's an assessment.

This kind of monitoring, were it actually possible to implement,
would mean the effective end of anonymity services. Thankfully,
it is presently merely a statist pipe dream.

Translation: "Shut as many of 'em down as possible."

Oh boy - "opportunities for prosecution," WHEEE!

Oh, but "we" can trust Craig Livingstone, Louis Freeh, Aldrich
Ames, and the rest of the spies, can't "we."

Why am I feeling so worried these days, anyway?
