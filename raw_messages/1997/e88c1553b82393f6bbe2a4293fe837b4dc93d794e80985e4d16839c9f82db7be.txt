There is another change to the way I distribute strong
cryptographic software at my ftp site (ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/).
The strong cryptographic software is still in a hidden directory
with a name that changes periodically, but access is via a
password protected web form at http://www.sni.net/~mpj/na/ that
has the current hidden directory name expanded in it. To get
your very own user name and password, please fill out the form
at http://www.sni.net/~mpj/getcrypt.htm, and then watch your
email box.

This change is to comply with the new Export Administration
Regulation (EAR) changes that require "checking the destination
machine's address" to ensure that it is in the USA or Canada to
avoid being accused of exporting without a license.  My many
friends outside of North America need not feel left out,
however, as I have a nice listing of some good crypto sites that
they can legally access at http://www.sni.net/~mpj/freecryp.htm,
which probably points to places with most, if not all, of the
cryptographic programs that are archived at my site.

Although the hoops are not so hard to navigate at crypto sites
outside of North America, I hope that a well-connected site in
Colorado will provide faster downloads for people in the USA and
Canada. This ftp site is rather busy, so if your connection is
refused, please try back at a time that is less busy.

If you have some high quality, strong cryptographic software or
libraries that you would like me to host, please let me know at
mpj@csn.net. Space is limited, but I have room for a few more
things, like programs to take on the RSA challenge contests,
etc.

Peace to you.
