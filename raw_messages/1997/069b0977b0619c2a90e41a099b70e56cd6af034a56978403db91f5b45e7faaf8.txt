SAFE is "All Americans deserve strong security and unlimited strength
crypto, but we still want your keys."

"Pro-CODE is about the right to have and export military-grade crypto, but
we still want your keys."

Or as Congressman J. Getalong put it, "SAFE is a step toward a future of
security and prosperity. The legitimate needs of law enforcement are being
met by this bill. We are good listeners of the NSA, and the NSA is a good
listener to all of us. And I do mean all of us. All Americans will prosper
from this new working relationship with Big Brother. War is Peace and
SAFEty is liberty,"
