Like what Kent, asking cops to defend you, from Cops?  Sorry, Kent,
that method doesn't work.  Filing a lawsuit, or bringing them to court
won't stop em from doing it again, also, a chance remains that they
won't get convicted, after all, almost any police force I've seen
always gets off for doing things.

Remember, plungering someone like that is definitely a cruel and
unusual punishment, and therefore a crime in itself.

Those pigs should rot in jail for violating someones constitutional
rights.

However, the eye for an eye thing would make for an interesting
punishment for the cops.
