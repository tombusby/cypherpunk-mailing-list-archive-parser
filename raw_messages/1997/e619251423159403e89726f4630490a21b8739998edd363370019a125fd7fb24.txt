I have known since I was a grasshopper that people trying to effect
change have a vested interest in making current reality look bad. 
People entrenched in the power structure, on the other hand, have a
vested interest in making current reality look good.  

This is an interesting competition for observers, bystanders, and
citizens.  If the power structure is flexible, and incorporates
changes that are viewed favorably by the citizens, then the power 
structure "wins".  But so do the citizens.

When change doesn't happen, or especially when it goes in a direction
undesired by the revolutionaries, but liked by the citizens, the
effort to make current reality look bad intensifies.  When change
irrevocably passes to an unwanted state, and the revolutionaries
"lose", a residue of Bitter Old Revolutionary Extremists (BOREs)
results.  These toothless old tigers, clinging to their youthful
dreams, rage at a reality that passed them by.  Snarling and
perpetually misunderstood, they wither and waste away, Cheshire cat
evil grimace postcripts to history.

I can't speak for Peter or Blanc.  I have no desire to nuke anyone.
