Tis better to let 10 guilty men go free than to imprison a single innocent
man.

The Red Cross is a non-profit organization that supplies support and aid to
both sides. PGP Inc. does not - you don't make tools that crack crypto.
Bad analogy.

Can't say that I am motivated by this particular meme. I am ecstatic that
the company I work for in my day job (Tivoli Inc.) is coming out with a
series of security and crypto related products to be implimented by our
customers on a global enterprise level. None of which support GAK or backdoors.
Now whether our parent company IBM will have the cajones to carry through on
it is another question entirely. Exactly how we are going to sell these
products over-seas does concern me, especialy since our product is used by
many large corporations for enterprise managment in other countries besides
Canada or the US and they regularly use our Courier product to distribute
data across national borders (not to mention some pretty big ponds).

There are at least 10-12 people at Tivoli tech-support who 'have got it'.

If those blade guards keep me from getting a close shave then they shouldn't
be there.

Exactly, it's the message that is protected NOT the media.

Congratulations and best wishes on your future.
