        It would be a good thing. 

        But the former was postulating civil rights to medical care and such. 

        I mentioned constitutional rights. Once they are here they here
they are entitled to a fair trial before being kicked out. And as to bail,
if they are illegally here, what is possibly the risk of flight? To Mexico?
Is not that the point? 

        That is why the INS gives them a trial date and releases them as
they must be treated as right-protected citizens. And the objection to
release is fleeing juristidiction under the law. It is a Catch-22. 

        Cheech being born in East LA to the contrary not withstanding. The
movie protested reality after it was gone. (If it was Chong, the facts do
not change.)
