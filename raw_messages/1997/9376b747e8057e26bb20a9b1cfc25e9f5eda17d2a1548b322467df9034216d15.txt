Aaron's denying that the cat is out of the bag?
He was fashionably dressed in a Lion Tamer's outfit,
waving a whip, and trying to herd hundreds of small furry mammals
to jump through a hoop and back into a clawed-up army duffel-bag!
"Cats?  Haven't seen any cats around here!  Pay no attention to these,umm,
Siberian Hamsters that I'm evaluating for export approval."

On this point, the other governments are correct.
It really _is_ tougher to maintain a nation-state when your
former subjects can have private conversations with each other
and with other governments' former subjects......
And even 56 bits is a start.
