Hi,

MTBF is usualy given as a single number, number_of_base_time_units from
initial turn-on to 1st failure given no power downs or other interruptions.

This is effectively of the form number_of_base_time_units/failure.

This is clearly equivalent to number_of_failures/base_time_unit for
practical use. Especialy considering that in this form you generaly don't
ever need to do a division as you do if you use the first form.
