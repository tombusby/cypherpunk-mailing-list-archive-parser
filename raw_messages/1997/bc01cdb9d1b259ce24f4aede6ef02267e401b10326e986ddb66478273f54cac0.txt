TM:
    Yes, you were spreading FUD, of a particularly stupid kind.

    I've always distributed my DES cracking software with full 
source code, as well as a compilied Wintel version. Anyone 
who wants to can examine the source and compile it independently 
if they worry about a mismatch between the source and the 
included binary. 

    Sven Mikkelsen (http://inet.uni-c.dk/~svolaf/des.htm) has 
now published full source for BrydDES was well. It runs faster 
than my code, but is only for x86 (mine includes generic 'C').

    If you want to participate in a coordinated attack, and don't
mind using a binary-only client, see. 
http://www.frii.com/~rcv/deschall.htm. This effort claims to have
already searched 15% of the keyspace.
