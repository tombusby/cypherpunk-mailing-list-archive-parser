Subject: U-Haul/Credit Cards/Social Security Numbers


Today I went to the local U-Haul to rent a small trailer to move a lawn
tractor. In the course of filling out the rental agreement I was asked for
my drivers license then asked for my social security number which I refused
to give. (Texas does not have SSN on the driver's license) The agent then
asked for a credit card, which I was planning to use to charge the rental.
During the subsequent discussion the agent told me that since the Oklahoma
bombing if they don't get a SSN they are required to to get a credit card
number as a second form of identification. They can then get the SSN from
the credit card issuer.

Questions: Is this for real?  How wide spread is this?  What does U-Haul do
with your SSN? How difficult is it for someone (company) to get your SSN
when you use your credit card?

                [ Under current law, your SSN is part of what's called
                  "credit header" data, and is (no longer) protected
                  under the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act).

                  This means that for all intents and purposes, your
                  SSN is public information.
