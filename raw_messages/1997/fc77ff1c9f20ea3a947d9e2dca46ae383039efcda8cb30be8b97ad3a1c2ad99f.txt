This is most certainly a democracy, it's called a representative democracy.
That we have a Constitution and a Bill of Rights is a measure of the
founding fathers wisdom but by no means are either required to have a
democracy, nor do either by definition eliminate a governmental form from
being a democracy.

That depends on how the founders define the democracy. The definition of a
democracy does NOT define the system put in place merely who has a say in
how it runs.

You're painting with way too broad a brush. Like most things simply being a
cat does not equate all cats to be the same. This also applies to
democracies, there is plenty of room to manuever when designing it.

Where? When? No government ever implimented by man has ever been a true
anything. Not democracy, communism, etc. They are all hybrids of one sort or
another.

For there to be a true democracy as you seem to define it we would require
every man, woman, and child to carry a vote and be required to vote on each
and every issue. No government in history has had this much prosperity or
homogoneity in the desires of the people.
