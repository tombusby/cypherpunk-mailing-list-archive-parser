One of Bruce's comments is that any algorithm picked today will
probably be around until 2040-50; if computer speeds double every year,
then the marginally useful strength by then will be about 110-120 bits.
While it's nice to have an expandable key structure that will let you
increase the strength by then, 128 bits is really still strong enough,
and a fixed-keylength algorithm that's still workable in triple-mode 
should work just fine.

Allowing triple opens the field a lot, and by the time you need >128-bit keys,
machines will be so blazingly fast that a 50% difference won't matter much;
you'll still be able to encrypt that 1Gbps 3D video in real time.

How fast do you really need, in seconds, for typical smart-card apps?
64 cycles at 1MHz is 16000 bytes/second; 128 cycles is 8000 bytes/second.
How fast are most smartcards?  1MHz?  2MHz?  500kHz?
The main uses I can see for 8-bit crypto processing are
- cheap, large-volume crypto for uncompressed voice (needs 8000 bytes/sec)
- adding crypto to digital phones ( ~800-1660 bytes/sec )
- money cards (if you're not using public-key, maybe you need 100 bytes,
	so 8000 bytes/sec is 1/80 sec transaction?)
- ATM machines (which typically have 4800-bits/sec data connections,
	== 600 bytes/sec, and often have 16-bit processors.  Even DES works.)

Which interestingly knocks out Blowfish (18 cycles), Khufu (20), and RC5 (23),
and the only things faster are SEAL and RC4 stream-only cyphers.
It's a tradeoff between forcing the development and testing of
cutting-edge speed, which may cost you in strength, vs. supporting a
bunch of existing algorithms we're starting to understand.
If it takes an extra 2 years to develop new algorithms,
you've doubled computer speed, so you could use the 17-32-cycle algorithms
you're rejecting today.....

If this is the ulterior motive for requiring faster-than-current algorithms,
I'm all for it (:-)  Triple-DES is boring, slow, and just fine for most
applications.
