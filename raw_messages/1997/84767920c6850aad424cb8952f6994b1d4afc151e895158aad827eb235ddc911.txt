I few months ago, around when the second edition of The Codebreakers 
came out, there was mention of a second edition of the Puzzle Palace. 
 Was that just a misguided rumor, or is there a second edition in the 
works?  I was planning on rereading it, but if a second edition is 
soon coming, I'll wait.
Thanks.
