Bill Gates is in trouble because he is a squishy liberal and didn't know how 
to handle the Feds.

If the AntiTrust boys had gone after a company headed by someone who was 
aware of the nature of government (TJ Rogers of Cypress Semi par example), he 
would have just litigated the matter for 15 years or so and then when the 
decision came down it would be irrelevant no matter what it was.  What is the 
significance of a legal decision involving 15-year-old software?  But Bill 
didn't do that.  He signed the Consent Decree.  He thought that if one pays 
the Danegeld the Dane will stop bothering you.  It doesn't work that way.  
You sign an AntiTrust consent decree and you have the Feds beating you over 
the head with it for years.  [Ask the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company 
which signed one in the 50's and almost ceased trading.]

Don't deal.  Litigate.  Much cheaper.
