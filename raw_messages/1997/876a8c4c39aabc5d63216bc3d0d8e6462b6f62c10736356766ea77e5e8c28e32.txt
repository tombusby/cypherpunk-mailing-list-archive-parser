Don`t cloud the issue: The simple fact is strong encryption can and will 
obstruct law enforcement agencies in their "fight" against terrorism, 
child pornography, drugs etc... good.

Once again, you fail to give adequate qualification to this statement, 
what forms of terrorism are you against: one mans terrorist is another 
mans freedom fighter. Were the French resistance during WWII terrorists? 
Would you then say their actions were wrong? As for child molestation, 
this is a clear cut case, most libertarians follow the basic rule that a 
crime has to be a direct act of agression, and infringe the rights of 
another person, therefore child molestation clearly comes into this 
category, distributing pictures of children being molested, raped, 
buggered, tortured and killed is clearly not a crime. Please clarify your 
position on this.

Above are two examples of why strong cryptography is a good thing, law 
enforcement should be routinely obstructed as often as possible.
