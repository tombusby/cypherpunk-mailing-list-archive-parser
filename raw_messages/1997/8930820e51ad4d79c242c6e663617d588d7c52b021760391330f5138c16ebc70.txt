I actually used this idea maybe ten adventures back in my current campaign,
although I got the idea myself and thought it was pretty original. Well,
that just goes to show...

The setup was a little different. A psionic noble (yes, I'm playing off the
Psionic Knights campaign) was persued during the psionic suppressions, and
encoded the whereabouts of his (psionic) noble's order's tresuary in
plasmid rings in his blood, leaving behind him a subtle clue for friendly
successors to pick up.

The player characters found his buried body, dug it up and analyzed what
was left of his deteriorated blood. The party's (NPC) doctor found the
following obviously artificial encoding as part of more 'natural' DNA:

I explained to the players that 'A' was for Adenine, 'C' for Cytocine, 'G'
for Guanine, and 'T' for Tymine (the for possible DNA bases) and let them
loose without any further help at all. They actually broke the code, and it
was very satisfying for both them and me.

Here's a little challenge for you all: Can any of you guys break the code?
