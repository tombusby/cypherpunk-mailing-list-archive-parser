(An interesting essay from an Australian was sent to me via an anonymous
remailer...at least he or she claimed to be Australian. As I can only
respond to him or her via the list, here's my reply.)

And let me assure you that I am not insulting all Australians. I call them
as I see them, whether it's Americans (the most common target of my
analyses), Germans, French, Swedes, etc.

"Pax Americana" is the name for this trend. America sits astride the world,
as the only remaining military superpower, and an economic superpower as
well.

I say this not to be jingoistic, but as an expression of reality. The
former Soviet Union is in disarray, and its submarines and ICBMs are
apparently rusting away and will soon be inoperable. This is, in a sense,
good news. The United States almost bankrupted itself in the 40-year Cold
War. And now, instead of turning swords into plowshares, cutting taxes, and
getting on with life, American sends its aircraft carriers to far-off
places, acts as the world's policeman, draws lines in the sand and dares
Saddam to cross them, threatens trade wars, and browbeats other nations.

(I'd gladly settle for a broken up USA, with five or six economic/political
regions, each too small to run around the world butting into the affairs of
distant nations. The coming chaos may succeed in doing this.)

One of the first things the invading U.S. forces did in Somalia was to
disarm the civilian population. (I am not making this up.) The farmers
protested that they would be left defenseless against the nomadic guerillas
and looters. Ah, but the benevolent U.S. decided, via consultations with
the U.N., that the key to peace lay in disarming those they could disarm.

As the U.S. found, those they were unable to disarm kicked their asses all
around Mogadishu. Dragging a chopper pilot around town was just the most
visible sign.

So the U.S. retreated. Is this portrayed as a defeat? Nope. The warmongers
talk about how America has "bounced back" from its loss in Viet Nam and has
not lost a war since. More reason to invade other nations.

Anyway, disarming the civilians is now U.S. policy. Not too surpising that
Clinton looks with favor on the recent disarmings in the U.K. and Australia
(and with newer restrictions in Canada, too).

Amen. And Australia should not be completely surprised if the U.S. offers
to send "peacekeeping troops" to your country to help with the disarmament.

The conspiracy theorists who talk about the New World Order and U.N. "Blue
Helmets" roaming U.S. streets have it only half right: the other side of
the New World Order is having U.S. troops, possibly under U.N. flags
(barf), patrolling conquered, er, liberated territories.

I don't want to see my fellow countrymen die in foreign wars, but it
wouldn't break my heart to see some Aussie sharpshooters taking out foreign
invaders. Should this event happen.

(Many of us are fighting the New World Order, and I don't personally think
there will be Americans sent in large numbers to quell large populations.
America likes picking on countries much smaller than itself.)

Good luck.
