Bombs Away
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)

    Internet fear-mongering is back in vogue inside
the White House. The Clinton administration escalated
its assault on the Net this week, warning that it
provides bomb-making recipes to anyone "with a modem"
and proposing a new law to restrict such information.

     In a 53-page report released on Tuesday, the
Department of Justice alleges that criminals are
trawling cyberspace for how-to kits on making
explosives. "ATF statistics reflect that, between 1985
and June 1996, the investigations of at least 30
bombings and four attempted bombings resulted in the
recovery of bomb-making literature that the suspects
had obtained from the Internet," the report says. "A
member of the DoJ committee accessed a single web site
on the World Wide Web and obtained the titles of 110
different bomb-making texts."
