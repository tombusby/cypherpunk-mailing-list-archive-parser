"To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States,
and with the Indian Tribes"

The Commerce Clause is the most abused section of the Constitution use to

You truly are no lover of freedom.

"If ye love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquility of servitude
greater than the animating contest for freedom, go home from us in peace.
We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand
that feeds you. May your chains set lightly upon you; and may posterity
forget that ye were our countrymen."
