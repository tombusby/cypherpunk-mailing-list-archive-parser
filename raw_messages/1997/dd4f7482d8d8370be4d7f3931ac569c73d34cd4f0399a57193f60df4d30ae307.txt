I don`t believe for one moment that, however well intentioned such a 
move would be, it would work. The most notorious net.cops who 
thoroughly deserve the (spit) after their name would take little 
notice of such a charter and take it upon themselved to "act in the 
best interests of the usenet community"

I think the only real soluion is to see alt.cypherpunks, or indeed 
any usenet group along those lines, as I see it: Something to fill a 
gap while we get a solid and reliable mailing list format working 
again. There are too many problems with the usenet approach and if 
certain list members have great leanings towards the usenet angle we 
can gate it just as mail.cypherpunks is a gated group now.

Any more news on the majordomo network Igor?
