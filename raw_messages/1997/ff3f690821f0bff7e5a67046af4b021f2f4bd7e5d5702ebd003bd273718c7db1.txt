It was on the list last month, and the person was serious and correct.
That is exactly why we must now kill all of usenet as it stands, for
a new heterosexual beginning.

Nothing in there about faggots or cunts, is there?

Again, MY definition of a "bigot" is the correct one which is
most understood by modern people.

A "bigot" is a racist, period.

You are a fool then.  Religion and sexism and groups all have nothing
to do with bigotry.  A bigot is a racist, period.  That is TODAY'S
correct definition of the term, and I am a lot more current than
Webster.  Any anybody who has a "religion" and "prays" is a fool.
The only god you will ever find is within yourself.

See, there you go again, attacking the person, instead of the
argument.  You lose points for that.  Sexism is GOOD and right and
justified.  I want a woman cutting my hair, and a man fixing my car,
and I demand the correct sex for ALL activities.

Look sonny, I am not out to win any points.  I have two Doctorates and
22 years of experience.   I speak with authority and only to those who
have the intelligence to understand.   I was a perfect 4.00 in
College, and am probably the most intelligent body-politic analyst in
the world.  Now let's face it:  Faggots are BAD news.  They are most
always censors!  And that is the truth you can never get around.

Hey boy, I am too strong to stop.  I have more people and, more money
and more connections than you could ever dream of.  We are here to
"rip new assholes" in the faggots who have ruined the net thus far,
and to take over and make this net heterosexual oriented.  Just wait
until you see me in person some day; you are in for a big suprise.

No, all censorship shall be eliminated from this Net and I will
fight to the death to achieve that.  The only way to stop us is to
kill all of us, and you can not do that.  I have 6 or 8 associates
that you are unaware of, and we plan to KILL the current system real
soon.

So you plan on censoring me?  Not likely sonny boy.  I have more
connections than you have fingers on your one hand.

That is a good idea.  Faggots are most always censors, and can not be
trusted with heterosexual people.

Because of the faggot.  They always try to censor the TRUTH!

Look sonny, we are out to KILL John Gilmore's control of this net, and
your listing of the -three- different lists manufactured by that
fucking queer should put the icing on the cake.

Again:

Most faggots are censorous, and therefore NO faggots should ever have
any control over any "censoring" acvtivities of this net.  Period.

We have come to the time when one's sex and sexual orientation
should be clearly stated on all e-mail and Usenet commo.  Everyone
should start providing the data, for the good of the community.

No one should be forced to communicate with a faggot.
