	A new security vulnerability uncovered in Microsoft
	Internet Explorer 4.0 will allegedly allow a malicious
	individual to write a line of HTML on a Web page that
	will execute native code on a user's machine. Such
	code could run, create, or delete a file - or do
	anything a user can do from sitting in front of his
	machine.

Uhm ... "Whops" ? Not that we needed an excuse not to run IE4 anyway, but
hopefully this will further deter the "large corporations", who according
to Microsoft wants to "run IE4 on all platforms" ...
