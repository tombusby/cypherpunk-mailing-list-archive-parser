I have attached a file that contains the sysadmin password for the
main computer at Visa's head office. In order to prevent the information
being abused, I have encrypted it with Pkzip so as not to have to fear
running afoul of vague and indeterminate crypto legislation.
  I am doing this in the hope that by showing my willingness to support
the government promotion of weak encryption I will thus be trusted with
even more highly sensitive information in the future.
  I also used a short and easily-guessed password to show my support
for government access to keys in the hope that it will lead to wider
recognition of my value as a team player in government projects.

  If I am ever in a position to be hired for a job that involves access
to the secret codes for launching nuclear missles, I hope that I can
count on letters of reference from cypherpunks list members declaring
my suitability for working in an area that requires one to show proper
fear of and submission to authority.
