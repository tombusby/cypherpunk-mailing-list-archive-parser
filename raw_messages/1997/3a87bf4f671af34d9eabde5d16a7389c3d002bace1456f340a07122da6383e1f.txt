(Contrary to rumors, I _do) have a live outside of the Net. I've been away
this weekend. I probably can't, or won't, respond to all of the comments
about my recent posts.)

Sorry. I misunderstood you to be speaking of the "fouling of one's own
nest" (or whatever the ebonics translation might be) riots of recent years.

You are correct that a kind of riot in cyberspace is possible. However, I
think the attacks (not riots) will not be oriented toward mayhem (no pun
intended) toward one's neighbors, but towards destablization of democracies
and military-industrial facilities.

In particular, various attacks against the national labs.

And technologies to make the "force of democracy" lose their teeth.

Subscribe to the Info-War news list for more, although they are
unfortunately biased toward the U.S. propaganda machine. (It was by some of
them that I was characterized as an "information terrorist," a label I view
as an honor.).

(Hint: I was quoted/interviewed in oppostion to the Pentagon's
"info-warriors" in a BBC television show called "The I-Bomb." My thesis,
not all of which was inclued in the BBC programme, was that strong crypto
would and should be used to destablilze U.S. efforts to dominate the New
World Order. If an I-bomb could destroy the Pentagon, Livermore, Los
Alamos, and so on, I would press the button tonight. The U.S. military
machine is vastly more powerful than it needs to be meet the threat of
invasion of our shores (hint: even Hitler and Tojo were not real threat to
U.S. shores) and whatever is needed should be done to destabilize and
sabotage the U.S. industrial war machine.)

The spread of anonymous remailer is already being used to break the back of
the U.S. war propaganda system. (Given that Lowell Wood's crimes are being
liberated and sent to non-U.S. sites for their use in defeating the war
machine).

Cypherpunks stand for making the United States just another bunch of
contiguous geographic regions.
