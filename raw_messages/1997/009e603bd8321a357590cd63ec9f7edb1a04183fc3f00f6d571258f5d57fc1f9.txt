This claim is demonstrably absurd.  There are roughly 26,000 murders a
year in the United States each year.  The number of contract killings
is probably a good deal less than 10% of this which leaves 2600.
Let's be generous to the Court and say 10% of these murders are
committed by people who read the book.  (This can probably be shown to
be entirely false by comparing suspected contract murder rates before
and after publication of the work.) If we treat the Court with extreme
charity we will say that each contract killer reading the book has
only killed one person.  Total: 260 killers read the book.

Presumably many more copies of the book were sold and will be sold.

The only conclusion that can be drawn is that most of the people
purchasing the book did so for reasons of morbid curiosity.  This
should not be very surprising.

It appears that the judges in this case allowed their eagerness to
punish Paladin get in the way of their duties, the law, and common
sense.  This decision should be overturned.  The judges should be
impeached.
