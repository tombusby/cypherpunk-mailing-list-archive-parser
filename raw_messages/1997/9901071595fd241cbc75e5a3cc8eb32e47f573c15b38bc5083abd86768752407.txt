Have you spent time in Anguila?  I have.  As a visitor its a very safe,
friendly, family-oriented society.  But as a resident the picture is
somewhat different due to a certain cliqish-ness and small-country
mentality (e.g., the exclusive arrangement of Cable & Wireless).  Don't get
me wrong I love the place.  It certainly a world apart from St. Martin/Sint
Maarten only 8 miles distant.

I'm sure this represents an interference in interstate commerce and won't
stand up in court.
