Good if all this is worked out in advance.  I'd like to add a couple
thoughts:

The freedom from temptation to interfere (censor, etc.) outweighs
the slowness.

The nature of the list (crypto) creates more paranoia than most
other lists, making the above even more important, with the
advantage being that there *should* be less noise than other forums
due to the technical nature of the discussion.

Thanks to the last couple of months, c-punks has now provided nearly
every example of what to look out for and plan for.
