Indeed. As this message (the one you are reading now), I have stated who I
am, but the included (quoted) text does not carry this information.

By the definition above, this message is kosher.

By the definition that even included or remailed text must have similar
identification of all text, then any mail message which includes quotes
without full attribution would be illegal. This is clearly an
unconstitutional infringement on speech.

And unenforceable. (In the sense that there aren't enough courts to handle
the load.)

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
