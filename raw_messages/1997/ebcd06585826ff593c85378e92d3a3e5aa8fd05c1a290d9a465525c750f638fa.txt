Apparently the folks at LPWA.COM are checking into the possibility
of encrypting all sessions between the user and the lpwa-http-proxy
(ala SSL) as to prevent line-eavesdropping.

At this point, they're just playing with the idea and are trying to
figure out exactly how to accomplish that. Maybe we could do some
brain-storming and support them with that project...
