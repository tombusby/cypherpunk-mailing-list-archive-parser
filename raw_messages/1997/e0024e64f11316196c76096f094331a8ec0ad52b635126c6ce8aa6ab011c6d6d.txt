I know most of you don't use Usenet anymore...

Nevertheless, I'd appreciate any help.

A "balance" between "privacy" and "public knowledge of who is saying what"???

Like the FBI wants a "balance" between the rights of people to use
cryptography and law enforcement concerns?

You are truly a nutcake.

Imminent death of the Internet, film at 11.

An MIT study has shown civility is *unnatural* among heavy email users.

Even Russ Allbery will through out a "bullshit" and more now and then,
or do you want to argue about what "civility" means?

What does civility mean to Usenet II Czars?

It means deleting off-topic posts (which they've done), because they
are "abusive".

#   I'm somewhat disillusioned because two of my favorite newsgroups seem
#   to be plagued by a similar problem -- an increase in off-topic chatter.
#    
#   This has gone to the point on one of the groups
#   where some people have actually adopted an OFF-TOPIC keyword and use it
#   in subject headers.
#    
#   In a very recent discussion where I pointed out that this went against
#                                                        ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^
#   the very foundation of Usenet and that off-topic threads were 100% noise,
#   ^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^^^
#   a user that has been posting less than a year and a half (from Netcom)
#   patiently explained to me how she felt the main appeal of the newsgroup
#   was its diverse nature and that she found the off-topic threads
#   "invigorating."
#    
#   So I guess my point is I wish there were some mechanism in place to
#   reinforce that newsgroups are focused discussion groups and not informal
#   chat rooms or coffee klatches.  People are not taking it to email the
#   way they tended to in the "good old days."
#    
#   I was just talking about this with someone in email.  She described an
#   incident that had happened on rec.arts.books.  Someone flamed (ironically
#   enough) Mike Godwin for posting off-topic.  She said Godwin's response
#           ^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^
#   was that rec.arts.books was not a place for talking about books per se,
#   but a place where 'bookish' people could get together and chat.
#   
#   That pretty much sums up the point I was trying to make.

What else? What have the U2 Czars controlling CAUCE also done?

Not allowed the admin of a one-way remailer who returned the required
token for posting to comp.org.cauce to post here; no explanation given
despite repeated requests.

That's not "civil", Max.
