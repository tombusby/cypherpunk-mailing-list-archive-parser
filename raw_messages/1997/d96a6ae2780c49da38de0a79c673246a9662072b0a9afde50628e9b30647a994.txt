My hat's off to the genius who perpetrated this hoax.  They got the
government lingo down so well that for a second I actually thought it
was real!

Note the total disregard for the law:
>>*    Distributing the  extremist Citizens Handbook to foster jury
>>     nullification.

Or this wonderful excerpt which confuses real terrorism
("Assassination Politics") with paper terrorism, just like reporters
and politicians do all the time:
>*    using the  Internet  to  promote  extremist  ideas  such  as
>     "Assassination Politics"  or predicting the date of death of
>     a law  enforcement officer  or government  official to win a

Or this section, which is clearly intended as a parody of the FBI.
(Brilliant!):
