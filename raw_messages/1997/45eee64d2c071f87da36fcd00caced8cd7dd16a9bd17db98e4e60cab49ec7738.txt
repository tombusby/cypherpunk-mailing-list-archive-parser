*** Fraudbusters seek fresh angles as cybercrime grows

Crimebusters must devise more ingenious ways of combating fraud and
will need new international policing powers to stem a rising tide of
high-tech economic crime, experts say. Delegates at an economic crime
conference in Cambridge, England, this week complained they lacked
the tools and power to take the fight to the organized criminals
whose only barrier was the speed of their modems. Culprits were hard
to pin down, said Rosalind Wright, head of Britain's Serious Fraud
Office. It was harder still to "swat the fly-by-nights," she said.
