   Ohio Man Given Five-Year Term in Internet Sex Case
   
   Reuters
   22-AUG-97
   
   
   CAMDEN, N.J. (Reuter) - An Ohio man was sentenced Friday to five years
   in a federal prison for using the Internet to induce a 12-year-old New
   Jersey girl to make sexually charged videos of herself and send them
   to him.
   
   Paul Brown Jr., 47, of Cleveland Heights, was arrested in February
   after the West Caldwell girl's parents discovered some Internet
   communications. Brown had posed as a teen-ager in responding to the
   girl's Internet request for an e-mail pal.
   
   A statement from the girl, now 14, was read in court. She accused
   Brown of ``emotional rape'' and said her life ``has been a disaster''
   since she learned the truth about him.
   
   Brown was convicted on morals and pornography charges. His crimes were
   considered federal offenses because of their interstate nature.
