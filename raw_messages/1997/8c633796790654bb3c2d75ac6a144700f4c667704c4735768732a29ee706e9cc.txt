WEIRDNUZ.492 (News of the Weird, July 11, 1997)
by Chuck Shepherd

* Brothers Geoffrey and Aaron Kuffner were arrested in New
Orleans in June and charged with terrorism as the ones who had
recently mailed or hand-delivered suspicious packages to local
government and news media offices.  The packages contained
innocuous items (which nonetheless were frightening enough that
two offices called for evacuations) and a four-page manifesto
vowing that "Violent Acts of Consciousness Have Only Begun." 
According to police, the men's goal was to call attention to public
ignorance of poetry and that among their demands was that all state
inaugural speeches be written in iambic pentameter. 

Cypherpunks Action Project #323a:
Post a message to the list in iambic pentameter. (That'll show 'em.)

Cypherpunks Action Project #323b:
Turn yourself into the police as a terrorist, for "Violent Acts of
Subconsiousness." Take your Dream Diary with you, as proof.

Cypherpunks Action Project #323c:
Write your violent dreams in iambic pentameter.
