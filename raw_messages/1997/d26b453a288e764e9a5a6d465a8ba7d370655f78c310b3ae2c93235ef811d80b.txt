It is my understanding that this is a setting to force 4.5 to encrypt all
messages to a specified key, which would be the corporate "message
recovery" key.  PGP 5.0 has a similar feature--a check box labeled "always
decrypt to default key" in the settings.  When this box is checked, the
default public key (usually one of yours) will always appear in the
recipient list when encrypting a message.  In 5.0, the default key is
visible in the recipient list, and it can easily be remived via drag and
drop.  I think that 4.5.x didn't show the key, and didn't allow the user to
remove it.
