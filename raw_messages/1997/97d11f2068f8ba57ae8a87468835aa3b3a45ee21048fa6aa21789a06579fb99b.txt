> RIGHTS & FREEDOMS AT RISK IN NEW RIVER, ARIZONA
> New River is a small, non-incorporated community 30 miles north
> of Phoenix, AZ.  On September 10, 1997, the BATF raided the
> property of Charles Byers, a former munitions manufacturer.
> On the property they found a shed containing chemicals that the
> BATF claims are highly unstable and shock sensitive. A list of
> the chemicals obtained via court records shows that most of the
> chemicals are used in the production of fireworks. The shed has
> been described by some as "a glorified high school chem. lab".
> Our community, as well as the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,
> are under an all out assault.  The BATF has invaded New River and
> plans to create an environmental hazard against our wishes and
> without legal permits.  On September 23, 1997, the BATF blew up
> two bunkers full of explosives.  The community was not notified.
> The resulting shock wave rattled houses as far as four miles away.
> Kids at New River Elementary school were bounced out of their chairs
> and  scared half out of their wits. The materials in the shed did
> not ignite.
> The BATF brought in heavy equipment to build a berm around the shed,
> then constructed a concrete wall on top of it.  The BATF claims that
> the heavy equipment did not set off the chemicals in the shed because
> they used equipment with "rubber tires."
> The BATF decided the only way to solve the problems of the unstable
> chemicals is to burn the shed using Thermite as an accelerant to
> incinerate the shed and its contents at temperatures between 3000
> and 5000 degrees. This would completely destroy any organic compounds
> that might exist.  The inorganic compounds would not be destroyed,
> but would instead, vaporize and form possible new and deadly airborne
> combinations. The EPA approved the BATF's plan, a federal judge
> issued an evacuation order, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, went
> along.  The burn was set for October 18, 1997.  The Sheriff, a thirty
> year veteran of the DEA, sent his posse to notify residents that they
> were to evacuate their property, including all domestic animals and
> birds.  Since this is a rural area, most people have more than just
> a cat or dog. Folks here raise horses, pigs, chickens and exotic
> birds and animals.  Many raise more than one species and have
> multiple head.
> At a community meeting with the BATF, EPA and Sheriff Arpaio,
> residents asked questions of the assembled panel.  The panel could
> not or would not respond to residents inquires:  "What exactly was
> in the shed and in what quantities?  What effect would burning the
> chemicals have on our soil, air and ground water, both short and
> long term?  Where were residents to take their animals?  Who was
> going to pay for any damages sustained to properties (Brush fired
> hazard is very high this time of the years)?"
> It was evident that the effects of the burn had not been determined.
>  The EPA representative said numerous times, "We will monitor before
> and after."  Sheriff Arpaio threatened to forcibly remove anyone who
> refused to leave their property.  He could not understand why
> residents did not want - or appreciate - his 'protection'.  He stated
> that it is within his power and responsibilities to protect us from
> ourselves. So many people refused to evacuate that the October 18
> burn was postponed until November 1, 1997.  Three hundred fifty homes
> were to be evacuated, for 12 to 24 hours, within a three mile radius
> of Byers' property.  The evacuation maps provided to us, prepared by
> the BATF, were completely wrong.  They have been redrawn - with the
> radius now only extending 1.5 miles so as not to inconvenience the
> people in the Manufacturer's Outlet Mall nearly three miles from the
> proposed burn site.    When asked, "If these chemicals are so
> sensitive, why did the BATF set off explosions near the shed?", they
> said it was a mistake.
> We have not accepted that the federal, or even local, government can
> force us to leave our homes, proceed with reckless behavior with
> detrimental effects on our land, lives and livelihoods, and not be
> accountable.  The BATF and Sheriff Arpaio have tried to make us feel
> like we are over-reacting and just need to get with the program.
> Sheriff Arpaio did not stop his threats of forcible removal - until
> he was contacted by the community's attorney.
> On October 25,1997, New River residents held a peaceful demonstration
> at the site of the proposed burn.  We walked two miles up and down
> steep hills and stood before the BATF with American flags.  We wanted
> to remind the BATF that this is still America and that we have the
> right to live peacefully on our property.  Our government cannot, on
> a whim, destroy what we have worked so hard to build.
> Certain sections of our government are testing American's resolve.
> They are looking to see where we draw the line.  In New River, we
> have drawn that line in the dirt we hold sacred.  We will not allow
> the burn and will not leave our homes.
> A talk show host in Phoenix called what's happening here "The New
> River Rebellion."  We do not want New River added to the list of
> American Tragedies that  includes Ruby Ridge and Waco.  Call your
> own congressman or senator.  Let them know that you know about New
> River.  If we let it happen here, where will it stop?
