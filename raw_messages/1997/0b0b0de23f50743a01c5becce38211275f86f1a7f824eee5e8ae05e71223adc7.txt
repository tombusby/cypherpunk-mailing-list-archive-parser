Why?  Why does Mr. Finkelstein need to play be Washington's "game"
rules?
I understand why you need to play by the rules.  As a Washington insider
you are between a rock and a hard place.  If you step outside the rules,
you loose your connections, your influince, and you livelyhood.  (No I
do
not consider being an insider to be bad.  I apreciate the flow of news
that
we might not otherwise get).

For those of us who are outside of the "game" (by choice or otherwise)
it does not make since to play.  Nobody in Washington listens to us (or
that is the way it seems).  To give up those fundamental liberties
simply
hurts us.  Insted we change the system by playing outside of the "game"
(such as writting strong crypto code and giving it away before
Washington
makes that illegal).
