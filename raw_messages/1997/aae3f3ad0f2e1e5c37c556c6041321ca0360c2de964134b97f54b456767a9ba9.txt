What a crock of shit!!

Europe has been in a perpetual state of war for the past 2,000 years where
countless tens of millions of people have been slaughtered. Chances are
very high that you will face an advisatory with a gun, the fact that he
collects a paycheck from a government wont make you any less dead from his
bullets.

You must be getting some good drugs over there to conjure up this fantasy
land where everyone loves one another and would never think of killing
someone because it sure as hell doesn't exist in Europe.
