That's not voulntary, as Tim stated.

Unless you believe that voluntary ratings in order to get listed in a search engine are wrong.

Some pre-teens are smarter than that, and may thwart the system.  Whose fault it it then if they see a page with porn on it?

Therefore, don't use yahoo.  Use one that doesn't promote censorship.

And I won't be shocked when the Supreme court strikes that down.  The problem can be solved, just let parents monitor their kids access.  If that happened, there would be no need for this censorware and rating crap.

Well, if they have that privacy, they often go to a site with images that some people consider obscene.  That's when the parents, unable to accept their mistake for not being responsible, blame the webpage's author.

Those parents probably are lazy in the first place.

You seem to favor the "Let's just do this to avoid hassle" thing that law enforcement and government types try to promote.  If we were to, "avoid the hassle" with webpage ratings, we might as well "avoid the hassle" of using PGP and such so that we don't anger the government anymore.

I'm not labeling my webpage, and no dickhead is going to tell me to.
