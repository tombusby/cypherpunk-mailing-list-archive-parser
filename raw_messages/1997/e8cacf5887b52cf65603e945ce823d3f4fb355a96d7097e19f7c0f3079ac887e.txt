No no no!! Much better to add another layer of bureaucracy to regulate the
*evil* Safeway perhaps even an outright ban!! We wouldn't mention the fact
that the Safeway store was able to fill a need that the local merchants
were either unwilling or unable to provide. We wont mention the fact the
the people of the community *chose* to shop at Safeway rather then the
local merchants. Dumb sheeple all were hoodwinked by the evil capitalist.
My GOD how did mankind survive this long without the Socialist & Big
brother to save us from ourselves???
