Yes but tracing a call to a pay phone is the equivalent to tracing an 
anonymous e-mail back to a remailer.  In fact, anonymous e-mail already 
contains information identifying the remailer it came from, so no additional
tracing effort is required.

Perhaps you're unaware that snail mail "remailers" existed long before their
e-mail counterparts came along.  (Perhaps they still do, I haven't checked.)
You'd address a letter, place a stamp on it, and place it inside another
envelope addressed to the remailer service along with whatever fee they
charged, in cash.  When they received it, they'd open the outer envelope,
place the inner envelope back in the mail, throw the outer envelope away,
and pocket their fee.

All the recipient saw was a postmark from a certain post office.  You'd know 
that SOMEBODY mailed the letter at that post office, or at least somewhere 
withing their collection area.  It wasn't necessarily the person who wrote the 
letter, though.  Let's say that you get a letter that's postmarked "Chicago, 
IL".  Upon further investigation, you determine that it was mailed from 
somewhere withing the boundaries of the post office branch which also serves 
O'Hare International Airport, which is the USA's busiest airport.  How does 
that solve your professed need to know who sent it?

You said earlier that you were concerned about *REPEATED* abuse.  If you
can do something to prevent a repetition after (or even before) receiving the 
first e-mail you consider abusive, then your problem is solved, is it not?

There aren't that many remailers around, and a request to one of them to
have your address blocked, with a further request that they pass it on to
their fellow remailer operators should do the trick. If someone is sending
you SPAM via a remailer, then you need to notify the remailer operator.  They
usually act very quickly to stop that from happening, since it wastes their
resources as well as yours.  By its very nature, spam is detectable in a
content-neutral and sender-neutral fashion.

That's the whole point of using remailers -- so that some country that wants
to be tyrranical can't hunt down someone in another country that does something
it considers "politically incorrect".  If something annoys you, then stop
reading it.  Killfile the author.  Killfile all remailers if you like.  Don't 
use dynamite (pun intended) to exterminate cockroaches.

You're welcome to TRY, but nothing says that the person has any duty to make
it easy for you.

None. The solution you suggest is what already exists.

There is.  And there are places that allow anonymous remailers to operate as
they currently do.  I have no problem with that.  Do you?

Have you even TRIED?  You seem to be inventing problems where none exist.
If you're not worried about yourself, how do you know that others appreciate
your worrying on their behalf?

Are you offering to donate the disk space?  If you can convince Hotmail and
other providers to do what you're suggesting, and provided they properly
inform all new and existing users of this new policy far enough in advance
to make other plans if they so desire, I would not object.

Just don't expect anyone with a need for more than superficial "anonymity"
to use such a service.  Indeed, they probably already don't, anyway.

"Too easy"?  How so?  Are you saying that protecting one's privacy should be
difficult?

You're also being redundant when you say "anonymous remailer that keeps no 
information to trace you with".  If they store the information you're 
suggesting, then you're quite obviously NOT anonymous, even if some users
mistakenly think they are.

And so if you convince the Australian government to ban truly anonymous
remailers, they may still exist in other countries to protect Aussies.  There
already are countries that have banned encryption and anonymous communication.
AFAIC, any regime that's that paranoid about anonymity is an "oppressive 
regime" as you've termed it.  To quote one of the USA's founders, 

  "When the government fears the people there is liberty. 
   When the people fear the government there is tyranny".

And if the remailer stored no information to tempt litigious individuals,
firms, and governments, then that problem would be solved altogether.  It's the same principle that stores
use when they leave their cash registers EMPTY and UNLOCKED at night.  A thief
will often cause more damage to the cash register breaking into it than the
amount of the money that it contains.  What you're suggesting is that the
person's privacy be violated BEFORE any law is broken, just in case he MIGHT
break a law later.

It's your choice.  Go visit the list of remailers currently in operation and
count how many there are.  If it's too much trouble for you to send a single
block request, CCed to a dozen or so addresses, then you probably don't have
a strong enough case to go to court, obtain a warrant or subpoena, either.
By the time you go through that process, you'll have invested far more time
and effort than sending an e-mail or two to prevent the problem.

If it's not serious enough for you to request that your e-mail address
be blocked, then why should the authorities think it's serious enough to
devote the resources to hunt down your harasser?

If the only purpose of anonymous e-mail is to break the law, then why
WOULDN'T you want to block it?  Do you have some reason you'd want to hear
from people you consider lawbreakers?

That's your choice.  The solution exists if you choose to use it.

So if somebody in Argentina decides to harrass someone in England, how would
what you're proposing solve that problem?

It's good to see that you're finally coming to that realization.  I'd just
like to keep it so.

All this to nail a public poster who's offended you?  The problem with an
idealistic approach like this is that the prohibitive expense of defending
against frivolous litigation tends to circumvent most of the safeguards
you're hypothesizing here.  If the remailer doesn't have the financial 
resources to match those of the attacker, whether it be the Church of 
Scientology trying to silence a dissident ex-member or the government of 
Iran trying to prosecute an anonymous poster for "blasphemy against Islam", 
what protects the anonymous poster's legitmate privacy concerns?

The point you're missing is that you're trying to bypass due process and
violate the privacy of every sender on the theory that he MIGHT eventually
do something illegal.  Unless the remailer had already violated the sender's
privacy by storing identifying information, then your hunt would stop right 
there.

The remailers have found from experience that it's easier to simply not store
unneeccessary identifying information on the sender in the first place, rather 
than spending money on needless litigation trying to keep it confidential 
later on.

How would your proposal be implemented?  Some international law requiring
remailers to start keeping logs of their users' e-mail?  By your own admission,
all it would take is one hold out who refused to host "Big Brother Inside" to
defeat your scheme.
