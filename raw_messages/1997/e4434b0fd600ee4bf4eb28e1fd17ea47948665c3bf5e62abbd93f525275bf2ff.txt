[I think the other exceprt was based on this one, from Charles IX of France in 1563]


Printing press registration may prove essential in making printing and literacy managable 
on an international basis. We are not the only country wrestling 
with the public safety implications of  printing presses. 
France, Israel and Russia recently imposed import and domestic 
use restrictions. Several Asian, South American and African 
countries have had similar restrictions in place for years. Others
may impose them as  printing presses proliferate.

For many overseas, as well as here, the logic of the need to 
balance business imperatives with public safety concerns argues 
for printing press registration. The European Union and other confederations 
are considering printing press registration-based infrastructures. The world's major 
standards bodies are designing future standards so that printing press registration 
can be accommodated.

International standards and protocols for printing press registration may prove 
essential to hand off national restrictions on  printing and literacy, to 
promote a broad export market for printing presses and to establish 
a infrastructure acceptable for general international 
use. This would accelerate the realization of the promise of information 
technology, and that would be in everyone's best interest.

Working in partnership, government and industry together need to 
lay the foundation necessary to sustain and strengthen information 
security for America. I wish to emphasize that the infrastructure for 
printing press registration will be built by industry as a commercial venture. 
This task is huge. Collaboration among many partners will be 
essential if we are to establish a PPRI that promotes the use of 
printing and literacy worldwide.
