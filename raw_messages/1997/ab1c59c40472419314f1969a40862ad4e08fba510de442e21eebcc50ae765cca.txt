     I unsubscribed from e$pam over the holidays, so this item may already
      have been on, but if not it might be of interest:

      As required by legislation passed last year (partly in response to the
      P-TRAK fiasco), the Fed is required to study whether institutions that
      are not subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act are making sensitive
      personal identifying information available to the public, whether such
      information creates undue potential for fraud and for risk of loss to
      banks, and whether legislation is needed to address the risk of fraud
      and loss.  The Fed has recently published a request for comments on
      these issues.  Comments are due by January 31.  The Fed release is at

      http://www.bog.frb.fed.us/boarddocs/press/BoardActs/1996/19961223



      Have a happy, prosperous and reputation-enhancing 1997.
