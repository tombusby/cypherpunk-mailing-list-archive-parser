	You're making an invalid assumption... namely that people who
stayed on the moderated list are neccessarily wanting it to be the
main list. This isn't the case with me, for instance. I'd also point
out that some of us - including me - were taking the time to take a
look at what happened with the moderated list. On the one hand, it
did result in a decrease in the trash messages... on the other hand,
it also drove away 1+ good posters (TCMay for one).
	As I've said before, I might wind up going with Sandy's (or
some other) filtered list. But changing the name (effectively, to
cypherpunks-unedited) was a bad idea.

	I can see how you might ignore objections from those who
did make the signal/noise get worse... but from those who didn't?
_I_ tried to help you by letting you & Sandy know when something
was going wrong.

	I (and others, I believe) are gratified by y'all's attempts
to help. I just think that you went about it the wrong way.

	Would you be willing to help in starting up a distributed
list? That would appear to solve at least some of the toad.com problems
(keeping it running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) with which I am
sympathetic.

	I'm willing to help the _libertarian_ crypto community, to the
limit allowed by my available resources (I'm a grad student). Organize?
I'm not so sure to what degree that's helping. Progressive? I'm not a
liberal. Slight but meaningful difference in terms.

	The public won't listen until 56-bit DES is broken; then,
they can be told that "somebody broke the cryptography used by
banks" and they might listen. In other words, what can be done
is supporting DES-breaking efforts (ideally, via the collection
of different possible keys and their indicators, as someone
had mentioned earlier - sorry, I'm a biologist, not a mathematician,
so I've forgotten the actual terms. It was something that would
essentially enable the near-instant breaking of _any_ DES code after
the competion of the project. My apologies if I've gotten mixed up
on this).
