That is true, but with the MIT setup, you have to certify that you are a US
citizen and that you won't export it. Also, there are lots of folks who have
trouble with the overseas downloads. I just plan on making it available for
those in the US that want an independent site with out all the rig an
mirole.  Besides, I guesss this is just my own way of showing MY government
who I worked for for 8 years that I won't take it anymore. This is my way of
firmly placing myself in the Pro-Encryption camp. That means that their
enemies are mine now. And if the government wants to be my enemy, then it is
their choice. I served 8 years in the Army protecting our interests. One of
them was our Consitution and our Bill of Rights. This is ALSO my my of
letting them know that I will not tolerate them walking all over those core
items anymore without a fight.
