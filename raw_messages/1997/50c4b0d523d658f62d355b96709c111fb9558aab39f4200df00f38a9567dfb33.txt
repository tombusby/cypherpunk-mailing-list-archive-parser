Apologies if this has been mentioned before, but I ran across a new (new to
me; it's dated 2/19/97) paper by Dorothy Denning re crypto and crypto
policy/legislation. Historically, her work has proven to precede/predict
policy shifts on the part of the US government.

The paper has little information which is new to a reader of cpunks; but I
did note one ominous paragraph referring to the role of "TTPs" in Europe:

>>>>
The European Commission has been preparing a proposal to establish a
European-wide 
network of Trusted Third Parties (ETS) that would be accredited to offer
services that support digital signatures, notarization, confidentiality, and
data integrity.
The trust centers, which would operate under the control of member nations,
would

                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>>>>
hold keys that would enable them to assist the owners of data with emergency
decryption or supply keys to their national authorities on production of a
legal 
<<<<
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>>>>
warrant. The proposal is expected to be adopted by the Commission, with
discussions provisionally scheduled in the Council of the European Union for
the first half of 1997 [22]
<<<<

Also see <http://www.seven77.demon.co.uk/krisis/>, which appears to be the
home page for a pilot project creating a software and political/corporate
infrastructure for Europe-wide GAK. Yow. 

Also of interest is her cite
<http://guru.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning/crypto/Trends.html#29> to John
Young's archived version of the 12/30/96 revision of the EARs instead of the
BXA's.

The paper itself is at
<http://guru.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning/crypto/Trends.html>; like it or
not, it may prove to be a useful insight into what's coming in 1997/1998.
