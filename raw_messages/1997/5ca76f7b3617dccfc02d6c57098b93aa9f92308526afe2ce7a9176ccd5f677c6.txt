Not at all - he just reaffirmed my conviction that the IRA is right.

That's an excellent suggestion!  Thank you very much, Paul.

I found their web site at http://www.irlnet.com/sinnfein.
They have a little electronic commerce page - if you have
ssh, you can order a cool Bobby Sands T-shirt and pay with
your Visa or MasterCard.

OK, I hereby pledge to snail-mail $1 cash to:

     Friends of Sinn F\'ein
     510 C St NE
     Washington, DC 20002

Every time Hallam-Baker posts to this mailing list.
I urge other list members to do likewise.
You will be supporting a just cause.
