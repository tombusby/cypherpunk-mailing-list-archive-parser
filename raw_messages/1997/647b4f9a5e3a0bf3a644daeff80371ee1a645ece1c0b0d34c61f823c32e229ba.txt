I've been meaning to ask this for a while...but why *don't* we just pull 
the plug, at least for just a few days?

Unsubscribe everyone from all the lists, wait a bit, and then send a 
message to all of the subscribers with full info on each of the lists 
(cp, cp-unedited,cp-flames) and see what happens when they resubscribe. 

I bet that most of the people who don't post and don't care one way or 
the other wouldn't bother to resubscribe, so we'd have a higher ratio of 
people who mind if the list is moderated vs. those who'd be happy either 
way.

If you need to know how to set up a mail filter or defend against 
emailbombs, send me a message with the words "get helpfile" (without the 
" marks) in the SUBJECT: header, *NOT THE BODY OF THE MESSAGE!*  I have 
several useful FAQs and documents available.
