see, the whole problem here is the same as usual.
people mixing up pot with "other" allegedly "soft drugs."
Pot must never be mixed up with anything.

See, you can not trust any of those fucking foreigh Countries.
Even Holland, which is supposed to be the home for pot, arrests
people for "offending content."

It has become apparent that the First Amendment which guarantees
Freedom Of Speech, must be applied world-wide, in order to protect
de-facto Universal Freedoms, which all come from Common Law.

I like the idea of attacking and eliminating their POP altogether.
He who interferes with Freedom Of Speech deserves to have their POP
eliminated.

soft drugs?  "drugs" is a bad word.  pot is not a "drug" by the common
connotation in society.  pot is a medicine and an herb.

"Freedom Of Speech" must become the Universal World Standard for the 
InterNet.  We have a long way to go.
