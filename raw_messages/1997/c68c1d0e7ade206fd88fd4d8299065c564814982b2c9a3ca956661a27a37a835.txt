You're the one trying a straw-man, I was simply asking a question based upon
several comments you have made both in this exchange and in others as well.
It had nothing to do with your original question but rather an attempt on my
part to expand the discussion to include the 14th which it must to be whole.

Or is your view that you are the only party who may bring other issues into
this discussion? Because, my personal opinion is that I don't need your
permission to include other issues in the argument as long as I feel they
are relevant and can justify them.

Not really as it clearly states in the first clauses where that authority
comes from and the 10th clearly puts limits on what expansions the courts
and legislature can do with the Constitution. The last clause also clearly
states that the constitutions and laws of any state are not superior (but
does not deny equality as granted in the 10th) to the laws and treaties of
the federal government. The last clause also provides even less reason for
the 14th.

Face it bud, you ain't got a foot to stand on.
