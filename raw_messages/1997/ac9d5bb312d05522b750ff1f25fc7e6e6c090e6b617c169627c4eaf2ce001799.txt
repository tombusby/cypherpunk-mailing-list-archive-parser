Here you risk the media controlling the vote even better.  First they push a
tearjerker proposal early in the year to swallow up all of the votes, then
they ask for special interest legislation to protect their respective
monopolies on grounds of ecology, (one paper means more trees, one TV
station means clearer communication, etc.)

This prompts people to vote with who they think will win as opposed to how
they feel.  In this case the media shows numerous charts showing a pending
landslide in thier favor.  What do you know, everyone voted in favor of the
media just to recycle votes.

Actually, our founding fathers thought that the people were morons, a
reasonable assumption since news carried so slowly and most people were more
worried about how to survive the winter than how to read.

Not being right, just agreeing with the concensus.  Remember that most of
the Germans eventually agreed with Hitler, that did not make them right.

By the way, the general populus is still mostly morons.  Even with a higher
literacy rate.  Most of them seem to use it to read the National Enquirer
and Hollywood based publications.
