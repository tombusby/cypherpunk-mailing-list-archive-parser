Online Gambling Exec Praises Shutdown of Gaming Site

   The chairman of an online gambling industry ethics panel praised the
   effort of the Maryland attorney general to close down a gambling Web
   site as an early move to regulate the fledgling online casino
   industry.
   
   Attorney General J. Joseph Curran issued a cease-and-desist order
   against RealTIME Prizes Network for running Prizes.com, a site that
   offers a variety of pay-for-play sweepstakes through customers' credit
   cards or through CyberCash.
   
   Online gambling can be done legally and legitimately, but only by
   working with government regulators, said Kendell Lang, chairman of an
   Interactive Services Association panel devising ethics for online
   casino operators and CEO of CasinoWorld Holdings. RealTIME has "flown
   in the face of regulators and gives the industry a bad name," Lang
   said. "We want to support the attorneys general of each and every
   state to get control of the situation."
   
   Curran targeted RealTIME because its operations are in Silver Spring,
   Md., a spokesman said. The attorney general could take additional
   action if RealTIME were to move to another state and accept business
   from Maryland residents, he added.
   
   Despite the desist order, Prizes.com was still operational yesterday.
   RealTIME was not immediately available for comment.
