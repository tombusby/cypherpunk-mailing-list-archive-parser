  Are you part of a cypherpunks list conspiracy to balance my 
cynicism? Are you actually suggesting that there may be a spark
of hope for mankind to prevail in the battle with the forces of
mindless robotic sheepnocity?

  You seem to be one of the eternal optimists who can even see
the possible good in AP.
  I suggested in a recent post that perhaps Green Peace could use
the AP system to drain the profit margins of whalers without 
actually causing their death. Of course, I was low on Scotch at
the time, so my idea cannot be taken seriously.
