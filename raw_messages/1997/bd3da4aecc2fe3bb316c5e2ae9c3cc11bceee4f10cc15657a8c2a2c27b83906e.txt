Well this is exactly why the Founding Fathers set up the form of government
that they did rather than going with a "pure" democracy. The intent was to
insolate the governing process from the lynch mob mentality. This is
doublely so with the Bill of Rights and the Amendment process. They are
there to provide a break on the "mob" and give time to reflect on the long
term consequences of perprosed actions.

Unfortunatly all 3 branches of government have desided that they nolonger
need to abide by the laws spelled out in the Constitution solong as it
politically expediant.
