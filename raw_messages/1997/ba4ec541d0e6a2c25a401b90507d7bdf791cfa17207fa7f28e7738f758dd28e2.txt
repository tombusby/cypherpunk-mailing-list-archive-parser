 Uhhhh ... 03 Springfield is a bolt action ....

 Rem Mod 8 is Browning semi-auto action essentially recoil operated
with the barrel inside a sleeve surrounded by a spring whihc recoiled
back with the bolt as well. The barrel spring had a stiffer constant
than the bolt spring so it strated forward frist effecting the
separation of bolt and reciever and stripping the round out straight
up. It was designed in 1903 and first manufactured in 1905. It was, as
I said, the first semi-auto marketed to the *civilian* market. There
were other semi-auto's but were all military weapons.
