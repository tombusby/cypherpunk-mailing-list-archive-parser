Where have you folks been the last couple of years? Given that the list has
been discussing the Bernstein case (and 30 of us even attended some of
Judge Patel's hearings in SF), and the Junger and Karn cases have been
extensively reported, and the CDA was overturned, I'd certainly say court
battles have been a priority for a long time.

In fact, the EFF has more or less officially de-emphasized legislative work
in favor of spending more time and money on court cases. The EFF was, of
course, deeply involved in the Bernstein case.

I'm not sure what Detweiler's point was, as I only saw his comment through
Blanc's quotes, but if he was calling for more of a legal focus, I think
this was realized by many a few years ago.

Certainly I don't know of any Cypherpunks pushing for legislative
solutions. Most of us have explicitly condemned the legislative actions,
realzing that Congress can only make things worse.
