Don't you (or someone you conspire with) actually like have to communicate or 
be in the presence of a federal officer for that federal officer to be 
interfered with?  I don't remember any direct interference from the 
paperwork.

Sounds dangerous.  How did he use them?

Another one of those face saving plea bargains that the Feds accept when they 
know they've bit the big one.

What was the biggest charge reduction in the history of plea bargaining?  
That would have been the reduction from a charge of Sodomy to a charge of 
Following Too Close. -- From the International Committee for the Preservation

So where are these "others" and why are they still being allowed to walk the 
streets?  Last time I looked, it was legal to devise a plan to overthrow the 
government.

They always prey on the weak or sick.

All right.  You forced me.  "Why do they call it the 'Reasonable Man Test'?
