This is an interesting development because it also makes it hard for
the Iraqi government to track what is going on, too.  The government
of Iraq has been aware of the dangers of computers for many years.  At
one time they were tightly controlled.  Even typewriters were
controlled.  The government had writing samples of each one.

Now, apparently, this policy is loosening.  This suggests that U.S.
policy of the last 8 years has managed to achieve what Saddam Hussein
could not - it has made the Hussein regime a genuinely popular
government.

Still, it can't be universally popular.  How many cypherpunks live in
Iraq?
