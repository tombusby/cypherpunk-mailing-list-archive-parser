7. How about the hit sqaud (from BATF, DEA, Border Patrol, Forest 
Service, etc [I'm not kidding]) who killed Donald Scott in Orange 
County because they wanted his primo land surround by national 
forest.  Crufted some excuse about pot on his land.  No pot, but
when they forcibly entered early in the morning and accosted his
wife, they shot him when he tried to protect her.  The local DA said
they lost their "moral compass".

 8. The military guys who killed the shepard in Texas.

9.  The police chief currently Wacoizing an elderly woman cuz
she refused to be hauled off (for psychiatric treatment) and 
sacrifice her land to the hungry wolves waiting to sell it off.

10. The wonderful people who organize the presidential debates
which denied the libertarian cadidate (on the ballot in all 50, 
before Perot) participation in the debates.  When libertarians 
peaceably assembled at the debate site they were cordoned off by SS 
in black ninja suits, MP5 submachine guns and german shepards.  Local 
police then descended on one of the libertarians taking pictures and 
beat him senseless, saying "we know what your up to!".  I guess he 
was trying to excercise his right to disagree with fascism.  
(personally witnessed this one and got it on hi-q video).  Little to 
no news coverage.

11. Any number of participants at Waco.

12. We could just go on and on....

Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?  Let
