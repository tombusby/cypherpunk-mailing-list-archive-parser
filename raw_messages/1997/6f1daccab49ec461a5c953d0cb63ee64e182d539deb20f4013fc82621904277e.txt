  I consider this issue so important that I thought it appropriate
to reply to it even before it arrived at the Cypherpunks mailing
list.
  I believe that people should be required by law to provide not
only their true identity when using the Internet for communications,
but should also be required to provide their true physical location,
so that law enforcement agencies will know whether what they are
writing is legal or illegal in the state from which they are 
sending the communication.
