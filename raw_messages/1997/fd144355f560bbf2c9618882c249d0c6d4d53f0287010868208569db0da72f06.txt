I would like to remind George Spelvin (if that is your  *real* name)
that is improper Netiquette to reply to your own anonymous posts
before they have even arrived to the mailing list to which they were
sent.
While the Mandatory/Voluntary Netiquette rules are unclear in regard
to those with psychic abilities responding to the posts of others
before they arrive at the mailing list, I am certain that the concept
is the same.

  This is patently ridiculous!
  How do you know for certain that 'Anonymous' is not the person's
*real* name? And how do we know that Anonymous is not physically
*at* REPLAY.COM? Point to it on a map for me, why don't you?
  For that matter, how do we know that George Spelvin is *your*
real name? And how do we know if you are physically at dev.null?
  I think that others on the list will agree with me that your logic
is lame, and your arguments are ridiculous.
