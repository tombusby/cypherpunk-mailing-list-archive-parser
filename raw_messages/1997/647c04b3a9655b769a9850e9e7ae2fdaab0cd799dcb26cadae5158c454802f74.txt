The only "nice people" are dangerous anarchists bent on destroying 
governments and buggering poloticians to death. (last part a personal 
preference of course, the author is totally straight but would 
nonetheless be distinctly amused to see any government official 
butt-raped to death)

How very benevolent. Its nice to know that instead of censoring your 
pages they send in the jackbooted thugs to do it for them, then throw you 
in a nice 6x9 cell for the henious crime of displaying some .gifs or similar.

And if he chooses not to remove the content you happen to find offensive?
If you truly believed in the rights of the author and publisher of the 
information you would think about it before sending in your own 
particular brand of thugs to "crush the mutiny".

Sometimes one really wonders why we bother to set up mirrors to allow 
freedom of information to users, when the owners of these servers, 
supposedly in favour of free speech, do not even have the strength of 
character or conviction to decide for themselves what they will allow on 
their servers rather than bending over for the long cock of the law...

As far as I can see it hasn`t even started yet.

I presume B-92 fell into line and matched the "requirements under law for 
obtaining a free-speech permit" before XS4ALL allowed this/

And anyone who guarantees to publicly lick the boots of the benevolent 
owners in thanks for their support gets as much free space as they like?

Of course I believe in the right to free expression of anyone and if 
these thugs choose not to allow material they don`t like on their servers 
they have every right to remove it. I just don`t see that setting up 
mirrors to defeat blocks on sites that refuse to carry certain content is 
of any value in the fight for free speech. Sure, create a mirror of 
Radikal, but giving any credit or attribution to XS4ALL seems to be a 
poor choice.
