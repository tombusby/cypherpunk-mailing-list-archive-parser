If the marketing-droid didn't have the ability to answer such a basic
question, DEC should have just sent out videotape promos.  I don't
understand why they went through the expense of sending warm bodies
out on a roadshow without giving them enough specification about
the product to give an effective presentation to a predominantly
tech-oriented audience.  From whom did they expect the questions to
come?  A competent marketing professional would AT LEAST know what
standards/protocols the product supported, does a car company send
its sales force out without knowing if the cars use gas or diesel?

Another example of how the Macro$loth mindset of tossing out random
buzzwords to a chorus of ooooh's and ahhhh's has polluted the 
industry.  

In Rick's case, DEC's image was deflated.  OK, so how many other
people present got the same impression.  And it's very likely that
one of those people is a decision maker, or the anecdote got back
to one of the decision makers.  So, due to DEC's failure to ensure
that their sales force new the product, they can probably scratch 
Grumman off of their potential client list.
