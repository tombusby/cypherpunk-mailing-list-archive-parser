Now this is truly helpful advice to get what's being miscommunicated
by deranged brute-forcers spit and shined and pinstripped like 
truetext masterblasters.

If some dingdong's spew comes through translation unchanged then 
it is the plain vanilla-est, the most unshaded, unnuanced, unbiased, 
untrickery, unimaginative, and thus the most omnipotent of all possible 
upchuckery aimed to infect the globe with toenail jam passing as troot
juice.

If these lies (aka blackheart pus-drip) remain unchanged by translation 
and unmangled by retranslation through all spitbucket languages and 
all Earth's cheese-bowels bent on misconstruance and prejudicial 
warp to fit preconceptions of perfectly slit-minded right to disembowel
and deny life and liberty to those of opposing views, then it is the word 
of You Know Who, and your way-behind clan better believe it, and 
copy it, and bray-pray in it and bet your bed-watering, unwavering 
Clone Constitution Bible Koran Hit Man Browser on it. 

Seattle-shrouded in this Kelvar-asbestos cloak, napalm those east of
the Rockies (and west) who question the Macrosoft Word, PR sizzle 
those who mock it, and Jesus-crowbar the infidels who mess with 
mismarketing PICS to the world's DoJs and 1st Amend lingo 
freedom-futzing bill-mauling mud-doggies.

Sez Iggy, plain and simple.
