Anonymous cellular accounts have been available in NYC for a year or so.  See any copy of the Post or the Daily News for the ads.  A similar service just started in Mexico City according to the NYT.  

You call the company and order the phone for circa $249.00 C.O.D.  This includes one hour of calls.  Subsequent hours are purchased for $36.  Not cheap but anonymous.  No roaming either.
