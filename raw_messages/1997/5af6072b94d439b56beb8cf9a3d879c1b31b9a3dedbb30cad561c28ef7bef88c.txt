Neither did I.  But the question at hand is whether the IETF OpenPGP
should recognize them.

I'd argue that it's more than just not necessary, having the
information in the public key is the sole reason I'm arguing that this
is a GAK compliant feature.

Not very intuitive to the user though is it.  Also not a very strongly
optional feature if 80% of businesses end up bouncing your mail back
at you because you're "choosing" not to be GAK compliant.

Not so fast there.  That isn't the stated problem.  The problem is
that not only can some 3rd party adopt it (no modifications necessary,
that's why I'm dubing it "GAK compliant"), but that the rest of the
compliant OpenPGP standards would automatically cooperate to some
degree, and we would thereby be streamlining the migration path to
mandatory GAK.  If PGP retract the GAK compliancy feature, by removing
the functionality in the key, we won't be calling it GAK compliant.
They (and any other government or corporate message snooping feature
implementors) can achieve message snooping without adding this
functionality to the OpenPGP standard.

No, they are not.  I've argued in reply to your other post why this is
clearly not so.  The difference is that PGP is creating a new animal:
a key which it is defined will be auto-encrypted to two keys by the
_sender_.  Variations being discussed being auto-encrypt with user
query, or auto-encrypt with user override to disable.  Regardless, the
fact that PGP is encouraging the process of enforcing this dubious
security practice via their policy enforcer means that users are
forced to use the GAK compliancy feature to get through to any
corporates who are using PGP's method of implementing corporate
message snooping.

It's less strongly enforced GAK compliance, but I think it is still
a form of GAK compliance.

To see why this might be, consider the effects of 80% of the business
community using this feature, and you as a pro-privacy cypherpunk type
(you are pro-privacy aren't you?).  Consider also that government has
mandated that companies hand over their message snooping master key to
the Feds.

Now what happens.  In the above, you have the "option" not to use the
GAK compliance feature in that you can still send a message, but the
option won't be worth much in that the recipient will be unable to
read it.  If lots of people are using this system, that will cut you
off.  You will be unable to send email to these people.  It's all very
well to say you have the "choice" not to do business with them, but
your choices may be severely restricted.

I hope that following from this discussion you can see the advantages
of PGP switching to the use of the normal multiple crypto recipient
field to acheive this message snooping functionality.  It doesn't
apply at all to the recipient.  The snooping of received email for
those using PGP 5.6 "message snooping for businesses" is done after
decryption in the PGP5.6 "for message snooping enforcing" client.  The
snooping of sent mail for users of PGP5.6 "for message snooping
enforcement" client is done inside the corporate LAN as the message
snooping packet security leak prevention functionality built in to the
PGP 5.6 "SMTP prevention of security leaks enforcer" strips out the
second message snooping crypto recipient packet.

You may have not been convinced of the case, but that is because you
have not considered the long term picture, interoperability issues,
and utility to GAKkers of having GAK compliant features in the IETF
OpenPGP standard.

The argument that pgp5.5 has mandatory GAK compliancy does not in any
way apply to older versions of PGP.

PGP 2.x can support voluntary GAK in that the user can send to a
second key that the NSA generates for thme.

It is the features which move the enforcement of this functionality
into the senders client, and the fact that the "optional" nature
becomes weakly optional (meaninglessly optional) if you consider
scenarios where most businesses are using the pgp5.5 SMTP policy
enforcer to bounce your email unless it complies, and where business
are legally required to use such policy enforcers, and businesses are
legally required to hand over the master corporate snooping key to the
GAKkers to go in the NSA database.

That's a separate argument entirely.  I believe that I have shown
security advantages in not doing corporate message snooping in the way
that PGP is "proposing" (by steaming ahead and implementing and
deploying it outside of the IETF OpenPGP process).  In addition I made
the point earlier that any form of message snooping is weak... there
are many ways for the determined employee to by pass it.  The only
real protection is surveillance cameras, tamper-resistant key board
logs, and body cavity searches at the door.  So if enforcement is weak
anyway, it seems sensible to trade some small percentage of this
enforceability for enhanced security.

I went to great pains to detail other more secure, and entirely
feasible methods of assuring corporate message snooping functionality
can be built.

I also clearly distinguised between stored documents and documents in
transit in transient communications mediums.

In addition I argued for key escrow of storage keys as good company
backup policy.

You have not been paying attention here, or are playing the function
of the luddite, refusing to accept that better security is obtained by
separating the functionality of encryption keys and storage keys.

A similar example might be if you were to refuse to countenance the
suggestion that having separate signature and encryption keys is
better than not doing using as an argument perhaps the fact that
pgp2.x has been using the same key for both purposes for years.

The point of the IETF OpenPGP standardisation process is to explore
the options and decide on the best technical approach, which is in the
interests of the Internet community.
