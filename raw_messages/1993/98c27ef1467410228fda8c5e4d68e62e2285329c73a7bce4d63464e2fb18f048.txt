Haven't you people ever heard of mail receiving services and voice mail?  
When people want to violate your privacy by asking questions, give them 
what they want but make sure it's meaningless.  When people ask *me* 
address and phone number as they seem to do every week or so, I just give 
them my voice mail and mail drop.  ($20/month combined cost NYC.)

No laws required.
