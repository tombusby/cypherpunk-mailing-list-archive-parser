I've created a digest list for error reporting.  The digest list
is errors-d@extropia.wimsey.com.  Send a message to errors-d-request
to subscribe.  Following this is an example of a digest.  Notice
that the subjects (which include the ID of the messages in question)
are the the top for quick browsing.  Currently, the digest is
transmitted every 12 hours.

I'm also handling bounces now, not only remail errors.
