Making it adaptable is what I mean by "cleaning it up a bit." ;^)

Telix is "user supported software."  Registering it costs $39.

I remember kermit's script language as being kinda messy...  At the end of this
message, I will include a portion of my, uncommented, script to compare.  Also,
kermit is (I think) restricted to one xfer protocol, which may not be a good
idea.

Well, either way, I will contribute my user-interface if you'all want it.  I'm
not married to telix, but I do think it is very good.  We could write comparable
scripts in every major comm program script language.... I'd have to document
my interface.  But if I decide to port my interface to C, I'd like to change 
a few things, so maybe this is a bit premature.....

I don't understand this last comment.  Maybe it's obvious and I'm just tired...
Part of my script system is after my signature.  Note that I hacked in a C
preprocesser, and this is the output from it, just before the script is compiled
Yes, Telix scripts are compiled! ;^)
