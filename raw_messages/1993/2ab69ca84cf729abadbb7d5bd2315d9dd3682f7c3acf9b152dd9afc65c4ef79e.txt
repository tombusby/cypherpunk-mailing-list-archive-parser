While I'm not intimately familiar with the workings of the NSA, I would
guess that folks w/ Ph.D.'s and no/little work experience are probably
brought in near the top end of that range, though the advanced degree would
allow for quicker advancement to senior technical or management positions
and correspondingly greater pay.  Also, be sure to include the labor
surplus, government benefits and job satisfaction as factors in considering
salary adequacy.

MITRE pays me significantly less than what they would pay a Senior VP,
which is about the level where I would feel comfortable stating that I
"speak for" MITRE.  As for the team-building observations I made above,
they are made from a general management perspective and are open to debate,
though that discussion might be a bit off-topic for cypherpunks if removed
from the crypto framework.
