You know Mr. Detweiler, I've been trying real hard to stay out of this one,
for three reasons:

        A: I think you've made positive contributions to the list.
        B: Here on cypherpunks we try NOT to argue ideologies, (but this
breaks down, unfortunately, when a person such as yourself tries to impose
his own ideology on the rest of us).
        C: Your style often makes it difficult for me to think rationally
for some time after reading them, and I hate writing irrational letters.

But I absolutely must request that you clarify this quote:

>most of all, do not pollute the Constitution with your lies:
>
>>The freedom to communicate in any way whatsoever, including
>>"pseudospoofing", is a Constitutional guarantee and part of the
>>foundation of this society.  
>
>the Constitution specifically prohibits `high treason'. Or are we now
>against the Constitution? It's hard to keep track lately.

I see no other interpretation than, "Pseudospoofing is high treason against
the government of the United States of America."

Did you honestly mean this?!?!?!?!?!?!

I mean the rest of the stuff (Ted Bundy similies and the like) is fairly
standard "worst case scenario" justifying government abridgement ordinary
peoples rights and privacies (which as you might suspect, I don't buy for a
second).

But pseudo-spoofing as high treason, in a constitutional sense? Come on
now, you must have not typed what you meant. After all, being against the
constitution ITSELF isn't even high-treason.

PS - Sorry, to all the Detweiler weary cypherpunks, but I couldn't resist.
I tried, but I couldn't.
