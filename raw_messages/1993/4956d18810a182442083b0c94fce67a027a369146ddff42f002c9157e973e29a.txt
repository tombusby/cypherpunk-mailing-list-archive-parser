Richard,


This reminds me of what I had to go through to get approved to get married
in the Roman Catholic Church.  I ended up having to say, for the record, "I
have no intention of using mechanical methods of birth control"
(pre-safe-sex days) when what they wanted was for me to say I would avoid
all birth control.

I'm now ashamed I stooped to that non-confrontive statement (especially
since the marriage didn't last :-).  I should have said, "No, I don't
accept your view of birth control and have every intention of using it."
At least I did say that my fiancee was on the pill and we intended to
continue using it.



I would be happy to review your paper and to suggest others who might
be good reviewers.  Furthermore, I have no intention of violating the
export laws (even though I disagree with them and work very hard to
change them).

However, I do not grant the NSA the power to control the publication of
theoretical information.  I have published papers on cryptology in the
international press, without offering the NSA the chance to review what I
write ahead of time, and I intend to continue doing so.  They have their
internal publications, no doubt, and we have our public ones.  I don't tell
them what to publish internally and I will not allow them to tell me what I
can publish out here in the public.

That is my policy, for my own writing.

If you send me your paper to review, I will not disseminate it.  That's
a matter of respecting your wishes -- not the NSA's.  My acceptance of
your paper will not constitute any agreement on my part to give the NSA
control over publications of ideas.
