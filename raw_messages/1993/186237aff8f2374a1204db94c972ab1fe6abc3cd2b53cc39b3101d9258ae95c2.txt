# Under the conditions Deadbeat described (long tradition of posting from
# anon-server with pgp signatures/keys, keys on the key server, etc.,
# I might be willing to sign such a key.  I wouldn't use my regular key

A few months ago I was willing.  I checked all the old mail I had from
deadbeat and the signatures matched.

# to do it - I'd create one or more nym-signing keys, so people could tell
# that I know I'm signing a nym's key and it's less reliable than
# signing a physically-known person's key.  To do it right, though,

I figure I know Deadbeat electronically as well as, or better than,
most of the Tentacles whom I've met In The Flesh at the mountain view
physical meetings.   So I signed the key that matched the writings that
we all know and love as Deadbeat.  That's what Deadbeat means to
me, not <an5877@anon.penet.fi>.

Here it is, with my "working" signature.  Granted, I'm not
well-connected into the cypherpunk signature web yet.  (And if my
reputation drops due to this act, perhaps I never will be.)

Also, my Real Name is not on my signature, because I consider this
signature less secure than the Real Me.
