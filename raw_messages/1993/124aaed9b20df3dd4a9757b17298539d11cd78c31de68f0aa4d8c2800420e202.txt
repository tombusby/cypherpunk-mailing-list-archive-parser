I still have my copy of (what I call) pgp-ran.  I forgot what it was
called when it was posted and I can't find the sources now.
It puts rannos in PGP format.  Does a copy of the sources exist on one
of the servers?

It's too fast to be doing any encryption but it would be good to have
one which produces messages PGP recognizes as real, only for a public
key which isn't on file.  If PGP rejects a message, it wouldn't take
up any Cray cracking time.
