Letter writers needed ASAP! This is the bill that will open up
legislative databases to the masses and serve as a model for other
states and even the country!

cypherfolks, do you have any idea what these efforts are the faint
glimmers of? Imagine a future society where *anyone* can propose laws,
not just the elite few called Legislators and identified in an
exceedingly time-consuming, tedious, and troublesome process. Imagine
that everyone has complete access and full understanding of all the
laws that affect one's life, and the ability to propose and *pass*
superior modifications. It would be a sort of Legislative Free
Enterprise, a competition in the marketplace of laws such that superior
ones would prosper and inferior, archaic, and absurd laws would be
rooted out and expunged by the citizenry itself, in a very dynamic,
interactive, and responsive process! Far from this bureacratic
nightmare we lumber in daily! Write that small letter to set in motion
this grandiose cyberspatial karma!

>CALIFORNIA LEGISPEAK: "AUTHOR" VS. "SPONSOR" VS. "SUPPORTER"
>  In California legislative circles:
>A bill's AUTHOR is a legislator who introduced the bill.
>A bill's SPONSOR(S) is a person or organization, if any, that requested that 
>the bill be introduced by the bill's author.
>A bill's SUPPORTER(S) is a person or organization that is officially listed 
>as being in favor of the bill, usually including its sponsor(s), if any.
>  All bills have one or more authors.  Some bills do NOT have sponsors.
>  AB1624's author was Assembly Member Debra Bowen.  It had no sponsors, but 
>has a growing number of supporters.
