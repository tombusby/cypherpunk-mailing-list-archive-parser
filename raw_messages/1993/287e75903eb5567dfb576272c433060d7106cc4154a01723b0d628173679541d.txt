Simply to confirm that the file is from who it's supposed to be from.
If I send a file to you with my signature on it (assuming no major security
breaches), you can be absolutely certain that the file came from me.  This
is of tremendous importance if we're dealing with electronic contracts or
the like, but there are plenty of other situations where you need to be sure.
The file itself may or may not be confidential, so it may or may not need to
be encrypted.  The signature is valid either way.

Yep, it's true that most routine e-mail and Usenet postings don't NEED to be
signed, but it's good practice and good propaganda: it helps to promote the
widespread use of crypto, helps spread the word, and gets people in the habit
of doing it.  Believe me, it's not laziness, since as of today it's not too
convenient to send and receive encrypted email without going through gyrations.
Several cypherpunks have come up with good workarounds for this on various
platforms, but we still have a ways to go.
