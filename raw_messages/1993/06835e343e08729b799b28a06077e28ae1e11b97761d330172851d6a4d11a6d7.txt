Yeah, I like that too...  'cept if you need to pass args, it doesn't
provide a covert channel.

I confess to not having read my PGP manuals yet, but is there an
interactive mode to PGP?  If there WERE (hint), then it could be run
as a subprocess of emacs or a mail program and thus be a) more
convenient and b) the whole hub-bub about people snooping your
environment would be a non-issue.
