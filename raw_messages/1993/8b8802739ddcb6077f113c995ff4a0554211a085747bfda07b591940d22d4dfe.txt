Sorry, but I had a period on a line all by itself.  This caused
sendmail to truncate the rest of the message and my signature.  The
post sent through the phantom remailer should clear this up.

  This letter has been sent to a number of UseNet
newsgroups, e-mail lists, newspapers and information
agencies. Carbon copy to administration of Microsoft Corp.

  It is a deplorable fact that in supposedly democratic
country USA considers itself there could be a cases
when someone not in government/public office is persecuted
and loses his/her job for expressing his/her political views.
It is even more deplorable given that it happened to a
person who has undergone persecution and imprisonment
for political motives in former USSR. Now one has to
admit that similar to that of former USSR atmosphere of
fear and oppression routinely exists in and is being
maintained by administration officials of some US companies,
in particular of Microsoft Corporation.

  Here is the case of Mr.Steshenko, Senior Software Engineer
who has been fired by administration of Microsoft Corp.
for participation in discussions on
RUSSIA@ARIZVM1.CCIT.ARIZONA.EDU    and
UKRAINE@ARIZVM1.CCIT.ARIZONA.EDU   e-mail lists.

Those are moderated e-mail lists devoted to discussions
on various political, social, economic, and cultural
topics concerning related countries. As everybody knows,
the disputes and even flames are necessary components
of discussions on these and similar e-mail lists, and
UseNet newsgroups. There are and will always be persons
whose views and opinions do not coincide, or are opposite
to each other. The tolerance to and respect for the
opinion of your opponent are the prerequisites any society
must satisfy to be considered civilized and democratic.
However these basics seem to be unknown to administration
of Microsoft Corp. whose reaction to complains filed by
some paranoiac and hysteric individuals on behalf of
Mr.Steshenko was unexpected and sweeping:

Mr.Steshenko has not been given neither any options,
nor prior warnings. This action of Microsoft constitutes
the case of persecution for political motives typical for
a totalitarian society, where anonymous reports and notes
from informers serve as a basis for oppressive actions.

Hopefully this letter might help urge Microsoft officials
to reconsider their practices. All concerned persons are
welcome to send a protest letters (some follow below) to:

          Mr. Bill Gates
          Microsoft Corp.
          One Microsoft Way
          Redmond, WA 98052
