Great idea!

In the meantime, I put my encrypted return address in my public key and put
them both on the existing servers. I put each line of the return address
into an 'id' of my key, so that with a little editing the return address
can be reassembled. Unfortunately, this will not work in the future,
because new revisions of PGP will not guarantee that the order of id's is
well defined.  Even then, I could number the id's. 

If PGP was totally bulletproof, it could handle carriage returns within a
single id, or at least an id long enough to contain a return address with
the carriage returns replaced with markers. PGP 2.2 bombs if you paste too
long a sting into an id field.
