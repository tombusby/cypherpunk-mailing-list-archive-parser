"Society has recognized over time that certain kinds of scientific inquiry
can endanger society as a whole and has applied either directly, or through
scientific/ethical constraints, restrictions on the kind and amount of
research that can be done in those areas."

-- Adm. Bobby R. Inman (then CIA Dep. Dir.) in a February, 1982 article for
_Aviation_Week_and_Space_Technology_ on why cryptographic research should
be limited to government scientists.  Full text of this article is
available for anonymous ftp from ftp.eff.org as
