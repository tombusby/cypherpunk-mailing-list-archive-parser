I am presently looking into leasing fiber plant to set up a secure net
with some of the attributes Nick Szabo mentions.  Without enhancements
to his scheme, however, I do not see how my cuso tomers can be sure
that I am not recording traffic routine g, even if I claim that I am not.
Furthermore, what is to prevent third parties from taping my      ping my trunks
and decoding the signalling which is used to direct the route switching?
