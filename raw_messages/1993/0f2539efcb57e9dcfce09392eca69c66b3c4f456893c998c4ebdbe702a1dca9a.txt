wow, is this guy a cypherpunk? Gad, this is really mainstream. NYT,
Newsweek, SciAm, and now a cryptographic conference *with* the NSA! 
We've hit the big time.  (Oops, he's from AT&T.)

YIKES, the fireworks are going to fly at this one. CSSPAB (NIST), EFF,
NSA, FBI, SPA all in the same room at the same time. I sure hope
there'll be transcripts of this one. It would sure beat all that
Congressional testimony by far for rancor per bit! Cryptography meeting of the year?
