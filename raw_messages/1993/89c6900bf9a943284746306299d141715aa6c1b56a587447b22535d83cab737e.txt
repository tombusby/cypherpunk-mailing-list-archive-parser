Depends on the locality, but generally you have 2 options: temporarily
disable it with a *code, or get all-call-blocking.  In most areas, as far
as I know all-call-blocking (so you don't have to enter the *code for
every call) is a "special service" or "extra feature" and costs you more. 
This is of course utterly ludicrous, but that's what you'd expect from
semi-monopolies.
