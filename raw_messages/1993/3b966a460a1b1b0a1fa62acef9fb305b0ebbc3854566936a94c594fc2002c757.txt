I'll take your word for it. ;^)  I can only speak from experience.

We simply make a batch file which starts our comm program with all the right
settings?  Simple.  If there are errors, we program around them just like we
do in the real world (tm)  If we don't we hear about it from our users! ;^)
I still have a few possible errors which I haven't programed around on my 
scrYpt, but they are so rare.... ya, I know.  I'll fix em before I release.
