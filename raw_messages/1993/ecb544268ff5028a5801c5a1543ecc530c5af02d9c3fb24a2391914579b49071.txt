Here is a list of PGP sites generated by "archie".  I have checked
sony.com which has PGP 2.2 but have not checked the other sites.
If you know any of these sites to be down, out of date, etc. please
let me know and I'll update the list.  Also let me know of sites
archie did not catch.

Strong crypto is available worldwide, but the Clinton Adminstration
has threatened to ban it in the U.S.  In the age of digitial telecom
and fascist governments, strong crypto is your only guarantee of
electronic privacy.  Get it, learn it, and use it while it's still 
legal!
