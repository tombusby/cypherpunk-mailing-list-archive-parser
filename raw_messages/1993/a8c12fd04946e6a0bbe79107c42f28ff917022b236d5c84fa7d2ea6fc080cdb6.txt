What a great little slogan! Those stickers that say "Intel Inside" could be
modified to say something pithy like "Big Brother Inside."

Crypto Yippies (Cryppies?) might even wander into stores like Fry's and
paste them onto the AT&T phones on display. Professionally-made labels
might even remain for months.

Just another seditious thought.
