Definitely at the Boston (Cambridge) site.

I am very sceptical that the "market share" strategy is the whole strategy
here. I think that while some proponents of Clipper may believe this is
the strategy, DOJ hopes that widespread adoption of Clipper will mute
any opposition to subsequent limitations on other encryption methods.

Let me clarify: I argued that asking tough questions could either force to
the government to reveal its hand or pin the government down to a
statement it would later have to admit was false.

> That is, it's conceivable this plan could begin to unravel fairly soon. 
 
We can only hope.

I believe this is precisely the reason we want to make powerful encryption
ubiquitous as soon as possible. And doing this is one of the reasons I
mentioned my hope for an eventual rapprochment between Jim Bidzos and 
Phil Zimmerman. Regardless of past disagreements, these two have a common
cause now, and we should strive to find a way to quell further public
disagreement and resolve as many differences as possible.

Another clarification: in response to a comment I made at the meeting,
Jim spoke at length about the validity of the RSA patent and about the
validity of his company's procedures. I want Jim and others to understand
that what I'm saying here should not be interpreted as an attack on Jim's
business strategy. I know that Jim is so used to being criticized about
the patent that he has standard responses to those criticisms, but I hope
it's clear that I wasn't criticizing him.

Yes, yes, yes.
