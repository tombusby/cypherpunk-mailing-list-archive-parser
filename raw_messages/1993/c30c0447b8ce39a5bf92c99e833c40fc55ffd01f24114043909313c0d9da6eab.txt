This is not a bug. PGP times your keystrokes when you type your
key id and passphrase, using the timing information for randomness.
If it gets enough randomness from these keystrokes (i.e. if you type
a long id and passphrase), it does not need you to type randomly
because it already has enough random material to generate the key.
You can re-create this by choosing a short (384-bit) key, typing a
long id and passphrase, and typing slowly so that PGP gets a good
random byte from each keystroke. This does not make the key predictable
or cause a loss of security.

Anonymous personal attacks usually say more about the attacker than
about the target. This one is no exception. You have a lot of nerve to talk
about Perry's  "balls" when you don't even have the "balls" to sign your
name to your flame against him. This attack is at about the same cowardly
level as most bathroom-wall graffiti.

P.S. Go ahead and flame me. My address is "mikeingle@delphi.com", make

bigger idiot you reveal yourself to be for wasting all that time in
taking an anonymous potshot at someone.
