Stew Leonard (Hero of Capitalism) whose Stew Leonard's Dairy Store in 
Norwalk, CT has the highest sales per square foot of any retail store in 
the world (allegedly), was busted not because of a computer enforcement 
move by the IRS but because he was arrested smuggling cash out of the 
country.  He was taking 80K to the Bahamas or Caymans or somewhere on his 
private plane.  The Feds didn't say if they got a tip or if it was a spot 
check based on a flight plan.

That was a couple of years ago.  Finally, they raided his store and home 
and found the Equity software.  The programmer should market the code.  It 
would (probably) be legal to do so.

Just goes to show that you computer criminals out there can't neglect your 
physical privacy arrangements.  I could have taught Stew any one of a 
dozen ways to expatriate funds without risk of arrest.  Many of them would 
not even have involved a violation of the laws governing the international 
transfer of monetary instruments.
