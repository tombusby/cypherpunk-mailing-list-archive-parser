I've reread the text again. There seems to be no assurance at all that
S1 and S2 are random or that they are not the same for all chips.
There also seems to be no rational explanation of why N is only thirty
bits long -- its a strange number in the modern world of computing.

The number N is not secret and is not random -- it is therefore not
necessary that the PRNG generate N, and indeed N is not generated, it
is given. Its presumably just an ordinary serial number.

Why not just generate U1 and U2 by a more straighforward approach that
doesn't involve strange padding and odd randomly selected constants?
Indeed, why not just use true random numbers? Surely a radioactive
source isn't unavailable to Mykotronix.

Furthermore, Denning says about 300 chips are programmed in a batch
using baroque methods in a vault. Well, folks, that just won't do if
twenty or thirty million of these babys are being sold a year -- or
even if just five million are sold a year. Seems to me that the
processing is going to have to get more efficient, and likely thus
much more sloppy.
