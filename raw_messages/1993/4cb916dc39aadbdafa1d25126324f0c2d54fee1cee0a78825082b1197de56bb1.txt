I considered (for a couple of seconds) responding to P.M.'s request, but
then decided against it.  I'm sure he's a nice guy, but I generally don't
trust mainstream journalists too much and don't go out of my way to talk
to them.  People may have actually made a decision not to talk to him, so
I wouldn't assume it's "apathy" or anything like that.  (I'm sensitive about
this because people are always accusing anti-voting anarchists of "apathy,"
and that gets us hopping mad.)

On the subject of the T-shirts: I agree that they should not be too, er,
cryptic.  They shouldn't be just a way for us to pat ourselves on the
back and be in-group-ish, but a way to spread the word.  I also think we
should try to accommodate the different political views in the group (which
are not all that different anyway) by avoiding use of the American flag,
references to Jefferson, etc.  We should stick to issues we all agree
on, which there are plenty of: Anti-Big Brother, Anti-NSA/CIA/FBI,
pro-privacy, libertarianism (capital or small "L"), freedom of information,
etc.
