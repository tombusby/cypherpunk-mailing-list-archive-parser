I don't, but as you mention below, it takes so little time, I thought we could
get people involved who may not otherwise give a damn.  "It's so easy, just 
send a quick letter, it will really help us out."   Or something like that.

How about each time we manage to get someone to send a letter to the WH, we also
request that they send it to one of us, so that we can keep track of it?  Is 
this doable accross the many networks?
