 I wanted to trump up a library-like interface using TCL for PGP 2.3[a],
but was told that the "library" will be in the next release.  So I haven't
worked on it.  If the next release of PGP with the library hooks is
<<much hand waving>> some extended time in the future, then I'd go ahead
and do it.  But I haven't been able to get any kind of answer or clue
as to when it will come out.

  Anyone know when the next release of PGP is due?  I'd really really
like to have TCL hooks for some projects, but don't want to waste my
time if I'll only have to start over with PGP X.X (where X.X is > 2.3a).
