This is one of a series of documents defining privacy enhancement
mechanisms for electronic mail transferred using Internet mail
protocols.  This document is the outgrowth of a series of meetings of
the Privacy and Security Research Group (PSRG) of the Internet
Research Task Force (IRTF) and the PEM Working Group of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF).  The author would like to thank the
members of the PSRG and the IETF PEM WG, as well as all participants
in discussions on the "pem-dev@tis.com" mailing list, for their
contributions to this document.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet
community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol
Standards" for the standardization state and status of this protocol.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@CNRI.RESTON.VA.US.  Requests to be added
to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should be sent to
RFC-REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.

Details on obtaining RFCs via FTP or EMAIL may be obtained by sending
an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with the message body
