It shure should be in the help file. But the whole help file needs
to be rewritten. I'm running as fast as I can!

I hate the automatic anonymizing myself, but for historical reasons that
had to be done. Can be fixed in the next reincarnation of the server
if documented clearly enough.

Right. There is a solution, but it has to wait for MK II.

Right.

Right. Amazing, spectacular - maybe, but impending... Sigh...

No. Simply to reduce bandwith - the list is something like 4000 groups
(200K).
