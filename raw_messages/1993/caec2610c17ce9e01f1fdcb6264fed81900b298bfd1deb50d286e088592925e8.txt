Is this an actual Administration quote? If so, they're playing with fire
because France is the very same country that the US has recently
accused of using its national security apparatus to spy on foreign
corporations. It shouldn't be too hard to draw a link between these two
policies that would cause this particular quote to blow up in the
Administration's face.
