Hi.
	I don't know if this address connects to anyone or anything, but I
am giving it a shot. I saw an article in Wired and then another one in the
25th anniversary edition of Whole Earth, and wanted to get in touch with
you all. 
	#1 Thanks for exisiting....... I am real glad someone is on the
side of the angels technologically

	#2 Please put me on a list to get news. I prowl the newsnet very
occasionally, but I don't have a lot of time to do so and I am still
climbing up the looooong learning curve of internet. I am quite willing to
pay for good info feed from you.

	#3 Please help me get a clean copy of PGP. 

	I guess thats all I want to throw out unencrypted.....thanks...I
want to help.

					Wes Bradley

	The return address is my e-mail address at university of colorado
where I am a student in aerospace engineering.

	Thanks again.
