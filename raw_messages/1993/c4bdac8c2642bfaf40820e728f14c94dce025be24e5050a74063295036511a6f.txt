Just what we need -- a whole new field day for the disconsolate Kennedy
conspiracy theorist industry! Maybe they'll let us see *these*
documents in 2050 or so!

(Disclaimer: of course, this has only tangential relevance to the list,
but it has formed one of the hottest, most recurring, and emotional
topics on the list, and hopefully everyone who would flame me for
posting it here has already deleted the message based on the subject
line! so NYAAHH!)

The full text of the request can be found in the United States Federal
Register, Volume 58, Number 156, on Monday August 16, 1993, page 43312.
