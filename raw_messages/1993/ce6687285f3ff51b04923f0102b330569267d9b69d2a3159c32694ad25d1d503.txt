The operating principles (and the early code) was copied from the
general service Karl Kleinpaste was running at godiva. There has been
two long-running servers serving some alt.* groups (alt.sex.*,
alt.sexual.abuse.recovery) for years.

No. Not until now. And you can still post withaout it, and answer
anonymous mail without it, and of course set the password to "none", 
disabling passwords altogether.

I know, looking at the error messages and missent mail, that there would
have been hundreds of persons exposed without the default double-blind.

No, once you set a password, the server won't let your message through
unless it's OK!

Can you elaborate? I don't understand your question. Sorry, my english
isn't what it ought to be...

I beg to disagree.

Right. Unfortunately. Because had you followed the discussion in
news.admin.policy you would have realized thet sticking your head in the
bush isn't going to help.
