This is true, but it's not precisely the issue with regard to encryption

Providing the key would not be seen as legally identical to providing
the unencrypted document.

Unfortunately, this has not been Fifth Amendment law for a long time.
If a search and seizure takes place at your house, and the investigating
agents find your diary, they can use it against you. If the diary is
in code, they can attempt to decode it.
