4th Cypherpunks meeting, London
-------------------------------

Will be held Saturday, 20 February 1993, at 1400 in the office of:

  FOREST
  4th Floor
  2 Grosvenor Gardens
  London  SW1W 0DH
  071-823-6550

This location is 2 blocks from Victoria Station, at the corner
of Hobart Place, near Buckingham Palace.  The entrance is the
very last at the end of the office block, and is diagonally
across the street from a cabbie shelter and a bank of BT
payphones.  If you have trouble finding us, call the above
number or page me on 081-812-2661.

Attendees, as always, are encouraged to bring their laptop and
portable computers, for on-site PGP public key exchange and
certification.  Those who have already generated PGP 2.n public
keys, but who aren't bringing their own machines, should bring
diskettes with their public keys.  As is usually the rule in
this crowd, please don't copy your secret key on these
diskettes...

Amongst the usual topics of discussion will be:

    *  An introduction to data privacy for novices
    *  Further developments in U.K. anonymous remailers
    *  Further developments in U.K. PGP key servers (telnet,
         ftp, email)

.. and some interesting developments in re attempted
anti-privacy legislation in the U.K. and elsewhere.

Our special guest Saturday will be Dr. Whitfield Diffie, who
will join us informally for the meeting, before his return to
the U.S.  It looks to be a good meeting.  All are welcome.

In liberty,
