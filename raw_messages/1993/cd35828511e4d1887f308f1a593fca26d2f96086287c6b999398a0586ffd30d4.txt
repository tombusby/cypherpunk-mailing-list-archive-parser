Given that somebody using your account in '91 posted an article to sci.crypt
about factoring under the name "Lawrence Detweiler", I suppose that either
Larry or Lance might be a reasonable guess... if perhaps overly familiar.
What nickname do you prefer, if any?

Does this make me a pseudopod of the ubiquitous anonymous organism?  Will
Suicide Squid come out of retirement to counter this new evil?  Is L.
Detweiler the Colo State equivalent of C-MU's Harry Q. Bovick?  The world
wonders...
