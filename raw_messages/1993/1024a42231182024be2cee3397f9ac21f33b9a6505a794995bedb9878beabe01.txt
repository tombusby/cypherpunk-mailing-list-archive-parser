I edited down the pgp.hlp file so that it's more readable (for me anyway).
In case you think that the help file is less than helpful, just replace it.

PGP maintainers:  please add this (or an even more concise version) to the
pgp distribution...contrib directory is fine.

------------
Here's a quick summary of PGP v2.2 commands.

pgp ciphertextfile [-o plaintextfile]		decrypt or verify signature

pgp -e textfile her_userid			encrypt file w/ pubkey
pgp -e textfile userid1 userid2 userid3		multiple recipients
pgp -s textfile [-u your_userid]		sign plaintext file
pgp -es textfile her_userid [-u your_userid]	sign, then encrypt

pgp -c textfile			traditional symmetric cipher only

KEY MANAGEMENT:

pgp -kg				generate your own unique key pair
pgp -ka keyfile [keyring]	add new key(s) to your keyrings	

pgp -kx userid keyfile [keyring]	extract (copy) a key from a keyring
pgp -kxa userid keyfile [keyring]	same, except it's ascii

pgp -kv[v] [userid] [keyring] 	view the contents of your public ring
pgp -kvc [userid] [keyring]	view the "fingerprint" of a public key

pgp -kc [userid] [keyring] 	check signatures of public keys

pgp -ke userid [keyring]	edit userid/pass-phrase for your keypair
pgp -ke userid [keyring]	edit the trust parameters for a public key

pgp -kr userid [keyring]	remove a key (or userid) from your pubring

pgp -ks her_userid [-u your_userid] [keyring]	sign/certify a public key
pgp -krs userid [keyring]	remove selected signatures from a pubkey

pgp -kd your_userid		revoke your key & issue compromise certificate
pgp -kd userid			disable or reenable a key on your pubring

ESOTERIC USAGES:

pgp -d ciphertextfile		decrypt message and leave its signature 
pgp -sb textfile [-u your_userid]	create signature separate from textfile
pgp -b ciphertextfile		detach signature from a signed message

OTHER FLAGS 
	-a (ascii)	produce ascii radix-64 output suitable for email
	-m (more)	read in more mode, force reading in more mode
	-w (wipe)	erase plaintext after encrypting
	-f (filter)	input from stdin and output to stdout
	-t (text)	when encrypting, treat input as ascii text
	-p		when decrypting, recover original filename

	Ex: pgp -feast her_userid <inputfile >outputfile
