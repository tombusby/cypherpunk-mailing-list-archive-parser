My C-punks feed comes over a UUCP connection, and I only poll once or twice 
per day, under normal circumstances. I'd likely never notice a 6-hour delay, 
and hence wouldn't give a shit one way or the other.

Delaying message posting seems likely to exacerbate the "ask a question,
get the same answer 8 times" problem.

If we're going to reward some behaviors and punish others, I'd prefer to see 
something that'd create exponentially increasing delays for > 1 post per 
person per 24 hours; of course, remailers make that impractical.

Imposing a digital signature requirement strikes me as an arbitrary 
exercise of authority which would be largely without benefit. I doubt that 
people interested in the C-punks list are the folks who need to be dragged 
kicking & screaming into the 21st century; at least not in terms of personal 
use of technology. :)

Count mine as a "NO" vote; let's talk about the delay thing again when we 
come up with a filter that can spot "what is [anarchy|libertarianism] 
anyway?" or bogus pseudo-economic jibberish.
