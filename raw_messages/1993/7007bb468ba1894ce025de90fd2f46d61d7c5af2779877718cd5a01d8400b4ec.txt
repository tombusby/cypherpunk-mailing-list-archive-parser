| I'm not saying that CRM actually uses a command language (it can't--
| nothing has been agreed upon/worked out yet!) but tools like CRM
| would be able to use a remailer command language to tailor the

| See that same long, boring post I made about a few suggestions

CRM doesn't do anything grandiose.  All it does is pick a random path of a
specified length from a list of remailers, and wrap up an input file with
remailing requests, encrypted PGP tags, and nested PGP encryptions.

For example, if you start out with a file like:

- -+---snip-----
Subject:  Just a test...

I'm going to wrap up this file with CRM and make a /bin/sh script that
will mail it to myself through a chain of remailers.

- -+---snip-----

and do one of these:

c:\>crm infile astrashe@nyx.cs.du.edu

you'll end up (with no further intervention on your part) with the /bin/sh
script that's at the end of this post.

If you run that script, it will mail the above short note to me through a
chain of three remailers.  Each of the remailers gets PGP encrypted input. 
The subject line will show up as the subject on my mailer.  (Please don't run
the script;  my mailbox is full enough already.)

The reason I had CRM wrap the final output in a script is that because the
chain of remailers is random, the first remailer in the chain varies each time
CRM is invoked.  This way you don't have to worry about keeping track which
one to mail the cyphertext to.

This is obviously more of a hassle than using elm to send your mail;  but if
you're already writing letters offline and uploading them (which you ought to
be doing anyway, to take full advantage of PGP's protection), it's only
marginally more difficult than mailing stuff without the remailers.  And it
could be argued that it's *easier* to use CRM and the remailers than standard
mailing, because the shell script keeps track of the subject lines and the
destination for you.  You could write ten letters, wrap them with CRM, keep
concatenating the new scripts onto a outgoing mail file, then upload the whole
thing at once and mail it in one fell swoop.

If you want a copy of CRM, let me know.  (Write to astrashe@nyx.cs.du.edu, not
the return address on this post).  It's an msdos program, written in turbo
pascal.
