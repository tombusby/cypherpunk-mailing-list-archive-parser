I called the phone number for NIST given in one of the announcements,
and was routed to Sherry Hankey 1-301-975-2820, who faxed me their
package of information they're sending out.  There's no new technical
information (Dorothy Denning's article and some non-technical viewgraphs),
but there's a lot of newspaper clippings, pro and con, the announcements
we've seen on the net from Clinton, Q&A, etc., and what look like
viewgraphs from a couple of talks.  Overall, it looks like they don't know
much more than we do :-).   One talk is
	"U.S. Technology Initiative for Secure Telecommunications"
	Raymond G. Kammer, Acting Director, NIST, 4/16/93
which is basically the announcements turned into viewgraphs
(if I've sucessfully decoded the tangle of fax paper :-).

Another part of the package looks like another talk,
which covers Wiretap cases by the FBI and other agencies,
including a summary table for 1982-1991 of State and Federal wiretap
authorizations, arrests, and convictions (there's a footnote that
reporting of convictions seems to substantially lag actual convictions,
though the ration of arrests to convictions has decreased, averaging
2:1 over 10 years, 3:1 recently.)  Most wiretaps are State and local, not FBI.
Cases they cited included the usual drug dealing and money laundering,
a judge taking bribes, a Chicago street gang El Rukn proposing to
shoot down an airliner for the Libyans, some Mafiosi, a RICO case
against the Concrete and Cement Workers Union "Prevented economic loss $585Mil",
some fraud in defense contracting and health care contracting, and
the Masters of Disaster "computer hackers" case.
