Here's what's up: some alarming malfunctions of navigational instruments
were traced to consumer electronics in use by passengers.  The worst
offenders were CD players, but laptops etc were also found to cause trouble.

Eventually, aircraft will be retrofitted for greater immunity to this, and
of course laptops will probably be developed with reduced RF emissions so
that business travellers can use them in flight.  (In case it isn't clear,
all of these devices emit radio frequency energy which can seriously fuck up
radio frequency navigational equipment and onboard computers.)  

Anyway, until the tech upgrades come down the line, leave your laptop and CD
player in the overhead luggage rack.  The small increment of pleasure or
convenience gained by using these things in the air can't begin to compare
with the risk of causing a fatal accident.
