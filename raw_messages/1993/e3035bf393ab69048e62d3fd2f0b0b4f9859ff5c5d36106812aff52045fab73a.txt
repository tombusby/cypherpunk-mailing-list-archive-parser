This is normal. PGP labels each message with a byte that defines its type
(for messages between people this is a byte that indicates that what follows
is public key encrypted) followed by type dependant information. Among the
things in the first bunch of bytes are the KeyID (low order 64 bits, so this
is eight of the bytes you see) of the destination's key. If you are always
sending to the same person (i.e., the same key) these will always be the same.
