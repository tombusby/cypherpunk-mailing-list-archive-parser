As somebody else mentioned, you do want to turn off LAPM/V.42bis when
running a speech application, because speech is a real-time application
and LAPM retransmissions introduce delay. Compression is not likely
to add much but delay either, since the vocoder itself is already
compressing the speech much more effectively than V.42bis, which is
designed specifically for textual information.

Almost all modern modems support synchronous terminals, although the
feature is rarely used. This is how you get around wasting 2 bits out
of every 10 on start and stop bits.
