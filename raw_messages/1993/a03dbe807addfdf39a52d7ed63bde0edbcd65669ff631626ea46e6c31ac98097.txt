The problem is this: when someone responds to your anonymous ID
anon.435@pax, their mail _from_ Pax does not come from anon.435.
Anon.435 is _your_ id.  Instead, their mail from Pax comes from their
own anonymous ID (possibly a newly allocated one).  Then, when the
mail goes to Penet, it sees this new "From" ID and allocates one of
its own.

The same thing happened when you sent to anon.435@pax from your
system which already had a Pax ID.  When the mail was forwarded from
Pax to Penet, it was not marked as coming from anon.435.  Instead,
it was marked as coming from this already-assigned Pax ID. (I don't
think you ever said what that already-assigned ID was.)  Penet had
not seen that ID before, so it allocated an alias for it and sent
back to that ID.  Penet's mail-back would _not_ go to anon.435, but
rather to the Pax ID which it was replying to.
