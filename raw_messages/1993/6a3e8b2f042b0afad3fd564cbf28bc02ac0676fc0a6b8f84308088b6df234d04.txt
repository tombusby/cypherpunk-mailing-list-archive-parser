Mike Ingle quotes Matt Blaze (and I paraphrase):

This is out of band WRT the encryption engine.  Note that it can be used
exactly like an asymmetric encryption key for authentication.  You know the
other persons signature/voice in advance and it is hard for an attacker to
reproduce it.

The 'replay' attack.  Of course you always make the other person say the
hash _and_ some (never reused?) data in a lump (re: my earlier post --
concatenate your challenge data with their a^x before signing) for
instance: "Bob, please sing me the hash to the tune of 'Raindrops Keep
Fallin' on My Head'" (Security can be fun).


  >Or introduce enough line noise so the person couldn't recognize your

Signature not valid.  Sorry Bob, I'll have to call you back.  That is, _if_
it's really you.
