Well, while I am personally of the opinion that this undertaking is of
neglible value for the sweat expended anyway, I would suggest that the
eventual note (if any) not presume to represent anyone but the
individual signatories.

 BK> On the other hand I am repenting my suggestion that we _might_ include

Good.  The surreal laundry-list of crackpot causes in CPSR's written
agenda has gained them my absolute opposition & has probably turned off
others as well.  It would be a mistake for Cypherpunks to drag in
outside issues.

 BK> I don't think it should be "cutesy"

Of course not.  There's no quicker way to the bit bucket, assuming this
entire e-mail flap isn't a bad joke in the first place.

Me three.

A good point!  Nothing impresses bureaucrats like "experts" [cough!].

 >>5) Offer to help.  Offer to make timely review of proposed policies.

You wouldn't like it.
