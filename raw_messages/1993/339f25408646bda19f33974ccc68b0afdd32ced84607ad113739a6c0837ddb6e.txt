I've been sitting back, watching the signal-to-noise on the list
fluctuate with a smidgeon of a grin on my face.
 
"Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!"

Personally, I think that the list is just going through a few minor 
changes, the worst of which are new people checking into "something that 
they had heard about."

Face it -- the net grows a bit more "open" every day.

As far as Dan Rather goes, I'd bet he wouldn't even understand.
