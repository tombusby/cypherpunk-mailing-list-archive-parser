>
>The second is that not only have we not built this machine, but we

>Finally, I don't think that DES is dead.  After about 15 years of
>public scrutiny, we can conclude that DES is a well designed cipher
>with a well understood limitation (56-bit keys).  A natural
>replacement for it is triple-DES.  Proclaiming the death of DES
>may lead to its being replaced with an entirely new cryptosystem
>(e.g. Skipjack).

>>Michael Weiner presented a paper at Crypto93 that describes a fast DES
>>key search engine that uses a special inside-out DES chip that he designed.
>>This chip takes a single plaintext/ciphertext pair and quickly tries 
>>DES keys until it finds one that produces the given ciphertext from the
>>given plaintext.  Weiner can get these chips made for $10.50 each in quantity,
>>and can build a special machine with 57000 of these chips for $1 million.
>>This machine can exhaust the DES key space in 7 hours, finding a key
>>in 3.5 hours on the average.  He works for Bell Northern Research in 
>>Ottawa, and says they have not actually built this machine, but he has
>>the chip fully designed and ready for fabrication.

>>This is a stunning breakthrough in the realization of practical DES
