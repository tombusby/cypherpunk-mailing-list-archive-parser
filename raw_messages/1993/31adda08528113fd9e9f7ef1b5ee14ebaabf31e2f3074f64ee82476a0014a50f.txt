Institutions -- individuals, groups of individuals, companies -- should
have the right to private communication.  (In terms of e-mail, this
means that one knows where all copies of their letters are and has the
power to erase them?)

The right of government employees to private communication is limited
by one important factor:  many of these individuals are empowered to
use force against citizens, and they responsibile for justifying the
use of this force.  (Examples of what I mean by force:  arresting and
putting people in jail, searching, seizing, impounding, levying taxes,
wiretapping, shooting alleged criminals).  Anyone given this kind of
power has a heavy burden of proof and had better be able to prove
beyond a shadow of doubt that their actions are justified.

The burden should not be on individuals to constantly be open to
scrutiny to demonstrate their innocence, but on those with the
power to suspend individual rights.
