Hello, I've been following the T-shirt & cypherpunk meanderings. Fun! A few ideas:

- as for graphic designs, it is amazingly easy to get absolutely
stunning graphics from raytracers & fractal image generators. I would
suggest chrome or glass letterings on checkerboard planes stretching to
infinity (does anyone know of sites for 3d letter geometries?) 

- the merchandising could be potentially lucrative, esp. if the designs
are beautiful and inspiring and interesting to people that have no
connections to the group directly. I suggest that a cypherpunk fund be
set up for some modest percentage of profits for group projects, such
as meetings or mailings or whatever. sellers should indicate how much
they will donate. If you think the fund would be mismanaged (money has
a tendency to warp people), feel free to donate nothing!

- In some ways the shirts should be very broadly appealing, if they are
then many non-cyberpunks will buy them and our message will spread like a virus!

Here are a lot of brainstormed ideas for mottos. If anyone makes
fantastic profit from them I get a share :) A long time ago (in
cyberspatial terms), I suggested `Cypherpunks do it secretly!' for T
shirts, so I've had plenty of time to think!

- Cypherpunks: The Cyberspatial Colonialists
- We the Cypherpunks, In Order to Form a More Perfect Cyberspace
- Give Me Privacy or Give Me Stealth
- I Regret that I have but One Life to Live in Cyberspace
- I Regret that I have but One Tshirt for the Cypherpunks
- Ask *not* what the NSA can do for you; ask what you can do to the NSA!
- Clip the Clipper (picture of crushed/exploding chip under hammered, clenched fist)

- Stop the Spooks! circle/red line through spy figure
- Cypherpunks: Guerrila Cryptologists. Picture of rambo-like figure
wielding a sword like a pen. Maybe PGP themes here.
- Cypherpunks vs. National Spooks Anonymous (jab at NSA). The idea here
would be to mimic/parody a t-shirt for a big sporting event.
- Cypherpunks with variation on Markoff's quote: no more
self-consciously ornery group in all of cyberspace!
- Picture of Jefferson with caption Grade A Cypherpunk (I kind of like this one)

other pictures elsewhere on the bill. Maybe text all in those
computer-type fonts. Digital Cash. In Cryptography We Trust (a bit
pagan, but oh well). Legal tender for all debts, public and private.

flapping with digital variations. Maybe computer screens in the place of stars?

really hammered at T. Foley?

- ``If it had gone off exactly as planned, everything would have been
perfect'' (FBI quote on the Waco raid, but works for Steve Jackson, Clipper, etc.)
