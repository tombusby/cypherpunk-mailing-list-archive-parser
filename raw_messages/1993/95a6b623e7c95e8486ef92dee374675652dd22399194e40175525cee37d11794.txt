   Why should it be? Reasonably secure encryption, reasonably
open access, and reasonably secure privacy of data can all be
implemented without accountability. (I refer you to Public Key
cryptography, DC/Mix nets, and secret sharing) Perhaps in practice,
the majority of people will refuse to participate in such a network but
that does not stop crackers/pirates from using one. Crackers routinely
dick each other over because of lack of accountability, but the trade off
(getting free software/phone access) is better than (getting busted)

   Do you think I am accountable? If I didn't put my real name in my
sig you'd never be able figure out who I really am. Not even gnu, who
graciously allows me use of their machines, has my real address or phone.
The annex port that I log in on is set up incorectly allowing me to 
telnet anywhere without needing to use my student account (and thus not
linking rjc@ to my college where my really private info resides)

   rjc@ is simply my pseudonym. I could be Bill Clinton and you
wouldn't know, so why worry about it? What keeps me in line in the
reputation linked to rjc@ which I have spent a long time building up.
Acting like an asshole and choosing a new account name would waste a lot
energy that I put into posting these years.

   If you consider a BlackNet in terms of Interated Prisoner's Dilemma, it
makes sense that the good guys will outnumber the bad with a minority of
jerks (who can be controlled with intelligent filtering software)

  You made the assertion, the proof is up to you.
