>another, local-area laws should be handled by local areas.  Period.
>In my opinion.
>
>The main objection I keep seeing is that all them loonies will vote for
>stupid laws.  I'd like to ask you how many of these people vote NOW?  Not

>Anyway, when some of this comes about, and it is quite inevitable, I would
