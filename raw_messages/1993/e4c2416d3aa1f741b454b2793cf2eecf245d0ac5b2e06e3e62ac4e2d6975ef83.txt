Watch the nightly news or if you want to be really anal about it look up 
statistics about the increase in violent carjacking.
Walk down the street in any San Francisco neighborhood, and count the piles 
of tempered glass that used to be car windows.

So OK, you don't have a criminal mind, and it makes sense to you
that it might be a good time to go legit, but let me offer you my
sincere advice not to move into a bad neighborhood, you are at a natural 
disadvantage.

tightly focused linear thinkers are perfect targets for criminally minded
predators, they are assured that you will leave them a wide arena from
which to operate undetected.

Recently a Cash machine was installed in a building which I frequent.
It was placed 10 feet inside a plate glass window, and has easy access
for a small truck to drive up and haul it away. It even has wheels.

I noted that this presented a danger to those of us who were in the building
late at night, since it was apparently so vulnerable.

I was concerned that the unarmed security guard was a sitting duck,
and perhaps target practice, for theives intent on driving through the window 
and quickly hauling the whole shebang away.

The cash machine installer informed me that the unit had a cel phone and GPS
that would call and give its location if tampered with, but he didn't have
an answer when I remarked that this would be littel comfort to anyone
shot or injured by thieves unaware of this factor.

and please don't tell me that posting signs telling would-be criminals
about these security precautions will do any good.
They won't.

You are making an error if you think that any locks keep out anything
but honest people.

Necesity is the mother of invention.

The point is that these issues are not linear, when implemented in real
world situations you must consider the real world implications and 
provide real world solutions.
