At least one service, similar to what you describe, already
exists.  It was created primarily to take advantage of the low
long distance/international rates available only from the US.
Incoming calls to the US typically cost 2-3 times as much as
outgoing calls to the same countries.

Once you have an account, you can call a special number in the
US, key in your private code, and hang up.  You will immediately
be called back by the service.  When you answer, you will here an
American dial tone.  You may then dial any number in the world.
The service charges you a fee that is substantially less than the
international rates charges in your home country.  Of course, it
also allows you to call US 800 numbers, as well.

The company, ITS, offers other services including programs for
Americans (or anybody) travelling abroad.  For more information,
