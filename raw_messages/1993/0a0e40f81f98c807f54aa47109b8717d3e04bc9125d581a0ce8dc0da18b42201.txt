This whole problem looks to me to be AI-complete.  I mean, I can't  
understand the manual from my Roland synth without a whole lot of  
head-scratching, and that was translated by a human!  I don't think  
you're going to see a computer program giving intelligible rephrasing  
any time soon.  The burden of disguising writing style may continue  
to fall on the author, but if everyone has the tools to statistically  
analyze their own messages before they send them, they'll at least  
see what they need to change around before sending.  [I, for example,  
might decide to use sentences with fewer than three clauses...]
