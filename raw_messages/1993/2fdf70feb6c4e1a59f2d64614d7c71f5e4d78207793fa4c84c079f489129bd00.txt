For a sneak preview of the MPJ2 Encryption Algorithm article I just submitted
to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, anonymous ftp to csn.org and
look in the mpj directory or call my BBS at 303-938-9654.  I used the 
same mechanism used by rsa.com to isolate the nonexportable stuff (source 
code, programs) from the Constitutionally protected publication (article 
describing the algorithm).  Seems strange to me, but if it works for the 
Department of State and rsa.com thinks it won't get them in trouble, then 
I guess I'm not sticking my neck out too far.

Any technical types among you want to take a look at the algorithm and 
tell me what you think about its security?  I've been trying to break it for
several years, but I'm just an amateur who reads a lot.

Why MPJ2 and not just IDEA or 3DES?  Never put all your crypto eggs in 
one basket.  Besides, MPJ2 is royalty-free.  Go build some useful code or 
hardware.  (MPJ2 is faster and simpler in hardware, once the key is set up).
