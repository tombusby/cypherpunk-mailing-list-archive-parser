Considering that human nature allows for pathological behavior in some 
individuals, and that anonymity seemingly decreases the potential for
being held acountable for pathological behavior, I think it follows that 
it would be unwise NOT to be concerned.

You may also find that such gentile methodology as attempting to sway
opinion or unfairly weight ones opinion in order to alter the 
flow of disscussion are the least you can expect.

I bet that clever sociopaths will find ways to leverage anonymity
schemes to accomplish mayhem of magnitude well beyond these sort of things.

believe me, you don't want to find out by being subjected to such mayhem, 
and if it happens you will be much harder pressed to come up with ways
to patch things than if you take time to try and deal with it now.

How about *credentials* that certify the capabilities or flag the 
potential dangers of a binary object.
Aren't there schemes out there that hold promise for that sort of
*trustworthiness* stamp of approval?
Aren't such schemes prone to the potential of cliquish abuse?

what are you credentialing? that someone *should* know what they are 
talking about? even so it would not preclude being burned, psychopaths
tend to be very clever?

why not just build your reputation as the psuedo right from the start?

Oh, I don't know anybody who does that sort of thing! :-)
do you ?

If all you'r talking about is mail-list or newsgroup membership, why not just
have testing and stringent membership requirements?

exactly.
I don't think it's ironic, I will be disapointed if the cypher-head
community doesn't pay attention to the disphoric aspects of the 
technology it wields. Would you like to be the Edward Teller of cypher ?

I don't think so.

I want privacy too, and I want as much free-wheeling as possible in the
matrix. Personally I think that accountability is going to be required
as the price for reasonably secure encryption, reasonably open access,
and reasonably secure privacy of data. 
IMNSHO, it is unreasonable to expect an anarcho-libertarian outcome to
these issues. If you can prove me wrong I will be thrilled.

The other thing that I am a bit surprized about is the relatively tight
focus in this group regarding text.

It seems to me that multimedia extensions have an *unfolding of the lotus*
like effect upon the issues involved.
I also see very little regarding potential for breaking the mind machine
link, or biologic interfaces?

core technologies are important, but an eye on the future is just as important.
