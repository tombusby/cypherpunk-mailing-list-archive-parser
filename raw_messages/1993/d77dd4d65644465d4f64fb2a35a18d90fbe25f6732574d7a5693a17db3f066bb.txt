Cypherpunks,

Are there any heavy implications, security and otherwise, to the
truncation of the environment variable PGPPATH that occurs in
buildfilename()?

Background: I've been trying all sorts of stuff getting pgp to read
config.txt when I'm anywhere else in my directory structure.  My home
directory is /home/klbarrus which as it turns out is a symbolic link
another directory (it may even change from time to time).  Since I
never could get PGPPATH to work on my old NeXT account, and my home
directory there was also a link to something else, I thought: AHA!
PGP uses stat() and/or some other functions which don't follow
symbolic links!!

Nope, it does, so that wasn't it.

So, I poked around the code more and found out that buildfilename()
returns null if the length of getenv(PGPPATH) is greater than 50.
This probably explains why it didn't work on the NeXT; PGPPATH was set
to some huge path like /private/Net/tree/Users/barrus/Cryptography/pgp
or something close, so buildfilename() returned null.  But the
pathname on my new account is definitely shorter than 50 characters,
but I decided to try increasing 50 just to see what it would do.

Right before remaking pgp I realized the mistake I had made, one that
is (export) almost too embarrasing to admit :-)

Anyway, any "deep" reason to return null if the length of the
environment variable is > 50?  Or is it just to keep the path
relatively short, maybe to keep from breaking a system call on some
machine out there?
