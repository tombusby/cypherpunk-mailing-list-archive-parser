Sorry this is late, but I was delaying waiting for the uclink
remailer's public key to be released, plus, I'm still not getting
responses from remailer@dis.org (but at least I'm not getting bounced
mail).  Some users have informed me that they were able to use
remailer@dis.org, so that's good!

Check out the pub/cypherpunks directory at soda.berkeley.edu
(128.32.149.19).  Instructions on how to use the remailers are in the
remailer directory, along with some unix scripts and dos batch files.

Mail to me (elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu) for further help and/or questions.

* I've had others tell me that they have successfully used this
remailer, but I still don't get any responses...will keep trying!
