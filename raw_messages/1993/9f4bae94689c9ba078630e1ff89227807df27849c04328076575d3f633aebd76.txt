As always the UK is ahead of the curve on this one.  It is still possible 
in certain UK apartments to pay gas *and* electricity bills anonymously.  
The electricity and gas meters have coin boxes on them.  You want 
electricity or gas and you just put the coins it.  True.  This used to be 
the standard method of paying for utilities.

This is less common for electricity now but any office of British Gas will 
still sell you plastic "keys" that are shaped like keys.  They turn on 
your gas for a set period of time and presumably break off in the process 
so they can't be reused.

Cutting-edge high tech!
