Well, there's an easier end-run: a piggyback board.  This would plug into
the Clipper's slot, and the Clipper would plug into it.  Then it could either
run in Clipper or PGP/DH-IDEA/Whatever mode.  I don't understand enough
about the Clipper protocols and interface to know whether there's room to
squeeze in bits to signal which of these two modes, unbeknownst to the
rest of the phone, but you could certainly attach a Clip vs. Secure switch.
