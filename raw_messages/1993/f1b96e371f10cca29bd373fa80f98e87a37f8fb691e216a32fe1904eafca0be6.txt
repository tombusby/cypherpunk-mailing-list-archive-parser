           The Sternlight Tyger (Apologies to Wm. Blake)
 
 
              Sternlight, Sternlight, burning bright
              From the flamings left and right, 
              What group covert or front pontific
              Dare frame thy postings so prolific.
 
              From what cloistered chamber flows
              The torrents of your party prose?
              Who foots the bill? Who pays the piper?
              Are you saint or are you viper?
 
              Are you the likes of Walter Mitty
              Or just another gov-committee
              Whose Dole-ful charge, we must confess,
              Is simply to obstruct progress.*
 
              When the Evil Empire of the Left
              Gave up the ghost (of cash bereft),
              Did he smile his work to see
              Did he who made the spooks make thee?
 
              Sternlight, Sternlight, burning bright
              From the flamings left and right, 
              What group covert or front pontific
              Dare frame thy postings so prolific.
