While this sounds like a great idea, I'm not sure you'll find many ravers
who eill actually use PGP. How many ravers exchange email, but haven't
heard of PGP? It seems like only a couple, based on my talking to people
about computers at raves.

This seems like a more practical tactic. Even just handing out a single or
half-page flier about PGP, Clipper, and a couple of other topics would
probably get a lot of people to read it. And people at raves are used to
others going around handing out interesting things to read. The hard part
is coming up with 300 well written words that cover everything that needs
to be said, a task I leave in more capable hands.

On the other hand, I wouldn't mind lugging my PowerBook 170 down to a
rave... If anyone organizes such an event, drop me a line...
