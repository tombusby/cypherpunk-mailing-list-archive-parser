One easy way around this is to have completely anonymous customers:
The store doesn't record any id at all.  The simplest way to do this
is to have customers make a cash deposit large enough to cover
replacement costs of the videos.  You would have to limit the number
of videos, especially/only for those without a track record.

You could even leave an anon email id to allow them to remind you to
return an overdue video, etc.

The only risk here is that someone besides the account owner might
'close' the account and take the deposit.  A good 'id' card/number
should solve that.

Actually, around here, that isn't too far from what you end up with
after being a customer for a year: I've moved, changed phone numbers
and have a new VISA, since the old one expired.  I'm sure they still
have my dr. lic. num and maybe even my ssn though.

Not even knowing that you're a customer seems better than trying not
to track which videos you have.

How about an anon deposit service that multiple companies (utilities,
etc.) could put claims on, similar to VISA holds.
