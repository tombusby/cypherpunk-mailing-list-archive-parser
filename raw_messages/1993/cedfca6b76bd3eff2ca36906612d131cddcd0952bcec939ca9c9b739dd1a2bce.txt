Why should how long I have been on the list have anything to do with what I
can contribute?

Why should I wait a month to figure it out experimentaly when I can ask a
couple of questions now, race up the learning curve, and move on to othe
more important agendas.

We are talking about limiting access to the list (for whatever reason), THAT
is cencorship.


I personaly find the idea that a person has to 'earn' the right to make a
statement on a mail-list or newsgroup as counter-free speech. I oppose your
view.



How long have you been playing w/ computers? Maby you haven't been doing it
long enough to make posts either....
