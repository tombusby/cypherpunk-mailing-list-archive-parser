Just to let you know, this *is* happening.  I got so pissed off at the
postings here from anonymous remailers that I've now put them in my
kill file. (I gate this stuff into a local newsgroup and read it with
a newsreader).

Actually it wasn't the content of the articles that narked me, it was
that I actually wanted to *reply* to the authors.  However the subjects
were way too off-topic to be worth responding to in public, which is
the only option the anonymous remailers allows.  I've no objections
(and haven't kill'd) articles from penet etc that I can reply to.

I'm not entirely happy with the whole concept of 'hit&run' anonymous
remailers - they're only good for throwaway comments on public lists, 
or whistleblowing.  That's not how they're being used - they're forcing
people to have private conversations in public lists like this, which
I think is unfair to the rest of the list community - I'm *sure* it's
contributed to the number of people dropping off this list lately.
