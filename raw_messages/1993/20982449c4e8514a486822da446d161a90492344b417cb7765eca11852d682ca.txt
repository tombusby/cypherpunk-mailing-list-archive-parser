One note on the other side of the coin:

Email announcements of the conference began in December of '92, including
the complete pricing schedule:

> Registration Fees are: 
>       If mailed by:       7 February        8 March         on site 
>       Conference Fees:      $300             $355             $405
>       Tutorial Fees:        $135             $165             $195
>       Conference & Tutorial $435             $520             $600

Note that there was over a month's time to get registered at $300, and the
price of registration is currently $355, *not* $405.

Now I have to pay the $355 out of my own pocket (as Magic decided not to
pay my way) and I understand the pain you feel with having to shell out
such big bucks.  But, for one reason or another, I believe that CFP has not
done incredibly well financially, and they've got to cover their ass.  One
way to do that is by encouraging early registration, which smooths the
planning process.

So get your registration in now!

On the other hand, Glenn Tenney has done a remarkable job in keeping the
price of Hackers down...
