For a good survey paper of knapsack cryptosystems, see [1].

   Third -- and this is what sunk the knapsack problem -- you need a
   cryptosystem that exploits the full NP-complete problem, as opposed
   to just a simple case.  (The knapsack problem was solvable by someone
   who knew the key because it wasn't a general knapsack, but a super-
   increasing sequence -- each number in it was greater than the sum
   of all of its predecessors.  (This was the simplest version; there
   were, I believe, some others.))

Even knapsack cryptosystems that exploit the full NP-complete problem
may still be susceptible to general attacks, depending on their density
(a property of the weights of the knapsack problem).  If the weights
$a_i$ are too large, you get a "low-density knapsack" (i.e. you're
sending lots of bits of cyphertext to hide few bits of plaintext).

Brickell [2] and Lagarias and Odlyzko [3] showed that there are general
attacks against subset-sum problems with density < 0.6463...  In [4] we
showed that this bound can be improved to about 0.9408...  Joux and
Stern came up with essentially the same result at about the same time
[5].  (Note that if your density is > 1, then you have the possibility
of two different plaintexts encrypting to the same ciphertext.  Without
more information, the encryption can be ambiguous.)

We combined our two techniques in a joint paper -- you can get it via
anon. FTP from martigny.ai.mit.edu in pub/bal/sumcc.ps, if you're
interested.
