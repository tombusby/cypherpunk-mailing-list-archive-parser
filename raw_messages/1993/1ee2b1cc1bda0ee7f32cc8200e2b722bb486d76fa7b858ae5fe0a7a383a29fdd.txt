Abstract:               This manual is for C++ programmers who are
                        developing Solaris Teleservices (XTEL)
                        applications. A good understanding of the
                        UNIX(tm) operating system and the C++
                        programming language are required.  Example
                        programs are provided that illustrate the concepts
                        in the text.

                        The manual explains how to use XTEL to write
                        applications that:

                        o Place or answer multiple calls
                        o Hold, drop, conference and transfer calls
                        o Provide access to data channels
                        o Enable security and sharing of calls between
                          processes.
