	 How do STU-III phones work then?  Do they have some key in rom?

RAM, actually.  The phones are keyed for some set of individuals;
these keys are tied to ``crypto ignition keys'' possessed by these
individuals.  When you insert your key, the phone knows who you are,
and transmits a certificate containing your public key to the far
end.  Other information in the certificate includes your security
clearance, and (I think) your name.  On some models at least, the
key storage can be erased instantly by pressing a single button.
The uses for that feature are obvious...

I highly commend this paper to the cypherpunks readership:

@article{Diffie88,
   author = {Whitfield Diffie},
   journal = {Proceedings of the IEEE},
   month = {May},
   number = {5},
   pages = {560--577},
   title = {The First Ten Years of Public Key Cryptography},
   volume = {76},
   year = {1988}
}
