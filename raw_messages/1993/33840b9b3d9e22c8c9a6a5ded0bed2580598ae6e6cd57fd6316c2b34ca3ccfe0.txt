Most likely the DTE will be doing the encryption/decryption.  Who would
buy an expensive hardware encryption device when you can write terminal
software to do it?

Yeah, tapping 1200 and 2400 bps modems is prety easy to do.  Actually
you probably wouldn't even need to build filters or anything, just
record the signal and connect it to a stock 2400 modem, then set the
modem to originate or answer.  The modem already has filters to decode
the data, of course.  You have to do it twice if you want to get both
sides of the transmission tho.
