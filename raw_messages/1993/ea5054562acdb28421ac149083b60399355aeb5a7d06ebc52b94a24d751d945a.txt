In Denmark practically everybody has a 'DAN-card', a card with which all 
purchaces, no matter how small, can be charged directly to one's bank 
account. There is no charge for using or having the card, and it can be used 
practically everywhere. If for some reason you still want cash, there are 
plenty of ATMs around.

This means that the banks and the government know pretty much how much each 
of us spends on everything, but that's ok since we all trust the banks and 
the government  :-( .

When are we going to get real and untracable (!) electronic money ?
