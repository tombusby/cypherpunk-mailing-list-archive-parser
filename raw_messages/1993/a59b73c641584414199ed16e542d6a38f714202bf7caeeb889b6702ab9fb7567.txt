I symphatize for poor Mr. Habrecht being unable to get off this list.
Does it mean, that he, in his frustration bombing my mailbox, is
"justified"?  Hey, it's not me, who signed himon to this list,
it's not me, who can throw him out! So why did he choose to
shoot from the hip at innocent bystanders? By the same
logic, if one feels he was treated unjustly
anywhere - just make a bomb and blow up
the highest building in your area
with the largest amount of
people in it. What a real
responsible bastard can
do such things...

And who's talking about responsibility?!
An "e-mail terrorist"? Ha!

Can cypherpunks survive the "war"? With who? Lighten up!

Spitting saliva and terms like "petty vandals"? Well, well...
Who was that idiot, who vandalized my mailbox with his
stupid 3K lines of excrements? That's what true
"vandalism" is, in my eyes... Oh, and if you
aren't satisfied with how car service in
your city works - get a gun and hunt
their passengers... What a man...

And the last - who the hell needs that privacy? Is it
something valuable for cypherpunks only, something
you don't really need for yourself? Just joined
this list out of kindness to help those poor
kids?

Yeah. Always nice to have a peace defender...

Well, list manager, are you there? Ain't this pure truth?
And as Mark pointed out, can it be managed AUTOMATICALLY?
Somebody out there, please?

Oh no! Seeing a terrorist attack, we should seek a reason for
that poor person to act this way, to justify his doings, and
to change our behaviour, because obviously, a person with
grievance isn't responsible, or liable for his
actions - we are!   Thus we shouldn't
threaten a "mail-bomber" with
response in kind, oh no!

Give me my wish, or ye all will suffer the consequenses!

 > What phenomenal assholes you are!!!

Sounds like you were looking at the mirror too much
recently (:-).
