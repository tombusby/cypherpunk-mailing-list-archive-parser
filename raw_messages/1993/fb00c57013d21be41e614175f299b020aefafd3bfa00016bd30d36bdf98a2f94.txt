Well, I've had a lot of people asking me where to get procmail from.  I'm 
including several addreses at the end of this list.  At the momeent, I am 
testing my procmail recipes for pgp.  I suspect I have a file locking problem,
which, while it hasn't manifested itself yet, could cause problems later.  I am
working on fixing this before I release my recipes.  So that I may test my 
recipes, I would appreciate it if you would send me, first, a copy of your
public key, then a message signed with it.  Also, I would like you to try to
spoof it.  To make this easier for you, I will send you back your message as it
appears in my mailbox.  Thanx in advance.
