The second Detweiler forward in 24 hrs, but I just can't help it! This is
just too good!

I went back to alt.privacy to see the post forwarded earlier. I found that
Detweiler had posted five or six messages in a row, in reply to my kiss-off
message.

But I also found this gem:

  SCENE: Satellite of Love.  Tom Servo is polishing a glass globe that
looks just like his own head.

Crow:  Whatya doing?
Tom:   I'm just.... polishing up a fishbowl.  I thought it'd look good
          here by the hexscreen (he moves over to the hexscreen and
          places the bowl, opening up, just under the hexscreen).
          What do you think?
Crow:  I think that's silly.  First of all, there's no place to put a
          fishbowl there.  Besides which, we don't have any fish here
          to put in a bowl.

  (Mike enters from stage right)

Mike:  Are you two arguing again?

  (Light flashes to indicate an incoming call from the Mads)

Mike:  Never mind; let's see what they want this time.  (taps button)

  SCENE: Deep 13.  Dr. Forrester is holding a cheap-looking mask resembling
his own face.

Dr. F:  Hello, Matt.
Mike:   That's 'Mike'.
Dr. F:  Whatever.  Anyway, it's time for your Invention Exchange, unless
          you need more time to set it up and want me to go first--
Mike:   Well, actually no--
Dr. F:  OK, I'll go first.  Of course, a mad scientist in my position has
          his share of enemies, and some of them are a bit too tough to
          be beaten off directly.  The next best thing is misdirection:
          getting them to vent their frustrations on something more...
          what's the word... 'expendable'.  (Turns toward stage left)
          Oh, Frank!

  (Frank enters from stage left)

Dr. F:  I need you to model this (hands Frank the mask)

  (Frank puts on Dr. F mask)

Dr. F:  As you can see, the perfect decoy to cover my escape if things
          ever get too hot to handle.  And now, your turn.

  (Mike holds a telephone with several types of bells, horns, and other
noisemakers attached to it.)

Mike:   You're finished, then?
Dr. F:  That's what I just _said_.
Frank:  How long do I have to wear this?
Dr. F:  (To Frank) Until I tell you to stop!  (To Mike) Well??
Mike:   We all know about Caller ID, but it has one big problem: you don't
          see the caller's ID until you get close enough to read that little
          display window.  My invention is a Caller ID Ringer that lets
          you know whether the call is worth picking up without even having
          to get out of the bathtub.

  (Cash register bell rings)

Mike:   See, that tells you it's one of those calls from somebody asking
          you for money.

  (Bugle call of 'Reveille' sounds)

Mike:   That tells you it's an Army recruiter calling.

  (Foghorn sounds)

Mike:   That means it's your boss on the line.

  (Poofter pops out of phone, with sound)

Mike:   That means a call on the party line.

Dr. F:  Yes, yes, I'm sure you've got a million of them, but that's all
          the time we have for the Invention Exchange.  Now, for your
          experiment, I have a special treat. (grins evilly)  You remember
          L. Detweiler, alias R. Boxx, alias about a dozen other names
          I can't be bothered to keep track of?

Crow:   I have a bad feeling about this....

Dr. F:  Well, we have a rare treat: a post from him under his very own
          name (as far as we know).  Boy, are you in for some deep
          hurting this time!

  (Movie alarm goes off)

  6....5....4....3....2....1....G

(Mike and Crow exit hastily, Mike carrying Tom)


  SCENE: Satellite of Love.  Mike places Tom on a table and begins
looking around frantically.

Mike:  Crow!  Quick!  Help me find a spare head for Tom Servo!  We don't
          have much time!
Crow:  (exits stage left)

  (A second Tom Servo enters from stage right)

Mike:  Tom Servo!  Quick!  Help me find a spare head for Tom Servo!

  (Mike stops and does a double-take)

Mike:  What?!?  But you're there (points to Tom Servo on table) with your
          head blown apart from illogic overload or something....
Tom:   (chuckles)  Oh, that!  That's just one of the alter egos I use
          when I need a break from the Mads' experiments.

  (Light flashes to indicate an incoming call from the Mads)

Tom:   Quick!  Get that out of here!  I don't want them to find out....

  (Mike pushes the remains of the other Tom Servo out of sight under the
table.)

  SCENE: Deep 13.  Frank is still wearing the Dr. Forrester mask.  Dr. F
is wearing an equally cheesy-looking Frank mask.

Frank: Well?

Mike:  Frank?  Are you still wearing that silly mask?

  (Dr. F rips off his own mask, then Frank's.  Frank clutches his nose,
which was pinched by Dr. F's grab).

Dr. F: Oh, stop whining and push the button!

  (Frank keeps both hands on his nose and fumbles for the button with his
elbows, hitting it after several tries).
