     So this doesn't seem possible to you, does it?  10 years to me seems
more than enough time to design the code and implement it in key places
like USENET and mailing lists.  10 years AGO we were happy to have the
tiny 5 1/4" floppy disk as opposed to the 8".  Now we have flopptical and
WORM..  Perhaps the world of mainframes moves slower than the rest of the
world.. but that doesn't matter because in 10 years the many PCs will be on
the internet with ISDN with plenty of free cycles to maintain [or consult] a
database of positive reputations.

     It's not a way to RUN a society... it just happens.

     Isn't that what we have now?  If the DEA busted down your door could
you defend yourself?  If NSA wants to waste more of your money do they ask
you?  Because we have rules I think people are misled into thinking it's
fair.  Society will ALWAYS be a "might makes right" way of life.. the
"might" is not necissarily physical power but it's still might.  TTFN.
