I have a better idea. You generate your D (dangerous) file and encrypt
it with IDEA or DES and a secret key K that you commit to memory. You then
destroy D. If (encrypt(D,K)) is seized and you are ordered to decrypt it,
then you produce a file F such that (F XOR encrypt(D,K)) produces whatever
bogus plaintext you desire and hand F over to the cops claiming that it's
your one-time pad.

Much simpler, and no chance of them discovering your plaintext, although
there's no guarantee that they won't suspect that you're still hiding
something (especially if they read cypherpunks).
