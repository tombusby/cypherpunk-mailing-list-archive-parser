I just thought I should add that I agree with the last poster.  Cryptography
will be increasingly hard to learn in the future, if this kind of thing goes on.
But it will be ten or fifteen years before anyone has computers which can
crack an 128-bit version of DES.  I am cryptologically naive, but I think 
that people can always find privacy when they want it.  An underground
cypherpunk movement may be the only way to bring up new cryptographers.

More important is the issue of equipment.  Is a computer communications
equipment?  If so, we might have clipper chips on our motherboards.  Reading
input from the keyboard.

This is a crisis for privacy.  Can someone, preferably the people who run 
the cypherpunk list, set up a Privacy Advertising Fund?  I would be willing to
donate money, and hopefully many other cypherpunks would too.  We might win
that way.  Urge people to protest with full-page ads in newspapers.  With 30-
second TV spots.  With demonstrations.

I will donate, if it is formed, but I can not form it except under the most
extreme conditions.  I have no experience in advertising or management.

Be afraid.  Be very afraid.
