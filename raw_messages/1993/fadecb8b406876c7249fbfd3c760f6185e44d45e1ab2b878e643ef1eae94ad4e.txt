Please stop sending the Cypherpunks mailing list to

   edgar@spectrx.saigon.com (Edgar W. Swank)

until further notice.  I anticipate rejoining the list soon after
my wife and I return from travel abroad around the end of June.
(Since I'm retired I guess I can't say "vacation" or "holiday", can
I?)

For the general list:

I would greatly appreciate it if someONE would save to E-mail me after
my return any postings here or to alt.security.pgp about the progress
of the USA-Legal PGP project or availability, or any response by Jim
Bidzos or RSA to Phil Z's letter of early this month, asking
permission to use non-standard RSAREF entry points.
