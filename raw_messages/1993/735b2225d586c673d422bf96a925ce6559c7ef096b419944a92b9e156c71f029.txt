How do you explain your statements I analyzed in RISKS 15.27, where you
posted to cypherpunks promoting your sophisticated pseudospoofing techniques? 
Multiple posting sites, countermeasures and contempt for `opponents' who 
attempt to determine whether your tentacles are who they claim to be.

Frankly, I think you are a baldfaced liar. Are you intellectually challenged
or am I going to have to go root up all the archives to prove it?

You cryptoanarchists are so arrogant. it will be your downfall.

hee, hee, once P.Metzger complained in his typical searing flame fashion
on the cpunk list that the word `cypherpunk' was just too darn subversive
sounding. Mr. Metzger is another classic cryptoanarchist. Hey Perry, could
you send me another mailbomb for tweaking your nose?

let the record show I am in no way agreeing with S.Sternlight <g>

people interested in civilizing cyberspace and repressing the cryptoanarchist
scum should send `subscribe cypherwonks' to majordomo@lists.eunet.fi.
Electronic Democracy is on it's way!

and the cryptoanarchists like you will call them `pigs' and resent them
for promoting law and order where you previously had your delightful
lawless anarchy.

I dunno, but I hope she cracks down on the cryptoanarchist terrorists like
you.

yes, the cryptoanarchists will be quite at home when it is possible and
rampant. The Cyberspatial Mafia. complete with corruption, bribery, and
hit men.

: Review," etc. An interesting bunch of folks.)

Warning: join the cypherpunks only if you are interested in cryptoanarchist
brainwashing from multiple fake identities, many of them from the leaders
themselves. `An interesting bunch of folks'. Hee, hee. more like 
cryptoanarchists and cyberspatial terrorists and guerillas, masters
of subterfuge and sabotage, gaining increasing respectability and influence
every day. You guys own a congressman yet?

: No, the Data Highway won't likely tolerate "sealed loads" that might
: be accessing offshore gambling dens, kiddie porn rings, or weapons

Poor timmy and your cryptoanarchists, what are you going to do, given that
your favorite black uses are barred and illegal?

: rules and regulations for "fair access," for the allowable data
: packets that can travel on it, and for taxation of the explosion in
: commercial traffic which will inevitably come.
: Hence, the Data Highway Patrol.
: Or maybe they'll call it the "CyberSpace Patrol."

who will prevent people like you from building up arsenals of fake identities
to deceive others. 

: Personally, I hate government programs. I don't want the government

poor timmy and his cryptoanarchists don't understand the world they live in.
they are outcasts and misfits who think that all forms of Government and
even Democracy are Orwellian oppressions. they will criticize any system
that attempts to put together secure email, that prevents forgery at the 
protocol level, as Orwellian.
