I just finished upgrading from PGP v2.2 to v2.3a (and without a
hitch, I might add). This may sound like a silly question, but
how do you add an AKA to your key? I skimmed through the
manual, as usual, to ensure that I didn't absent-mindedly overlook
something, but didn't see this mentioned. I have, however, seen it
done and have a couple on my keyring in fact.
 
 
Something along the <pgp -kva ferg> lines of:

1 key(s) examined.
 
 
Danke.
