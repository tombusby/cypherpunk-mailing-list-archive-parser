Nope, that's not it.  If you can accuse a BBS sysop of a feloney, YOU CAN 
SIEZE HIS DAMN COMPUER!!!!!!  And guess who gets the money from the sale of
the (expensive) computer equipment....the LEA who "made the bust."  Oh ya, and 
you come out smelling like a rose in ink too.  Not a bad proposition for some
District Attorney who wants to make a name for himself, hypotheticly speaking.

Most laymen don't even understand what email is.  So, "obviously those computer
users are doing something illegal," so the thinking goes.  And when the 
"authorities" say [insert your favorite subversive action], the average person
believes it.

That scares the Hell out of em, I'm sure.  BTW, am I going to have to compile
Cryptographic Work Bench, or is this crypt trivial and I'm too tired to see it?

I'm not even going to touch this one....
