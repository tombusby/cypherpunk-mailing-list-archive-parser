It's always a dangerous strategy to recognize your opponent has a
legitimate position.  If they dismissed our concerns with hand-waving
they could also defuse Congressional (or other) inquiries with an appeal
to authority; but with these documents they've acknowledged the
legitimacy of our concerns.

You mean they _wouldn't_?  Refusal to provide all documents and the
dates of these documents (i.e., not during the initial design stages)
suggests that they could well be covers for other documents.

If nothing else, I would like to see correspondence at the same level
from a year ago, back when it appeared Bush was a shoo-in for reelection.
I suspect we will find a substantially different tone....

I don't think we have _any_ information about the *original* intent.
We have some indications of what they intended after Clinton was
elected, but none of these documents are from the Bush era.

Why not accept this at face value -- the government asked AT&T how
many phones they would need to purchase to make it worthwhile for
AT&T to make the things, AT&T gave them a number, and the government
said "Okay!"

I read this as "National security officials will have access to the keys,
but this will not be revealed to the public."

Nothing I hadn't already assumed.  :-(

No, "narcotraffickers" are the people who bring the drugs into the 
country.  Apparently the Feds have decided to leave persecution of
alleged drug dealers (note tenses) to local authorities using
forfeiture laws, while the Feds concentrate on the people bringing
the drugs into the country and the major distribution networks.

More likely the tendency of people to pretend "this can't happen to
me!"  After all, most people only deal with other residents of North
America and there are no internal cryptographic restrictions.  Yet.
