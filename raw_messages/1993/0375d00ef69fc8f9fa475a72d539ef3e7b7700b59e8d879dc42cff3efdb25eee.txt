I'm very sorry to see you go.  I certainly agree that the list has been
annoying of late, but I disagree that cpunx is a controlled environment,
nor should it be.  I believe that leaving is no solution, but making
heart-felt comments and contributions on one hand and ignoring and
kill-filing obnoxious posters on the other hand is IMHO the most direct
path to a future we are comfortable in.

Again, I'm sorry to see you go.  It feels like a victory for the dark side.
