I'm still confused, only in a different way.  Let's let I want to withdraw  
$10,000...


1) I send the bank a signed request to withdraw 10,000 dollars

2) The bank withdraws the money but doesn't sends it to me.

I go to the arbitrator and say: "The bank cheated me!!"

The bank says: "We sent you the money.  Here is your withdraw request, signed  
by you.  You are lying."

------

How can I prove that the bank did not send me the money?  


The withdraw protocol must somehow produce a receipt, signed by *me*, saying I  
receiving the money.  If the bank cannot present such a receipt, then the  
arbitrator shouldn't believe that the bank really sent the money.

Yet why would I sign a receipt before verifying that the bits the bank sent me  
was a valid chunk of digital money?  Does this mean the bank sends me valid  
digital money first and I reply with a signed receipt?

If so, what if I claim that the transmition failed and I didn't receive the  
money, but I really *did* get the money?  I could then tell the bank that I  
changed my mind and I want them to rollback the withdraw transaction?  I would  
walk off with a valid chuck of digital money, yet my account was not  
decremented.

Obviously I'm still missing something.
