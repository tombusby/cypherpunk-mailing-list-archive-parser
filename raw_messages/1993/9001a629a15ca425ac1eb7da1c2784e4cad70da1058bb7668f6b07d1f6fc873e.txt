After using pgp to read an encrypted message, I ran chkdsk on my hard drive.  I
was astonished to find that chkdsk found an error on my hard drive, but I was
even more astonished to find that when I recovered the error to a file, it 
contained most of a message I had just read using pgp.  Apearantly, this was
what was left of a temp file that pgp used.  IMHO, pgp should have wiped this
file.  Maybe I should try to use a ramdisk as my temp-file path.  Just thought
ya'll should know that pgp may not be as secure as we hope.

In my effort to write a menu system for pgp-encrypted email, I use pgp very 
often, and in very unusuall ways.  Consequently, I have found a (very) few 
weaknesses in the program.  Is anyone currently supporting pgp, or am I on my
own?  If anyone is supporting pgp, I'd like to talk to you. ;^)  Thanx in 
advance.
