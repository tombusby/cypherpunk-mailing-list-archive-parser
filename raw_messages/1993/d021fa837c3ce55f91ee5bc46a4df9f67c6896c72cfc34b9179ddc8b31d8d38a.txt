Perry, I'm absolutely stunned.  What next: should we all make sure we shave
every day (women: don't forget those legs and armpits!)?  Or make tcmay remove
the word "anarchy" and other ungood words from his .sig?  Anyone who feels
like talking to the press or lobbying her representatives (and I'm not
claiming that those tactics are either good or bad) can wear a suit, makeup,
a respectable haircut, or whatever--that's their decision.  I can understand
the need to confront this issue as a large and united group, and I suspect that
other groups like the EFF, CPSR, etc., are better for that purpose anyway.  You
don't need to mention that you're a "cypherpunk" when dealing with media or
government officials if you think that'll diminish your credibility or legitimacy.

It's easy to be idealistic when things are good.  At the _very first hint_ of trouble,
we shouldn't immediately cower and go straight (this may seem like an exaggeration,
but the name-change proposal strikes me as a dangerous first step).  Shit, we're not
even doing anything _illegal_.  Relax.

Love and Kisses,

   --Dave.
