EFF will be well-represented at ONE BBSCon.  Mike Godwin, Cliff Figallo,
Sarah Simpson (our new membership coordinator) and I will be there speaking
and coordinating an EFF booth, which will boast all sorts of documentation,
floppies, and, yes, you asked for it, t-shirts (new design)!  We will
certainly have some Clipper stuff.

Yeah, yeah, I know.  It was really strange for me to be looked at as
supporting the government over individuals!  Maybe we can continue the
debate this year.  See you in a week!  :)
