Ok, here's a summary of replies regarding sorting of mail by To: fields,
or more in general, grouping all list mail together by mailing list.
Thanx to all who responded. As you can see, there are a variety of ways
to approach this problem.
All of these replys were posted to Cypherpunks already, so re-posting
is kosher.

I've cut out the extra header stuff and the PGP signatures, and edited
the messages for brevity.

     I use the following .forward file to make slocal "sort" my mail based
upon the contents of the .maildelivery file below.

-- $HOME/.forward --
| /usr/lib/mh/slocal -user nowhere
<EOF>

     You should use something like the following .maildelivery file to
tell slocal where to put the messages.

-- $HOME/.maildelivery --
#
# field "pattern" action "command"
#
To "cypherpunks@toad.com" file ? Mail/cypherpunks

     This will file messages directed to cypherpunks to a file in your
Elm mail directory, but leave all other messages untouched.  You have
to then choose the folder "=cypherpunks" to read those messages.

     NOTE:  You need to change the path of slocal to the appropriate
path for your system.  You can find it with the whereis -b command or
the find utility.  Am I forgetting anything?

Erm, only that this apparently appears to pretty much _require_ switching
mailreaders to MH.  A more transparent solution can be achieved with the
'procmail' package, available from any comp.sources.misc archive.  This
package allows rule-based filtering on message content, size, and other
factors, and can be installed workably with most mailreaders to my
knowledge, without requiring much effort.

From wimsey.bc.ca!markh@wimsey.com Thu Mar 18 13:: Cypher: Subject naming propos
al

There's a program called "filter" (which I think is part of the elm
distribution) that I use to automatically route messages from different
mailing lists to separate folders, which can then be read at leisure.
Very handy!

mush will also allow filtering based on more or less whatever
you want (e.g. To: fields).
