From dmandl@lehman.com:

It is indeed working OK now.  Encryption is not required.  Good to see this
remailer back up, especially because it introduces a long delay, making traffic
analysis more difficult.  FYI, sending a message to myself (in NYC) through
this remailer, it took about 15 hours for it to come back.  This is either very
good or very bad depending on your purposes.  Bad for urgent messages, good for
more...er...sensitive applications.
