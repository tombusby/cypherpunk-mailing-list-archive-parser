And I should've enclosed it in #ifdef STUPID ... #endif.  I misread
the putenv(3) man page and didn't realize that you could just use 

	putenv("PGPPATH=");
	putenv("PGPPASS=");

To wipe those variables out of your environment...  They still might
get caught by a 'ps -eaxuww' but chances are slim.  Is it posible to
alter your arguments so they're not visible to 'ps -auxww'?

Well as a matter of fact, it does seems to work on my sparcstation:

        main (int argn, char **argv, char **envv)
        {
            system("ps -uww");
        
            for (;*argv;++argv) {
                while (**argv) {
                    *(*argv)++ = ' ';
                } /* end of while */
            } /* end of for */
        
            puts("--------------------------------");
            system("ps -uww");
        }

Not elegant, but that's what makes it a GLP (grungy little program).

So, is there a more elegant way to do this?  How portable is it?
Finally, of how much use is it?
