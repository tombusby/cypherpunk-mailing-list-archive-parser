        The ALBERT J. NOCK FORUM and Southern California 
Supper Club is another club that may be of interest to you, 
run by the host of the H. L. Mencken Forum. Albert J. Nock 
wrote essays (An Anarchist's Progress) and books about 
government like Our Enemy, The State and Mr. Jefferson. 

        The Nock Forum has been in operation for over 10 
years, hosting speakers on engineering, scientific, financial, 
and political issues. Controversial figures, on and over the 
cutting edge of toleration and civil liberties, have also 
graced the forum, but nobody more outrageous than you'll see 
on a given day's Geraldo, Oprah, Donahue, or Montel Williams 
show. I DON'T remember a speaker having had a sex change from 
male to female, then discovering she was a lesbian, but I was 
in Northern California for a while and may have missed it.

Past speakers at Mencken and Nock include: Max More (Extropy), 
LiberTech's Chuck Hammill, Wendy McElroy (Freedom, Feminism, 
and the State), David Justin Ross (Calera), J. Neil Schulman 
(author of Alongside Night and Rainbow Cadenza), Vic Koman 
(Jehovah Contract), Robert Anton Wilson (Illuminatus!, Natural 
Law), L. Neil Smith (Confederacy SF novels), Dr. Sharon Presley
(Libertarian Psychology - Obedience to Authority), Samuel 
Edward Konkin III (New Libertarian, Agorist Institute), 
Brock Meeks (Computer Privacy), Burt Rutan (Voyager, FreeWing),
Paul Macready (Gossamer Condor and Albatross) and many others 
on topics like nanotechnology, public key crypto, artificial 
intelligence, immortality, informal markets and other topics 
that look like Tim May's tag line. BTW, Tim has a standing 
invitation from the host to speak about "Crypto Anarchy" and 
get a free dinner (He's gotta be in town and schedule ahead). 
        
        The latest speaker was Richard Grant, author 
(Incredible Bread Machine, Trashing Nuclear Power, Rent 
Control and the War against the Poor), on "Bring Us The Head 
of Michael Milken." 

Date/time/location of the next ALBERT J. NOCK Forum,

STEVEN W. MOSHER "The Future of 1/4 of the Human Race."
ACAPULCO at Cerritos Plaza 1800 West Whittier Blvd.,
