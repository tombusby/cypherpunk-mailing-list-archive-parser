I've finally figured out your intense loyalty, sensitivity, and
secrecy. You're homosexual lovers.

Quite a complex and secretive culture, these cypherpunks.

I really do wonder what magic the Wizards have truly practiced.

Look, if you don't want to tell me, just say so. But could you tell me
when you are going to `come out of the closet'? I mean, everyone is
going to find out some day, right? Could you at least tell me when the
Big Day is? I'm really dying of anticipation.
