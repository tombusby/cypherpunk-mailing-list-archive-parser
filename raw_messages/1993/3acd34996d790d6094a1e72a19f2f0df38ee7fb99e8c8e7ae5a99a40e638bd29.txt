Well there won't be a complete movement in that direction.
The set up of the list may differ. Some lists may be open to all to
read but open only to subscribers to post. Some lists may be the
other way around. (Can't think of an example, but there may be one
out there.) By the way, I've never really seen too many abusive
postings on the Usenet groups I frequent.It doesn't seem to be a
problem. Just my opinion.

Again, there will always be the fun of watching people flame.
