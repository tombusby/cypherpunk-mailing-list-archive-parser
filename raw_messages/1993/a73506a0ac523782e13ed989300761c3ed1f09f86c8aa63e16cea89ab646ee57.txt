  I have just finished writing a fancy new package for GNU Emacs
(pgpmail).  It requires PGP, RMAIL, and sendmail.  You must be able to
run a program from within Emacs.  Pgpmail automaticaly checks message
signatures and decrypts messages, it helps automate signing outgoing
messages (and strips the signatures a bit too!).  Pgpmail also helps
fix a known security hole -- it doesn't send you passphrase on the
command line, but uses the environment instead.

  If you would like to be an early alpha tester for my software, *and*
feel you would provide lots of testing please reply to me directly.
