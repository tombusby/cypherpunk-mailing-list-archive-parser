If the Cypherpunks schedule their January '94 meeting on the 2nd
Saturday, Jan 8, that will conflict with a party announced
by visiting Exi fireman Harry (Hawk) Shapiro. Harry said:

    As I announced a month or so ago, I am holding a party on Jan 8,
    at the Shearaton Palace Hotel in San Fran.

    Jan 8th is the last day of MacWorld.  Hopefully a group of us will
    meet for dinner arround 6pm.  The party will start about 8 or
    8:30.

As I doubt either Harry or MacWorld will change their schedules for
our benefit, I suggest the Cypherpunks consider (and announce with
plenty of lead time) changing theirs to the Saturday after (Jan 15)
(The Saturday before is New Year's day).
