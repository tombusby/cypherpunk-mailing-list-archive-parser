I think you have convinced me.  I don't want to be convinced, so maybe I
will try again later, when I have learned more about it. ;-)

This means to me, that you cannot patent a broad claim, until you have a
narrow specific example of it.  Anti-gravity had prior art, public key
systems did not.  If without inventing a public key system, someone had
described the concept in general terms, then prior art would exist for
this as well.  The person who invented the wheel (or sled?) might have
been able to have claims broad enough to cover hovercrafts.

At what expense?  Will our government win some battles, it might otherwise
lose to the cypherpunks?  Would legal access to pgp, now, be a deciding
factor to maintaining legal access to non-clipper encryption later?
