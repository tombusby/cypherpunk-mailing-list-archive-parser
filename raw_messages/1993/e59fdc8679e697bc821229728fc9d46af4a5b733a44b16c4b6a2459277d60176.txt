1]  I didn't see that the writer said anything about Libertarians.
2]  I didn't get the impression that the writer was specifically calling
    for the violent overthrow of the government, only that he/she
    believed that actual violence _might_ eventually come.

Of course, I cannot personally say with any accuracy, but I feel
strongly that a private ("underground," if you prefer) network of those
discussing radical options must exist as a direct result of more secure
communication.  I have no evidence of this, but it seems like such an
obvious and irresistable consequence that I can't picture it NOT
happening, especially considering the numbers of pissed-off people using
computer networks these days.

1]  I didn't get the impression that the writer was saying that
    Cypherpunks were part of any such conspiracy, if it even exists, but
    only that Cypherpunks tech aided their communications.
2]  I have also never been clear on how formal an organization
    Cypherpunks actually are - if they actually have a platform or a
    membership roster or secret handshakes or have turned the word
    "Cypherpunks" into a registered trademark with marketing licensed
    for logoed adjustable size baseball caps and childrens' lunchbox
    sets.  Is there sufficient officialness for the result of a nut with
    "CYPHERPUNKS!" on his chest in Magic Marker biting off Hillary
    Roddam's left thumb at a press conference to be the forfeiture of
    Tim May's personal fortune under RICO?  I wonder.

Certainly true enough, but who claims to "speak" for cypherpunks anyway?

Hell, yes.  If I were signing my name to stuff, I'd be as benightedly
pro-Statist in my posts as David Sternlight himself.
