From the book jacket - 
"A vital instrument of power, telecommunications
is and always has been a profoundly political technology. In "The
Invisible Weapon," Headrick examines the political history of
telecommunications from the mid-nineteenth century to the end of world
war II, and illustrates how this technology gave nations a new
instrument for international relations.

Headrick's discusses the political aspects of information technology in
modern history. He shows how telegraphy created conflicts in far-flung
empires which hastened the deterioration of diplomacy on the brink
of the first world war; increased the political interest in controlling
news; and how the security of telecommunications made communications
strategy, communications intelligence, and cryptography decisive tools
during the two world wars."

This book is of interest to be because it details all of the positive
accepts of why a government "needs" to know everything that is
telecommunicated everywhere it can. Even more importantly is shows how
the British government routinely intercepted communications sent through
British owned telecommunications infrastructure despite publicly
claiming they would never do such a thing.

It also shows how interception "hastened the deterioration of
diplomacy."
