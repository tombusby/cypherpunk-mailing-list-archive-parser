I don't know about soda, but I have been mirroring it here at aql.gatech.edu
and would love to put them up for ftp. I have /pub/cypherpunks/Incoming
set up for dropoffs. Put them in and I should have them up within a day for
anonymous ftp. Drop me a note also when you drop them off for quicker 
response. What did the [images available] besides the patent number mean?

Look forward to hearing from you.
