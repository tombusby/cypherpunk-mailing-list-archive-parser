These are very good points.  After I get this whole thing put together, I may
have an introductory special.... ;^)

And you would be force to trust him, also...and anyone else I may farm this out
to.  Not this kid. ;^)

I was thinking of issuing a signed certificate to the customer indicating 
exactly why I signed his key.  This could be presented to other people who 
question my signature.  As per my policy, which can be gotten via finger, I will
sign a key iff any of the following is true:

1. I watched him generate his key.
2. I know the person by sight, and can verify his key.
3. He proves, with picture id, in person, that the public key is his.
4. He sends me a photocopy of his picture id and a signed statement   
     containing the pgp footprint of his key.
5. His key is signed by someone whom I trust to sign keys.

Note that #5 implies that the other signer has the same policy.  My policy will
be stated in my certificate.  Comments?
