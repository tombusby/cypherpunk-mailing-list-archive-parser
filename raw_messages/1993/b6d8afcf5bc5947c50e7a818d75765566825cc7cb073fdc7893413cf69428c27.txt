A minor correction to my post:

"...this stuff have access to the CRYPTO Proceedings at large university
libraries, and the Fiat-Shamir paper is definitely a nice little
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      
intro, so I'm not sure it's worth the couple of hours it may take to
get a good clean copy suitable for uploading to the list."

I left out a "not, " which alters the meaning. What I meant to say is
that the Fiat-Shamir paper is definitely *not* a nice little inro.
It's an academic paperr, not a primer on is-a-person credentialling.

Few primers on advanced cryptology exist, as I'm sure you've all
noticed. I'll be interested to see Bruce Schneier's new book,
"Practical Cryptography," to see if it covers any of these newer ideas.
