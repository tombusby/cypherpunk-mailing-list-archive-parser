Oh, come off it.  Your rants under various names (including your own)
are very similar: in tone and style, in topic, in their universal
fixation on PSEUDOSPOOFING, "top cypherpunks", and "cypherpunk
leaders", in time of night sent to the list, in 0 of
punctuation.  Then we have an12070 quoting from private mail to you --
you tried to weasel by saying you'd "communicated with your
colleague", whom you're now calling a "paranoid ranter".  And just
today you made a blatant foul-up in your rant on drug conspiracies:

Oops.  I find it ironic that for all your rants about PSEUDOSPOOFING,
your practices are the most blatant and long-running example I have
ever encountered.  I would not count your an12070 account as more
than one identity, except that you constantly change the name and
use different ones to contradict others:

Enough.

You may recall that your very first paranoid claim was that Tim May
and Jamie Dinkelacker were the same person.  You were given the phone
numbers of both -- this was before people became nervous about giving
you any personal information.  Did you ever attempt a reality check?

It's not an answer because he didn't ADMIT to his heinous CRIMES, I
guess.  Rot in place, will you?
