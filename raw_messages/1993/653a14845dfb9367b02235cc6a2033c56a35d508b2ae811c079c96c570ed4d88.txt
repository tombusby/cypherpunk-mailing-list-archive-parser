Note that while we are technically 'open for business', we are the first
ones to admit we have a ways to go before we are 100% ready for prime
time.

This will change as better tools emerge. This is the plan.

The interest is considerably more than vague; we're hesitant to commit
to it or hype it while we're sorting out more fundamental issues.

We will (obvoiusly) be working very closely with the attempt to set up
the Digital Credit Unions, and will (obviously) be one of the first 
vendors to be able to process electronic checks written in the MOO etc.
Certainly various kinds of anonymous 'tokens' will be available as well, 
which could become a medium of exchange (although it is unclear at 
present whether these will be redeemable for cash).

Most of these things have been in the plan from the beginning; things
will be announced as they happen, and hopefully not too much before.
