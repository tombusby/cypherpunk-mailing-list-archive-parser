Well, I've done some comparison between gmp 1.3 and RSAREF (as distributed
with RIPEM 1.07) on a RS6000/320

The key generation speeds turned out to be almost exactly the same using
the "aixgcc/xlc mixed" version of RSAREF/RIPEM and gmp compiled entirely
with IBM's xlc compiler.

(for those who haven't poked around in RIPEM, I'll say that this RS6000
version of RIPEM uses the "long long" data type to get 32 bit by 32 bit
multiplications with 64 bit results quickly).

So, it wouldn't surprise me if some clever person could optimize
gmp for the RS6000 and end up with something faster than what's
provided in RIPEM 1.07.
