Subject: RE: META: Filter Detweiler

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I have to "strongly disagree" with Hal's suggestion that we source filter 
LD or anyone else. While I am as sick of him as the rest, I think
that Sandy's Pledge is a much better idea. I've been observing my own 
version of the Pledge for about a month. 

I even thought about ignoring Hal's post. But it suggests something that is 
contrary to the fundamental ideas that I believe in: we should be using
technology to improve privacy and our personal freedom. This starts
with freedom of speach.

The obvious solution is for each person to put LD, SBoxx, etc. in their
own kill file. If your mail client doesn't support a kill file, you can
always use the "d" command. Or find a client that supports kill files.
Or even write some code!

For folks that are paying good money to retreive trash messages that are
simply going to be deleted, I suggest you look for an alternative service.
There are many flat-rate services. Netcom is one, and I use it instead of 
the "free" services that GMU provides for all students. Send mail to
"info_deli_server@netcom.com" with the body "get PDIAL" to get a list of
servers accross the country and some international providers as well.

The root of this thread was a complete copy of a posting that I made to
the list, and mailed to L.Detweiler.  Is "The Executioner" on the list,
if not, this is a lot of evidence that he is L.Detweiler.

BTW, this really pissed me off.  He, The Executioner, could not even
come up with his/her own post, they just cut and pasted mine.
