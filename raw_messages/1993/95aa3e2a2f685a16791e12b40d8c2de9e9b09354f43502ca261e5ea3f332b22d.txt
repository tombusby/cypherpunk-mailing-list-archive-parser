This "libertarian" (note small "l"--if you mean "Libertarian," you should
be more careful in the future) doesn't "applaud" Mr. S's firing.  What a
stupid thing to say.  You should either be fried by your more humane
Libertarian colleagues, or (if there is general agreement with your message),
you should be declared the Missing Link that some of us have been searching
for for years.  This is so typical.  If the State had pulled something like
this, you'd be screaming your head off, but when a "private" corporation does
it, you not only don't protest, but actually cheer them on?  This is just the
kind of rigid, stupid, pro-authoritarian thinking that many people expect from
the more zomboid Libs, though we rarely get to see anyone display it so
candidly.

Looking at your email address, I notice that you're an employee of mine.  I
strongly disapprove of your using this ID for your own leisure activities.
However, I'm a nice guy, so I'll give you, oh, two more chances.  Then, you're
out of here.

Direct all flames anywhere but dmandl@panix.com or dmandl@lehman.com.
