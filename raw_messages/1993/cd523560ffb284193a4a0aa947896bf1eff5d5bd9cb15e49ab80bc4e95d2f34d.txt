If I understand Karl right, he got this cascade of aliases because he
tried to talk to HIMSELF through different accounts/aliases at alternate
ends of the chain. Since no one would want to do that (other than to
test things) normally, this wouldn't be a problem.

But I already *do* control the order of use for MY mail, that means
stuff I send out and stuff people send to me in DIRECT reply to my
stuff. There is nothing to stop someone from sending to my id on pax say
through a first remailer of their own choice, provided they originate
the mail (i.e. a REPLY is not equivalent to ORIGINAL mail in this case).

As for picking my own alias, this sounds appealing but is actually much
weaker then a randomly assigned one. Besides that, it could be an
administrative nightmare for the sysadmins on the aliasing systems.
