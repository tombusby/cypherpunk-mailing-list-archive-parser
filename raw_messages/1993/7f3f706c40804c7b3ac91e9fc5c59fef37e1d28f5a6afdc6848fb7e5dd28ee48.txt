One could also imagine a 'symantic scrambler' analogous to the word 
analysis program, but designed to defeat it, by randomly altering the 
syntax of a post. The output might have to be tweaked afterwards, in 
order to restore some sense to it, but it would be a sort of ascii 
version of the cutting the words out of magazines style of ransom note.

It might just be a huge lookup table of canned phrases that get swapped 
in to replace your 'unique,' identifiable sentences. It seems like a 
dedicated global search and replace, combined with some sort of die throw 
to dictate sentence structure might be enough to screw up word analysis, 
actually...

Actually, the scrambler wouldn't have to be random--it could always 
produce output with the same word analysis signature. As long as a bunch 
of people were using it, or had access to it, you'd have deniability.
