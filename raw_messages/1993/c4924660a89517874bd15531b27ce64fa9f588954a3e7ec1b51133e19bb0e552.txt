There is little I less enjoy seeing than the spectacle of someone who has
never actually bothered to find out what the Bill of Rights says and what
it means blathering about "free speech".

Mr. Wilson: does my right to free speech entitle me to come into your
living room and demand that you provide me with a podium and a megaphone in
furtherance of my expressing my opinion?

If you think it doesn't, then you have no cause for complaint.  If, on the
other hand, you think it _does_, then I've done you a grave misservice by
mistaking you for nothing more than an uninformed chowderhead.  You would
constitute, at the very least, a full-blown loon.

That's low.  Or, to be more precise, on a par with the rest of your little
screed.
