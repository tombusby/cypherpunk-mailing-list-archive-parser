I know that I do not appreciate knowing this and it is difficult to believe 
that you would actually waste your time by digging up information to make 
someone's life difficult (even if he does keep the list noise level up). Use 
the delete key or kill file. If you really succeed in annoying him enough, 
I hope for your sake you have few leaders as to where you reside and that you 
live far away. Gestapo tactics such as these, used by certain governments, 
are what we seek to eliminate in the digital world. Why would you seek to 
implement on the list that which we (at least some of us) are trying to 
eliminate from the net? It's crap that can be done without. Direct your 
efforts more profitably.
