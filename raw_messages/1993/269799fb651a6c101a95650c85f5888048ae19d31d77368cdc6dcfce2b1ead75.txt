I pulled this off of nexis. Please note the line I highlighted.

Does anyone know what kind of encryption is being used?

At even $100 per month, we could set up also sorts of remailers
all over the country. We could even create a secure comm. via
PGP (for voice) via IP, etc.

But I wonder if the encryption "they" are using would interfer
with such schemes?

said. "Cable companies are used to supplying entertainment.  If their
network goes down for a day, wesame cable system to provide their
data, essentially their livelihood in the case of business users,
well, there's going to have to be much better understanding of how to
provide some guarantees of service."  Price for service in homes is to
be $ 75-$ 100 per month at start, but is expected to drop rapidly as
economies of scale grow.
