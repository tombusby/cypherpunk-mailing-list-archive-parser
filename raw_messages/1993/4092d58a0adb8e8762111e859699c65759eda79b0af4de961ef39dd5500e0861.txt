Responding to Tom DeBoni's message concerning whether or not
government officials should have a right to secure communications.

Agreed!

I agree with Dave Deltorto's idea about "a body that decided on a case
by case (or a class by class) basis what accounts would be subject to
heavy scrutiny".  Or perhaps limiting certain public servants (the
chief executive, Oliver North's successor, etc) to a set of 
"open" computing systems and communication paths.  (Similar to limiting
people with security clearances to sets of closed computing systems, 
communication paths.)

Unwieldy?  Kafka-esque?  Expensive?  Possibly, but it doesn't have to
be that way.  As Bongo says:  "The price of freedom is eternal
vigilance."  How much do you want to pay?
