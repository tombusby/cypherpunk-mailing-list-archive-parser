Hal Finney writes and asks what folks think about his remailers - if two are
better than one, etc.

My two cents' worth is that two is better; already we're starting to see 
applications (like the UT mail-to-news gateway) where people are filtering 
known remailers out. The bigger the list of remailers which might be sending 
mail, the harder it'll be to do that sort of thing. I wonder how big the 
list would need to get before sysadmins would consider it more economical to 
abandon filtering entirely?

Let a thousand flowers bloom.
