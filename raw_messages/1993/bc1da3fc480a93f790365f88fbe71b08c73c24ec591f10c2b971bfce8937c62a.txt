     Mathematicians at Cambridge University announced today that they have
     discovered a new whole number between 27 and 28.  "We don't know much
     about its properties", said a spokesman, "but it is causing lots of
     bother in equations.  However, we do know that it's divisible by 6 -
     but only once".
