This reveals a minor and probably obvious weakness of pseudonyms--writing
styles.

As I was reading this post from apparent newcomer "Tiia Roth-Biester," and
wondering at how a woman (I think Tiia is a woman's name) got interested in
this list, I said to myself: "Wait a minute, this sounds exactly like
Duncan Frissell!" 

Sure enough, Duncan wrote it.

Imagine what can be done with word and phrase frequency analysis, with
examination of punctuation styles (e.g., some people use _this_ for
emphasis while others use *this*), and so on. Entropy measures, etc.

Someday this may be important.
