Like that, George?

You know folks, George is right.  It isn't necessary, however, to
re-invent the wheel.  Literary conventions for text presentation
have existed for decades--if not centuries.  "NetSpeak" can be oh
so clever, but often, it's not very conducive to communication.
Almost everyone on this list took English in school (-especially-
those NOT educated in the US).  If you don't remember your
English grammar, spelling or style; buy some books.  (Or as we
say in NetSpeak, "RTFM"!)

RELATED GRIPE:  For all the excessive IQ on this list, I see lots
of poor reading skills.  As an example, I don't know how many of
you have sent responses to me at my CompuServe address, even
though I clearly request otherwise at the end of every one of my
posts.  (Didn't you get that far?)

Often, I see responses to posts that focus on what the reader
-thought- was said, rather than what was -actually- said.  Before
you go shooting from the hip, be sure you are responding to more
than just some emotionally loaded key words.  Also, I'm sure not
all of you read -your own- posts before you launch them into
Cyberspace.

P.S.  Some of you may think this is not a relevant topic for
Cypherpunks.  If so, I suggest you think again.  I leave the
proof of relevance as an exercise for the student.
