An amendment was passed before voting that sunsets the Brady Bill to
five years.  So, effectively, there is a five-year deadline in the
House version.  This ignores the fact that the Feds have admitted that
they cannot *force* states to perform the instant check.  The Brady
Bill only *suggests* that states implement an instant check.

Instant check will initially have some effect on criminals getting
guns, but certainly won't stop them.  From memory, I think the FBI
estimates that over 80% of criminals get their guns from places other
than gun shops (for example, from theft, private sale).  And as the
instant check is implemented, I imagine that the black market will
grow further.  But this doesn't belong on cypherpunks, so I'll shut
up.

I agree, this is important.  In the Virginia instant-check system,
which is a de-facto registration (since they also have a stupid
"one gun a month" law), you cannot check your status unless you
actually try to buy a gun.

Recently, a law-abiding citizen mistakenly tried to purchase a gun
after only 28 days.  He failed the instant check.  After a couple
weeks, troopers showed up at his house and tried to arrest him.  Seems
that he had "made a false statement" on his paperwork, which is a
felony.  Luckily, he did some fast talking and they later decided to
drop all charges.

This whole business make me sick.
