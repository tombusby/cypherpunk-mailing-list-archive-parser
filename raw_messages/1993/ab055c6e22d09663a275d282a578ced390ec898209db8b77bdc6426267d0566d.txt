   Do you know how much NSA employees get paid?  I'm wondering, because it
   is certainly _not_ the case in the CIA.  The "analysts" may make somewhere
   between the $30K - $45K range, but that's hardly "good pay" for people
   who are experts on that kind of analysis, especially when they have Ph.D.s.
