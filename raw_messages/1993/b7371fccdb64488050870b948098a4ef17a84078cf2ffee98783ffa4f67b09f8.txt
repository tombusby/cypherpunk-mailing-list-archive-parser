I think this is probably the best solution proposed to date.

Does the RSA-signed DH key exchange mentioned above provide security
against possible spoofing on the remailer machine (someone else using the
agreed-upon port)? How exactly would such a thing be implemented?

On the user side, I think a good tool to augment this would be a
mailer program which kept a list of the functioning remailers with
keys, and randomly selected a route through them using a random
(reasonable) number of hops, and performing the necessary nested
encryptions.  Then it could start the remailer hopping process via
special socket connection to the first remailer in the chain.

Perhaps a protocol could be worked out for the mailer program to
request from any one of the remailers a current list of the
functioning remailers? (in an effort to transparentize the process
some more, as manually maintaining a list of current remailers would
be tedious.)


We would need to work out the protocol details beforehand, such as how
to handle busy ports etc.
(Who wants to work on this project with me?)


Can someone supply a reference for DH key exchange? (for me, as I don't
know the details and so can't implement it. (is it patented?))
