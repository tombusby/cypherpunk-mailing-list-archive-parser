	I eagerly FTP'ed to aql.gatech.edu to get the latest issue of
Phrack only to find that it is compressed in a form that I can not
uncompress.  My access to the Internet is through a subscription-service
and does not provide shell access.  I can manipulate .z, .Z, and .tar, but
not .gz.  Is there any way for me to get an issue of Phrack-43 that I can
read?
