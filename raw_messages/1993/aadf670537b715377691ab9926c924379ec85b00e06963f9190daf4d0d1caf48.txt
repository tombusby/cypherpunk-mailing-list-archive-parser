Hmmm, are you talking about '4m'? That is a similarly goaled communication
system as well. Currently it exists in plain text format, between the clients
and the (as of today, five) servers. The system has always been destined to
have encryption built into it, from triple des and PK for the key
transactions.

To get into it quickly ftp /pub/misc/4m-212.tar.Z from ftp.santafe.edu and
install. It runs on suns, bsd, aix and similar. I have an hpux port done by
someone if it is required.

It would seem smarter to develop an already existing and debugged instead of
reinventing the wheel.

Contact chasin@santafe.edu for details.
