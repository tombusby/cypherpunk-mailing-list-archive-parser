I'm sorry that I didn't answer your poll. However, if I had a little bit more time I 
would have answered it. Unfortunately, this mailing list is so expansive (and my time
is so limited) that I only read my mail about once a week. So I became aware of the
poll's closing date (last Thursday, 3/6) the next day (i.e., 4/6). Please give a
little more time in future. It was a GREAT idea. Thanks for doing it.

Cheers,
	Peter.

P.S. In case you're still interested in accumulating results, I respond to email on
Sony News-OS V. 4.3 (analogous to Berkeley 4.1). I also use a lot of MS-DOS PCs
(mostly on the Elec. Eng. Novell network, although I might be acquiring a 486 pretty
soon). As for PGP, ... well I OFFICIALLY don't have a copy, being not a resident of
North America :-) ...
