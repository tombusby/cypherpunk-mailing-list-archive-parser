Yes, this seems fraught with problems.

I agree.

The BlueWave blurb was added by the program & can be stripped by
re-editing the message before upload.  Everything else is out of my
control completely & added automagically by the host or the UUCP
gateway.  The sucker stays, no matter what I do.  Some anonymity!

 Uu> 2) Cut-Here: lines of various sorts, either following a pre-specified

I, personally, could live with it just to get the remailers to be truly
anonymous.  The rest of the user input is not especially easy anyway,
particularly if accessing internet via a gateway.  Another line wouldn't
kill me.

 Uu> 3) Encryption-based systems, which only retain the encrypted portion;
 Uu> this means the user has to know more about the remailers being
 Uu> used, and there has to be a standard for expressing which remailers
 Uu> to forward to if more than one will be used (which it probably will
 Uu> be, for anybody security-aware enough to really want an encrypting
 Uu> remailer.)

As an interrim measure I guess this is what I'll have to do, but as an
early PGP partisan, I've had enough PGP experience not to be turned off
by the extra trouble.  Most casual users would be.  In any case, I think
that this is undoubtedly the most user-labor-intensive solution.

In that case, let's have this solved by Monday. 8-)
