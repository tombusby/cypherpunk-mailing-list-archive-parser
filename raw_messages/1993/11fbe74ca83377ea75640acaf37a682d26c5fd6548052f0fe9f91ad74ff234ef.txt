What you want to avoid is giving any spooks/agents the ability to:

A> Quickly scan GIFs (or whatever) on your hard disk (or .binary.
newsgroups) for files that are "likely" to be hiding something.

B> Be able to prove that you have an encrypted file. If they get that proof
they can apply pressure to you to get the key.

Anything that allows either of the above is only providing moderate security.
