  The Law Enforcement Field is used by my clipper chip to make the
session key it is using available to the gov't.  Would it be possible
that my clipper chip could have a subtle flaw causing the LEF (sp?)
data to be corrupted?  Would my chip still function; would I be able
to use it to to communicate with other clipper chips?  Would anyone be
able to tell that my chip was broken without the help of the key
escrow agents?  Would the sesion key still be recoverable if the
clipper chip at the other end were working 'correctly'?
