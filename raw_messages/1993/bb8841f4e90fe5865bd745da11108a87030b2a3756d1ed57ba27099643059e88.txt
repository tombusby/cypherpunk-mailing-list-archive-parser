        I tried e-mail but the message is bouncing around like a
        kangaroo on certain controlled substances.  The following is
        a list of bookstores dealing, more or less specifically with
        espionage and intelligence and include some coverage of
        crypto.  My recommendation for the first title would be
        to try Elm.  If you contact C&D, ELM, or NIBC, mentioning
        my name _might_ help.
