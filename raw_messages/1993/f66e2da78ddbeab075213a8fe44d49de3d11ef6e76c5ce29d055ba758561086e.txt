> Mappings defined by polynomials modulo n=pq are a fundamental tool in
> modern cryptography.  However, the inversion of such mappings usually
> requires the extraction of roots or the evaluation of high degree
> polynomials, which is quite slow.  This talk will consist of two parts.
> In the first part, we give an introduction to some basic cryptographic
> techniques.  The second part will describe some new results in the area.
> We consider the class of birational permutations f, in which both f and
> f^-1 are low degree multivariate rational functions mod n.  We describe
> new families of birational permutations, and how to turn them into new
> cryptographic schemes which are much faster than previously known
> schemes.  In addition, we consider the general problems of factoring
> multivariate polynomials mod n and solving systems of polynomial
> equations mod n, and develop new techniques for proving the hardness of
> randomly chosen instances of such problems.
> 
> The talk will be self contained and accessible to a wide audience.
