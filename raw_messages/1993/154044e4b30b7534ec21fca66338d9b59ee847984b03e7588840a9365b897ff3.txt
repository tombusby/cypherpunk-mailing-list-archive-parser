A new Request for Comments is now available in online RFC libraries.


        RFC 1422:

        Title:      Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail:
                    Part II: Certificate-Based Key Management

This is one of a series of documents defining privacy enhancement
mechanisms for electronic mail transferred using Internet mail
protocols.  This memo is the outgrowth of a series of meetings of the
Privacy and Security Research Group of the Internet Research Task
Force (IRTF) and the Privacy-Enhanced Electronic Mail Working Group of
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  The author would like to
thank the members of the PSRG and the PEM WG for their comments and
contributions at the meetings which led to the preparation of this
document.  The author also would like to thank contributors to the
PEM-DEV mailing list ("pem-dev@tis.com") who have provided valuable
input which is reflected in this memo.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet
community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol
Standards" for the standardization state and status of this protocol.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@CNRI.RESTON.VA.US.  Requests to be added
to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should be sent to
RFC-REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.

Details on obtaining RFCs via FTP or EMAIL may be obtained by sending
an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with the message body
