I talked to Herb Linnen at AT & T.  He talked to me some but kept harping
on the point of how ATT is devoted to customer privacy and that the ATT
Vice-President of Information Systems (I forget his name) is an expert on
cryptography and he obviously can't be wrong when he says that the wiretap
chip is robust.

He asked that I call David Arneke or Bill Jones at 919-279-7680 to discuss
this since his department wasn't involved in the wiretap chip.

The ATT operators dealing with calling cards and residential phone service
have had other people cancelling their accounts because of this...
