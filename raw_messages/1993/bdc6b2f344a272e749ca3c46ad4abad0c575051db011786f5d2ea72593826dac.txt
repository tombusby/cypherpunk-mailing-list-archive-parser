Good stuff.

Please explain this to me.  What is "Shamir?"

Or how about if the "cool" messages stop comming in, you are to send the files
to someone else.  This way, if you "can't" send the "OK" message for some 
reason, the "right" people will get the data anyway.  Is there any interest in
setting this kind of think up.  I'm currently "holding onto" some data for a 
friend, and could probably manage a few Megs more if someone has the need.  In
an ideal world, this would be done on an anonymous, distributed basis.  Any
comments?
