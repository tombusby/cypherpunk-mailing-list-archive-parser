-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The remailer at elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu now pads messages.

So as not to be too annoying, messages under 1K are padded to 1K;
larger messages are untouched.  Padding is calculated by the size of
the message body as it goes to sendmail - the header doesn't enter in
the calculation.

This remailer also caches messages until midnight; this is being
mailed out early because I forced it.

This message is shorter than 1K, so there will be some padding below
(after the signature block).

Coming soon: explanation of what I'm doing :-)
