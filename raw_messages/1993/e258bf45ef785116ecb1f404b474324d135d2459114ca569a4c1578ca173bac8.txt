some special signs. Could be feasible, but we would get some rather
weird addresses...

This could be a problem. Anon.penet.fi is currently a feeble 25 Mhz 386,
and I have already ordered the replacement, a 60 Mhz 486 to handle the

Anon.penet.fi already does this. As long as we have something to pattern
match for (to separate alt.sex.bestiality@anon.penet.fi from
xy656b-akw@anon.penet.fi).

Have to sleep on it (it's 8:30pm here in finland), but it sounds
feasible to me...
