Hi again!
 
     I've gotten some real good replies to my question regarding whether I
should use procmail to send pgp advertisements.  The overwhelming response has
been that I shouldn't.  I will instead, as was suggested, put my advertisement
in my heading, like my pgp key info.  Any suggestions as to what to put there?
 
     I have also been asked if I intend to post my procmail rc file.  Yes, I do. 
As soon as I have tested it and feel finished, I will post it to the list.  I've
only been using procmail for ~4 days.
 
     By the end of the week-end, I will have procmail preprocessing my incoming
encrypted email, a non-secure key on the mainframe to sign quick letters with,
and a secure message-signing and transport system on my pc at home.  I intend
to run the link program from within Telix and Use Mike Ingle's encrypted disk
driver.  Short of burying my computer under 500 feet of concrete, what else can
I do to build a reasonably secure system at home?  Just for the Hell of it. ;^)
