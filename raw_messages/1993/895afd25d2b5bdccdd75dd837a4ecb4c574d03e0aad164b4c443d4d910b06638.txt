One point is being missed here - a chain of remailers is as strong as
its STRONGEST link.  As long as even ONE remailer in the chain is
trustworthy, hiding the connection between incoming and outgoing messages,
your anonymity is preserved.

The suggestion that remailers themselves choose the routing path means
that you have to trust the remailer that chooses the path.  If it is
corrupt, it can defeat the effect of the path.  To protect yourself,
you want to use many remailers in the chain, and use a system which
does not require you to trust any one remailer.  Having the remailers
choose the path does not really help.
