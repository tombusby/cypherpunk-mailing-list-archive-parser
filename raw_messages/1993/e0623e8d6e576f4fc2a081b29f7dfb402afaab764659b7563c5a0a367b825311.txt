Something like this is probably more practical:
 
1. Driver's license is presented in person to you or qualified staff.
2. Driver's license and two other ID from list are presented in person
   to you or qualified staff
3. Driver's license is presented in person to registered notary public
   and stamped certificate sent to you.
4. Driver's license and two other ID from list are presented in person
   to registered notary public and stamped certificate sent to you.
 
I would avoid accepting xeroxes altogether; too easy to forge.
 
 
would you change your mind if i told you that i hold three passports in three differe
nt names?
