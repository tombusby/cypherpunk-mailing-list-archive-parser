>>>a chance to work a PGP angle into some sensational story that 
creates a lot of public outcry.  Linking PGP to terrorism, drug 
dealing, or kiddie porn would be a great first step towards 
getting some laws against "unlicensed cryptography" on the books.<<<

Too late.  Open systems are beyond the point of no return.  Worriers
forget the "tipping factor".  Once half of the mass of an object is
above its center of gravity, it starts to fall over fast.

The unsexy bits of the digital revolution - EDI, electronic trading,
the quants, the ISO reference model have already worked their wonders
and started the tipping process.  Perestroika (restructuring) is
here to stay.

Without PGP, without cypherpunks, without UUNET, without any of it
governments would still see their mechanisms of control crumble.  Cheap
computing and telecoms by themselves are enough to render the nation
state technologically obsolete.

Read from the bottom up:

Anarchists              Application
Communists or           Communication
Socialists              System
Trust                   Transport
Never                   Network
Departments             Datalink
Police                  Physical
