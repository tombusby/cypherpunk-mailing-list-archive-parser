Ok, so far I have orders for 2450 stickers and statements indicateing $65
in donations. I'll send the order in tomorrow morning. Note that if no
more orders come in I'll have 6350 stickers on my hands and not much to do
with them (I plan on keeping at least 250, maybe 500 for personal use.
Another 1000 could be distributed localy. That still leaves 4850
stickers.) and I'll be about 75$ in the hole (however that's not a .big.
stress on my finances for now). So if you want stickers I've got plenty to
give away, and if you have any cash with my name on it, well, I won't argue.
I have received a couple of encrypted messages that I beleive are sticker
orders, give me a few hours to decrypt and respond to those. Dito with
those requesting that I sign stuff. Also remember I need your address in
order to send you anything. 

My address for contributions is

Happy Hunting, -Chris
