 BK> Currently, Jock Gill is

This week's news indicates to me this will probably not improve.

According to Monday night's news, this is from where these vaunted
"symbolic" 25% White House staff cuts will come.

Yes, silly us.

 BK> SUGGESTION:  Use the compuserve address you have judiciously,

Oh, yes, _certainly_!  The _vital_ stuff should go into a nonexistant
system.  Naturally!

 BK> Until such time that a

Can anyone say, "VAPORWARE"?

Pass it around?  You bet.  It's f*cking _hilarious_!  My guess is that
this gaffe will (or at least ought to) get Gill fired, assuming he
survives this "symbolic" staff downsizing.  I might add that nothing
could be more "symbolic" than the announcement that the cuts will come
from those who actually respond to public input.  This "go away & don't
bother us" move on the part of the Clinton administration indicates that
it obviously doesn't care _what_ America thinks.
.   There is a _bright side_ to this, however:  Would such an
indifferent administration spend resources trying to break our codes
when it doesn't care what we have to say anyway? 8-)
