These problems will exist in any distributed system, so solutions need
to be worked out.

Why have an administration at all? Why not just give everyone an
/exclude command which eliminates everything from a particular person,
and an /include command which restores output from that person.
If someone is ranting or flooding, everyone will /exclude him and he 
will be left with only himself for an audience.
