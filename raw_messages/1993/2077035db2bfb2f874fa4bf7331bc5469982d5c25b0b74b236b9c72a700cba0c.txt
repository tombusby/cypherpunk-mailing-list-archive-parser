The remailed email from tamsun and tamaix have the same format, but you have
interpreted the headers incorrectly.  Please note that you@yourhost mentioned
above is not the sender's address but rather the recipients address.  You might
have been confused by this if you were sending and reading from the same
account.  The mail from tamsun and tamaix IS anonymous.  Take a look at this
piece of the header for your message to the cypherpunks list:
 
Received: by tamsun.tamu.edu id AA24627
  (5.65b/IDA-1.4.3 for cypherpunks@toad.com); Fri, 9 Jul 93 16:21:06 -0500
 
As you can see you@yourhost as you demarked in your message actually refers to
the recepient's address and not the sender's.  If I have misunderstood your
message, please excuse.  I just felt compelled to clear any doubts about the
anonymity of these two remailers.
 
Please feel free to reply to me personally if you'd like to get a close look at
the remailers.
 
ciao,
Carlos
