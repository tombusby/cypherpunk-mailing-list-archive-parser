Amen.

I am trying to read and understand the Niels Ferguson "Off-line Coins"
article, the "Efficient Off-line Digital Cash" paper also from CWI and 
the Netcash paper. Were you the one critical of the Netcash paper 
because it didn't offer unconditional untraceability? Do the papers I
just listed require observer chips, or are they OK for software-only?

We have PageMaker, CAD ware, someday we may have "ChipMaker"
to create "chipscript" robotic control files to make our own
monolithic IC's. In the short term, perhaps we can distribute
shareware hardware designs using low-cost components to 
avoid back doors in manufactured comm gear.

In other words, if we can't see the "source code" for the 
hardware design, or "compile" it ourselves, maybe we shouldn't
really trust it.

What particular design would you like to see widely 
implemented now given these objections to observer chips?
Is there software we can use NOW for ATM's and banks?
