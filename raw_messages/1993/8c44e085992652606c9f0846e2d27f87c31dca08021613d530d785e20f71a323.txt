Not necessarily. If you use pklite or lzexe, you produce an automatically
self-decompressing executable that will appear to have a much flatter
distribution than an ordinary exe file.

What we need is a crypto version of pklite - instead of (or in addition to)
compressing the executable, it encrypts it and sticks a stub decryptor
on the front of the executable. Each time you run it, it prompts you for
a password, decrypts and decompresses the executable and runs it.
