However the list was founded and is dominated by extropians and (small e) 
expropianism is the dominent philosophy of the nets.

Ned Lud and the boys wished to keep themselves and everyone else poor, 
smash technology, and stop the world just so they would not have to 
transform their lives.  Just like the french farmers of today.  Since one 
must already have transformed one's life to get connected to the nets (at 
least at this stage of technology) there can't be too many genuine 
luddites here.  

If anyone qualifies as luddites in this contrroversy it is the 
*government*.  They are trying to slow the pace of technological 
transformation because it realizes that bureaucratic structures are 
hopless market competitors and will be destroyed by technological change.

I, for one, am not going to permint the neeo-luddites of the coercive 
state apparatus to stop change just so they can avoid honest work.
