It's good to see more people working on remailers.  The cypherpunks
remailers have been written in Perl, which facilitates experimenting
and testing of new interfaces.  The idea might be to migrate them
to C eventually for efficiency, but during this experimental phase
we may want to try out new ideas, and it's easier to modify a Perl
script than a C program.

This is somewhat similar to the cypherpunks remailers; however, they
accept the :: only at the beginning of the message, allow any fields to
be put there that the user desires (not just those three), and terminate
the block by a blank line.  Does your alternate system have some
advantages?

I do find the use of this string to produce rather complicated looking
commands.  The cypherpunks remailers get the same effect by just putting
in blocks starting with :: and separated by blank lines:

::
Anon-To: anon@anon.penet.fi

::
Anon-To: nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu

This looks simpler to me.
