This is the message I received which complained about "inappropriate
use of the Internet".  He also phoned me to complain.

I know the cyperpunks already know this, but Dave Farber's audience
might not have thought about the implications for free speech of
having the government build a multi billion dollar Internet
replacement.  Bureaucrats and random complaints from third parties on
such a network *will* cause you grief about what you are allowed to
say and do.  The company I buy networking from is Alternet, and
because they exist, I can protect myself from this sort of meddling.
They will not be able to compete with the taxpayer funded "national
information infrastructure", and my only option, if I want to be on
the net, will be to hook up under the government's rules.

If after seeing this this exchange you still don't believe me, talk to
someone at a controversial broadcast radio station.  Radio is living
under that yoke *now*, and they have some real stories to tell.

John, below is the posting I called about.  In my opinion this is
inappropriate use of the Internet.  This person appears to be a virus
author, one who knows virus authors, and/or one who encourages such
activity. 

What is the policy of toad.com concerning such postings?

Keith

> amount of virus bootstrap code which is not encrypted is changed in each
> replication by dispursing random NOP's throughout the virus boostrap code.

> "signature" byte strings to detect polymorphic viruses.
