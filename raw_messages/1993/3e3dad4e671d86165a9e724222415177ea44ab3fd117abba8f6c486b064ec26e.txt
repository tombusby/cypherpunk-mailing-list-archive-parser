I know the site "cypherpunks@indigo.mese.com" was supposedly removed
from the Cypherpunks list, as per a message from Eric Hughes, but I am
getting several bounces per day. I assume you folks are, too.

What's apparent is that each of these long bounces (400-500 lines) is
*getting longer* each cycle through the process. I noticed this when I
was deleting them. I suppose the extra lines--roughly 20 extra lines
each cycle--are more error messages being added by
cypherpunks@indigo.mese.com and then sent back to the List.

This is *not* a complaint, though I hope it stops soon. Instead, it's
a comment that e-mail systems and lists may need (soon!) more
sophisticated positive reputation filters, to screen out such
pathological behaviors, mail bombs, and the like. 

I feel sorry for the List members who are on more restrictive mail
systems, including those who may have to (gulp!) pay for incoming mail
by the byte.
