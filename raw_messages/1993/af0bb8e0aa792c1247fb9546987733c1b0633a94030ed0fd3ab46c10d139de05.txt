By definition, government is the enemy of any anarchic movement.

WE have met the enemy and they are us.
What I hear you saying is that crypto-anarchists will win, and thus
replace the governmement as we know it. ( or perhaps transform the govenrment
as we know it)

Strong crypto in the hands of the individual leads to this scenario.
Thats why strong crypto will be reserved for the privileged, and kept
from those not connected to the power-system.

The privileged members of the unseen-unknown oligarchy have long
enjoyed the privilege of sheltering their wealth. 
I suppose it is the natural progression of things that the individual
slowly gains ground once held by the powerfull and privileged,
but usualy not unless giving that ground makes the privileged more powerful
than before. The margin rarely diminishes, it is an ever widening gulf IMNSHO.

Is there a question regarding whether they *can*?
Of course they *can*, they have more weapons, and  a history of using them.
Don't you really want to ask other things like what happens when/if they do?

whats their option, to just hand over the keys, go have a beer at the 
local pub, and contemplate getting honest jobs instead of fighting
to keep you from destroying  their current way of life?

You are preaching to the choir.
bettre to just keep plugging at implementing those *channels* and 
methods of accessing them.

Our nation is criss crossed with super-highways, but there are plenty
of folks who prefer to stay on the back roads.

Its awfully hard to build competing highways where folks can drive
their un-registered vehicles, because the real-estate involved is
finite.

May I point out that cyberspace has un-real estate, and that there is 
all you want.

Whats that old saying about Death and taxes.
Given the choice between these two necesary evils , 
which one would you choose.

*Give me liberty or give me death* is the cry of the revolutionary
who is already marked as an enemy of the state.

Go shout it in a crowd and march on the halls of government.
see how many line up behind you to join in the fun.

I think it is unwise to use linear thinking to try and deduce what 
the ultimate outcome of this complex equation may look like.

When you evoke a Demon into the triangle, you can utter the command

that it will be so.

Yup..

The problem with secrets is  that if you share them with too many people

WE are primates, we live in primate societys.
survival of primate-alpha hierarchy is the first order of 
business.
Fight it and you will die or be driven out.
