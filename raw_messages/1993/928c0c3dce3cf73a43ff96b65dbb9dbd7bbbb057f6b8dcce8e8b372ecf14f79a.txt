Cyphertentacles,

The new crypto newsroup, talk.politics.crypto, is almost wholly
devoted now to the flames and rants of Detweiler and people respoding
to him. I checked for the new messages there this morning and this is
the list I got back:


1       The Data Highway Patrol                         Olaf Seibert
2  +    CRYPTOANARCHIST INFILTRATION ALERT              Lvx Fiat
3  +    CRYPTOANARCHISTS ARE LIKE DRUG DEALERS          Pablo Escobar      
4  +    THE CRYPTOANARCHIST CONSPIRACY                  S.Boxx
5  +    THE GLORIOUS 1000 YEAR CRYPTOANARCHIST REICH    The Allied Forces 


I know you're tired of Detweiler discussions, but I thought this to be
an interesting snapshot of things.
