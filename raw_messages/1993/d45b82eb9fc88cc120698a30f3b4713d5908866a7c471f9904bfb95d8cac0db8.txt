Hey guys,

I set PAGER to "pgp -m" (with the full path, of course) in my .mailrc,
and I use the PGPmail wrapper from Jason L. Steiner (way to go Jason!)
to sign and encrypt mail.

This seems to work fine, since it leaves the message encrypted and all
in the mbox (or wherever) unless I choose to save it (when pgp asks)

thanks for all the help.
