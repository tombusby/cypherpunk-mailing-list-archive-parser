hmm...  I am using d3des which I had assumed uses 'tripple-DES'.
at any rate,  I used the Ddes() function, printed its output,
then used the des() function 3 times and prined its output.  They
matched up which suggests that d3des uses the method I posted at
the top.

interesting.  Wouldnt the first scheme do the same?  for k1=k2, and
k3 = any key ?
(or k2=k3 and k1 = any key)
