Some time back there was some debate here about whether MIME
("Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions") features could be exploited
to make encryption easier to use.  I didn't pay much attention at the
time, because I didn't know anything about MIME.  But then a couple of
weeks ago John Gilmore posted about Metamail, a software system
designed to make it easy to integrate MIME into commonly-used mailers.

I've played with Metamail a bit, and I do think this could be a good
approach.  Metamail basically performs a mail-sorting function,
automatically passing mail which has the MIME "Content-type" header to
a filter or display program based on a very flexible "mailcap" file.
To add PGP (or PEM, or RIPEM) support would be a matter of defining a
Content-type header for this application, then creating the
appropriate 1-line entry in the mailcap file.  This does sound like a
pretty easy way to add this capability.

The nice thing is, Metamail has already done the work of figuring out
how to patch a whole bunch of different mailers to add this support.
By using metamail we would be leveraging off this already-existing
work.  Here are some excerpts from the "mailers.txt" file that comes
with the distribution, written by Nathaniel S. Borenstein:

I am very impressed with the range of mailers covered here.
Unfortunately, access to source is needed for most of the patches.
But my guess would be that patched versions would become available
even to people who don't have source.

I'm not really sure what is happening with PGP specifically in terms
of MIME.  I think there has been some work done with PEM integration.
There doesn't seem to be any reason why these programs can't integrate
nicely with MIME, and this Metamail package looks like it might be the
most cost-effective way of getting widespread encryption into use.
