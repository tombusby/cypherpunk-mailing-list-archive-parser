  In a way, I agree, but I am skeptical on the price point we will be able
to achieve compared to just cannibalizing a ClipperPhone for spare parts.
Ideally, the "cypherpunk phone" should consist of
1) cheap v.32 modem (<$200)
2) cheap 8bit sampler/audio card
3) CELP vocoder ardware, or cheap DSP with it implemented in software
4) a fast 486 (to do real time 3DES/IDEA @ CELP rates)

   Most people already have 1,4, they need 2,3 which will cost anywhere from
$300-600 depending on what kind of DSP you get. This is too much money
for such a standard to proliferate. If the ClipperPhones are cheaper, we
could do better to buy those and cannibalize them for parts.

(maybe we could convince ZyXeL to add an "auto-CELP-comp" mode like v.42
to their modems with built in CELP? )
