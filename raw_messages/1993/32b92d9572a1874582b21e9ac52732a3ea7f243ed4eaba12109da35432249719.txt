Well "slots" is a misnomer. There is space in the tunnels. They were
designed for holding lots of phone cable, much of which has dried up
since the copper has started to be replaced with fiber. Fiber takes up
extraordinarily little space, so unless hundreds of companies wanted
to use the same space there wouldn't be real trouble. The space is
both directly and indirectly owned by the city -- some of it is in the
form of subway tunnels and subway access tunnels that are officially
controlled by the MTA, but are de facto controlled by the city.

And no, they have to like you to let you use them.

I can buy one now. It expensive, but the price is falling. Lehman can
purchase lines from Nynex, Teleport, Metrofiber, and several other
vendors. Vendors WANT to be in the business -- it makes them money,
after all. Car companies don't conspire to avoid selling people cars,
and I doubt deregulated carriers would spend their days trying to find
ways looking for methods to avoid selling people services. What IS a
problem is that many of these carriers can't yet gain access to
customers because of regulations. Manhattan Cable has fiber to every
block in the city -- but was forbidden by the city from competing with
the phone companies for data transmission services.

Indeed, the only companies I ever see looking for ways to avoid having
to provide services are regulated monopolies.

Yes.

The same is true in New York, where there are multiple companies
serving distinct areas of the city.

This is not universally true, however. There are some areas where
multiple cable companies provide overlapping service areas.

I believe so, since it would otherwise be difficult to meter the power
usage. If both companies shared a customer grid, how could you know
who's power was being used? (Power companies do have a grid for
transfering power between their generators, but thats another story.)

Apparently.

I imagine its much like the way one switches heating from oil to gas
-- someone comes to your house and does a bit of physical work,
usually leaving the old infrastructure in place.

Ah, but it is important. If a monopoly is an artificial creature of
government, and not natural, that means that prices are being
artificially kept high BY THE GOVERNMENT. That also means that your
dream of universal access is being blocked.

You are certainly correct -- but thats part of the way the free market
works. When you can't get financing for your project it probably means
people don't believe there is a market any more. The first five cable
companies get business, and profits shrink as price wars occur, and
then few new players enter the market. I suspect the first several
players will get money, and thats all you need.

Hell, nothing is more expensive in capital costs than starting an
airline -- and yet people get financing for airlines all the time.

I'd leave the worries about how to finance these things to the
investors, who are after all the people who's money is at risk.

Then I would suggest calling them up and asking them for something on
utility regulation.

Nope, they didn't. If necessary, we can dig up references.

Ah, but you have been arguing against the elimination of state granted
cable monopolies, haven't you? If not, please let me know because then
there is no reason for me to argue.
