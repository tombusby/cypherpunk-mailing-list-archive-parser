{\bf A.1 Cycle Structure Tests}

The first set of tests examined the cycle structure of SKIPJACK.  Fix
a set of keys, $\cal K$, a plaintext, $m$, and a function $h\; : \;
{\cal M} \longrightarrow {\cal K}$, where ${\cal M}$ is the set of all
64 bit messages.  Let $f \; : \; {\cal K} \longrightarrow {\cal K}$ be
defined as $f(k) = h ( SJ(k,m))$ (where $SJ(k,m)$ denotes the SKIPJACK
encryption of plaintext $m$ with key $k$).  Let $N = |\cal K|$.  The
expected cycle length of $f$ is $\sqrt{\pi N /8}$.  We chose sets of
$\cal K$ with $N \; = \; 2^{10}, 2^{16}, 2^{24}, 2^{32},
2^{40}, 2^{48}, 2^{56}$.  For all of these $N$, the mean of the cycle
lengths computed across all experiments was close to an expected
relative error of
$(1/\sqrt{j}$ for $j$ experiments) of the expected cycle length.  
We did not do this test with larger sets of keys because of the time
constraints.

{\bf A.2 Statistical Randomness and Correlation Tests}

The second set of tests examined whether there were any correlations
between the input and output of SKIPJACK, or between a key and the
output.  We also looked for nonrandomness in functions of the form
$SJ(k,m) \oplus SJ(k,m \oplus h)$ and functions of the form $SJ(k,m) \oplus
SJ(k \oplus h , m)$ for all $h$ of Hamming weight 1 and 2 and for some
randomly chosen $h$.  All results were consistent with these functions
behaving like random functions.

Given a set of $N$ numbers of $k$-bits each, a chi-square test will
test the hypothesis that this set of numbers was drawn (with
replacement) from a uniform distribution on all of the $2^k$, $k$-bit
numbers.  We ran the tests using a 99\% confidence level.  A truly
random function would pass the test approximately 99\% of the time.
The test is not appropriate when $N/2^k$ is too small, say $\leq 5$.
Since it was infeasible to run the test for $k = 64$, we would pick 8
bit positions, and generate a set of $N= 10,000$ numbers, and run the
test on the $N$ numbers restricted to those 8 bit positions (thus
$k=8$).  In some of the tests, we selected the 8 bits from the output
of the function we were testing, and in others, we selected 4 bits
from the input and 4 from the output.

Some of the tests were run on both the encryption and decryption
functions of SKIPJACK.  The notation $SJ^{-1}(k,m)$ will be used to
denote the decryption function of SKIPJACK with key $k$ on message
$m$.

{\bf Test 1: Randomness test on output.  } In a single test: Fix $k$,
fix mask of 8 output bits, select 10,000 random messages, run
chi-square on the 10,000 outputs restricted to the mask of 8 output
bits.  Repeat this single test for 200 different values of $k$ and 50
different masks, for a total of 10,000 chi-square tests.  We found
that .87\% of the tests failed the 99\% confidence level chi-square
test.  This is within a reasonable experimental error of the expected
value of 1\%.  On the decryption function, there were only .64\% of
the tests that failed.  This was on a much smaller test set.
