Greetings. Sorry for the delay, I hope you all had a wonderful holiday.

We are finishing up the t-shirt design, and it will soon be made 
available for approval in it's entirity. The plan is to have people order 
before the end of January (February 1st being the cutoff), and have the 
shirts shipped out in the first week of February. We are doing only as 
many shirts as we get orders for, hence the mass mailing.

I will be posting an update in the next few days with information on the 
preview files and ordering information.

The t-shirts will cost approximately $10 each, and will include shipping, 
etc. All additional information will be posted in the next update...

We are only doing one mass run of this design, so it will not be made 
available again in the future.

If anyone has any questions or comments please mail me. Thanks.
