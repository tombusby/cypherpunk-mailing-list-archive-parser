Ross Williams has distributed a nice summary of the current
NIST/PKP/DSA situation in sci.crypt, entitled "NIST/PKP scandal: All
you need to act."

It's 2000 lines, so I'm not sending it out to the entire List (and,
no, I was not the one Lance said chastised him, at least not so far as
I know). Anyone without Usenet access to sci.crypt can mail me and
I'll forward to you the Williams article. If enough folks are
sci-crypt-deprived, perhaps I'll post the whole thing.

Cheers, 

-Tim
