That's a big if.  I think the idea is interesting, but would *very* much like
to see this tested first on a set of "play" remailers, which are advertised as
being for research only, don't trust them to actually work, etc.

MIME, in particular, solves this problem, along with many others.  Three cheers
for Metamail!  Specifically, you can have several seperate messages within your
RFC822 message, arranged hierarchially.  You could have your public key, your
cute .sig, your message, your signature for the message, contact information
for you, a JPEG image (of your cat, say), and a sound ("meow") all in the same
mail message.  There is even faint hope that it would be portable.
