I'm sorry, I didn't realize that you wanted to erect a barrier against
anonymous newbies, such as "wonderer" and "Dark Unicorn" were recently. You
know, Detweiler might get a new account under a new name, better seal the
list to only postings from "previously authenticated" accounts too. Then
we'd be all happy and safe from the dreaded Detweiler.

Don't let this guy screw up the positive aspects of the list. His irritant
is the by-product of the free world that we are trying to create. You can't
stop his communication without comprimising our own goals. (You can delete
it without reading it or kill file him or once we are on extropians list
software, ::exclude him.)

I'm not entirely against positive reputation systems, but they really need
to be implimented on the user end, or at least be user settings, as on the
extropians list.

But the main problem with positive reputation systems is dealing with the
zero reputation newbies. I don't want to see these guys shut out.

Think well, before you act on this impulse.
