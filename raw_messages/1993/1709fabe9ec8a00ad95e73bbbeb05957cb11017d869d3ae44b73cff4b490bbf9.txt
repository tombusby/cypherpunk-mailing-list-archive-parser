NO!  She is not ``given'' the key.  That would imply that it is known to
someone else!  She makes the key herself using tools provided for that
purpose.

This is a serious misconception.  Public key encryption does not depend
on any ``authority'' for issuing keys.  She is the only one anywhere who
need know the key.

Please correct this misconception in your mind and others with whom you
discuss the subject.  It can cause public key encryption to become
identified in people's minds with hierarchical authority, which it
emphatically is not.  The author takes control of her own privacy and
need not rely on anyone else to maintain it.

Why then would a ``private citizen'' limit herself to 140 digits?  The
software is readily available for her to use a key large enough that
cracking it is not feasible even by government.
