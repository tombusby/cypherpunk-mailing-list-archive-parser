check out the newly released PCPINE.  It is a pine client for IBMpc's.
It will run either stand alone (with packet drivers, using WATTCP),
under FTP's PC/TCP package, or under Novell.  (There are three
different files, one for each configuration).  To use it you
need to get a mail server running the IMAP protocol daemon
'imapd'.  It is like POP but has more advanced features.

You can find both at
  ftp.cac.washington.edu
in pine or pub/pine.

  c-client.tar.Z     <- has impad for unix boxes
  pcpine_p.zip     packet driver version
  pcpine_n.zip     novell version
  pcpine_f.zip     ftp pctcp version

pcpine has mostly all the PINE features, and is easily configured
for external mail processing add ons (like gif viewers and crypto 
stuff).  (note: 'easy' is a relative term :)
