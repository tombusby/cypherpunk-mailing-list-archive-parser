 In a word: No. The name is fine (Cypherpunks), and the attitude is
 great. There are plenty  of us who do wear ties on a daily basis and

 Now if we can "Win the hearts and minds" of the public and change

 BTW, who (off-hand) knows the fax number of the G. Gordon Liddy show
 at WJFK in Washington? I have this fax I need for him to see ....
 
 Cheers.
