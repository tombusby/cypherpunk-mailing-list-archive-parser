Right on, but this would conflict, at least in spirit, with your points
2)b) and 2)d).  Are your for govt. involvement or not?

Pardon me, but this is preposterous.  You have here proposed that a
many-to-many communications medium, which requires data service, is not a
basic service despite its many benefits, but that cable and broadcast tv
are, despite the obvious limitations (not to mention detrimental effects)
of the medium.  I hate to even say this, especially to you, but that's
just not a logical stance, especially for a networker.  I'm actually
shocked to see you say that.

But not just the rich will pay for it.  *I* will have to pay for it, and
I'd rather see it be cheap and affordable to all.  You seem to have
mistaken the empowering technology of networking with some new toy, like
Nintendos.

Not if the medium fails to catch on, due to being too expensive for anyone but
the upper class.  This is precisely why most people *don't* have satellite tv.
