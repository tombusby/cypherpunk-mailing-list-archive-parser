Yup -- I was assuming no padding.

If you allow padding, I already have a secret-key cipher which uses random
padding in order to frustrate known-plaintext attacks.  My favorite method
uses a key to initialize a PRNG whose output gives the number of bytes of
each stream to put in the output stream -- then encipher the PRNG key
followed by the multiplexed stream.  One of the streams being multiplexed
(and there can be a huge number, if you're encrypting an archive, for
example) can and should be random -- so that if you make a small change
and re-encrypt, you don't end up with cribs.

For this purpose, you'd need to have several files hanging around your
machine of random numbers yet to be used for padding.

Meanwhile, I have several files of random numbers which I keep around for
running simulations.

My favorite random number generator is

	compress - </dev/audio | idea | tran | idea | tran | idea

where the idea keys are chosen randomly and there's no mic plugged in
at /dev/audio.

Other people might generate random numbers other ways. :-)
[but you might keep my method around, for demonstrating to the cops.]
