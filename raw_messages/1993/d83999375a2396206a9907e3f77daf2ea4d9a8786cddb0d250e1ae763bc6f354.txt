Sorry, I should have done some more reading before I posted. What I'm
after is a "Fair Cryptosystem". I'm not happy with the whole idea of
escrowed keys, but in this case, it's the best solution which will be
accepted by this organization.

Micali describes how the user can generate their own key and create
verifiable pieces for the escrow agents. Does anyone know of code which
implements this scheme?
