Just in...got "Testimony by Stephen T. Walker, President, Trusted
Information Systems, Inc., for Subcommittee on Economic Policy, Trade and
Environment, Committee on Foreign Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives,
October 12, 1993".  This is about a 75k document, and is to be found via
FTP as:

 ftp.eff.org: /pub/eff/temp/testimon.tis

It begins thusly:

"I am pleased to testify today about the negative impact that U.S. export
control regulations on cryptography are having on one of the few
industries where the U.S.  remains dominant worldwide:  the information
system software industry.  The major point of my testimony are that U.S.
export controls do not prevent the international availability of good
quality cryptography but do penalized the U.S. software industry and U.S.
business in general."

I'd post it, but it's 1500+ lines.
