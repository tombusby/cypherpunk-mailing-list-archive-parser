I'm interested in starting a key management workshop for the purpose of
learning more about how to properly manage keys, the use of anon
remailers, hopping mail, and pgp in general.  

I would appreciate copies of your public key if you are interested in
participating.  

Please keep in mind this exersise is for EXPERIMENTAL PURPOSES ONLY.  I'm
running pgp on a shared system, therefore the security here is not fully
tamperproof (ie. passwords can be picked up on the line from this local
machine to the remote site). If you would rather submit a "test" key,
please do so. 

I would like to know if anyone on either list has objections to using the
cypherpunks@toad.com and/or austin-cypherpunks@mcfeeley.utexas.edu list as
places of exchange of group messages.  

One last thing; any information on the format for hopping mail through
encryption supported remailers would be appreciated.  

I look forward to your support and participation.  

Thank you,
