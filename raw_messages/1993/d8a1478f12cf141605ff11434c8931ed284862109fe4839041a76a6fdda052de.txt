While I may have been one of the first to "sound the alarm," let's get
it straight -- up front -- that I do not condone any type of OS
subversive program that conducts it's "activities" without the user's
knowledge, or any code that has the potential to propogate without
user's knowledge.
 
That said, I think I qualify well enough as an "anti-virus
professional," even though I don't -officially- produce any antivirus
software for public consumption. In any case, I'm mano-en-mano with
most of the notables in the field.

I'd like to examine a copy myself.

Words escape me at the moment -- perhaps its all those damned
Mooseheads...

[Mooseheads-kicking-in mode]
 
"Cypherpunks write code" should be expanded (in fact, it -is-
expanded, to a certain extent) to include beneficial vs
non-beneificial software. But what delineates the two?
 
This is a -very- touchy subject.
 
"Subversive software," is a term which I use to demonstrate the
properties of software which spoofs someone, in one way or another.
Viruses do this, especially what we call "stealth" viruses, because of
their ability to spoof the operating system.
 
"Subversive software," in the terminolgy of KOH may be something else
entirely, but any software that marks sectors bad on my disks without
my permission automatically falls into the clssification of "unwanted"
or "bad" software.
 
Perhaps I don't understand or haven't familiarized myself enough with
this software, but it sounds ominously like some timebomb which
harbors the potential to hose the user at any given time.
 
IMHO, this sounds like badware, but I would have to examine it
further, under a debugger.

Firstly, by not jumping the gun.
 
Secondly, by examining the software extensively.
 
Thirdly, by making an honest analysis of its merits, its pitfalls and
its contentions.
 
All in all, if all it does is actively encrypt and compress, then it
is certainly non-threatening to the general public. If it does
otherwise, or has some odd caveats, the it needs to be advertised "up
front."
 
Now, don't get ne wrong -- I don't condone someone posting a debug
script on the net and saying "This may hose your system," knowing full
well that it will do exactly that!
 
Comments?
