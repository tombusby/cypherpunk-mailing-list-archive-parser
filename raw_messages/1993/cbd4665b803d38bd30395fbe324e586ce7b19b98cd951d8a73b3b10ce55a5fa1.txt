Hi everyone,

I am looking for any references or sources of information or code dealing w/
the use of images as a means of both transmission and encryption of plain-
texts.

Specificaly, I am interested in taking the 3 byte feild for each pixel in a
.gif and replacing the lsb w/ the bits in a 'plain-text'. This in effect
converts the image to a 'cypher-text'. The only real indication of a message
is the individual pixel brightness will be altered. However, unless you have
a source of known clean images there is little way to decode the messagr
reliably.

Right now we (a friend is helping work on it) are using the .gif galore CD as
our library of reference images. We eventualy hope to have a source of such
images available for all to access.

Any information or feedback would be appreciated (keep your flames to
yourself), thanks ahead of time!
