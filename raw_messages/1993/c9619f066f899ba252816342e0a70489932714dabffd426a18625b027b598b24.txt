From Risks 14.86 Aug 24 1993

This is a Spook Central meeting, so the topics given are interesting
`signal intelligence' on what's on the NSA^D^D^DNIST's mind at the moment. 
Also, it suggests what companies have active consulting & production 
arrangements with NSA (MITRE, Motorola, etc.).

What's on their mind: hierarchical security systems (antithetical to the
subversive PGP `web of trust'), distributed/network security, CLIPPER, 
`publishing work', (read: restrictions on cryptographic topics in journals?), 
`security requirements for cryptographic modules' (read: restrictions
on cryptographic device export?) `International harmonization' by a 
Frenchman (hehe, sounds a lot like `Ministry of Truth'), a probable codeword
for International Cryptographic Restriction.

Acronyms: TPEP, TTAP -- sound big, what are they? Some kind of U.S. 
government `evaluation paradigms'. Again, probably for crypto-device export.

Interesting presentations by spook outsiders & wannabes: virus attacks, 
`Security & Auditability of Electronic Voting Systems', `Privacy Impact 
of technology in 90's', `Electronic Crime Prevention & Investigation'

Hopefully, some patriotic cypherpunk can sneak in and smuggle out a report!
