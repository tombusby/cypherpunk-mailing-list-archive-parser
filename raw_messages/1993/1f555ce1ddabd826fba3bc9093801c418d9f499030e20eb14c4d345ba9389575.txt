Just because you lose physical possesion of your data, does
not have to mean you lose all control over it.

How about modifying the electronics in a pager to sit
on a disk drive card?  Call up the pager number to disable
the card or trigger the encryption or erasure of the
disk.  The caller might also give a password as a pager 
message.

Also, can we make an EMP emitter that hides inside a fake
3 1/4" "floppy"?  This would sit inside a box of floppies
and could also be triggered by pager.  Flash media.

Remote control has the following advantages:
	* Doesn't bother normal operations (eg having
	virus strings precluces normal checking for
	viruses, requiring a password or floppy key
	every time you log on is a pain, etc.)
	* Can be triggered after the raid has already
	taken place, if you didn't get advanced warning.

Has anybody done a marketing study for secure-computer
items like these ideas, CryptoStacker, etc?
