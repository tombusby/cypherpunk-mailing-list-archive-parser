other encrypted message was encrypted in."

Page 131:  Fifth paragraph.  "each capable of checking

256 million keys".

you can think of a as the remainder of b when divided
by n" should be "If a and b are positive and b is less
than n, you can think of b as the remainder of a when

Page 199:  Middle of the page.  In the sentence
"Calculating the power of a number modulo a number",

Page 229:  Fifth paragraph should read:  "For example,
assume that the input to the sixth S-box (that is, bits 31
through 36 of the XOR function) are 110010.  The first
and last bits combine to form 10, which corresponds to
row 3 of the sixth S-box.  The middle four bits
combine to form 1001, which corresponds to column 9
of the same S-box.  The entry under row 3, column 9
of S-box 6 is 0.  (Remember, we count rows and
columns from 0, and not from 1.)  The value 0000 is
substituted for 110010.

Page 238:  Last line before "Additional Results." 
"NSA" should be "IBM".

S_1 are incorrect.  See corrections from previous page.

should run from the symbol where Z_5 is multiplied
with the intermediate result to the addition symbol
directly to the right.

Page 306:  Fourth paragraph.  Delete the word
"cryptographers".

prime number 2^L bits long" should be "p = a prime
number L bits long".

Page 330:  Definitions of FF, GG, HH, and II.  In all
of them, "a = b +" should be "a = a +".

Page 347:  Second paragraph.  "(For example, m
should be chosen to be a prime number.)" should be
"(For example, c and m should be relatively prime.)"

Page 351:  Second line of text.  "they hold current"

A" and vice versa.  The second "a(t+n-1)" should be
"a(t+n)", and the second "b(t+n-1)" should be
"b(t+n)".

Page 365:  "Blum-Micali Generator."  In the equation,
"x_i" should be an exponent, not a subscript.

Page 391:  Second protocol, step (1).  "in his
implementation of DES" should be "in his
implementation of DSS".

Page 436:  "Pretty Good Privacy."  Third paragraph. 
Delete third sentence.

Page 437:  "Clipper."  Second paragraph:  foonote
should be "[473]".  Fourth paragraph:  footnotes should
