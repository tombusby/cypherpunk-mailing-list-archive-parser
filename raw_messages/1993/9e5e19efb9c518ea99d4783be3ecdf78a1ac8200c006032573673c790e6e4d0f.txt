FYI: there is a mailing list in place where developers/designers
are developing an Internet Mercantile Protocol.  This protocol
will enable buy/sell transactions to be conducted over an 
unsecure network, such as most of the Internet.  

You can subscribe to the list by sending a request to 
imp-interest-request@thumper.bellcore.com - archives are accessable
via FTP on thumper.bellcore.com in /pub/devetzis/imp.  Minutes
of the last BOF meeting are archived there as well as slides
for one proposed IMP implementation.  While there has not been
a ton of activity on this list recently, there are at least
two groups hard at work putting finishing touches on some
new proposals for the list to consider.
