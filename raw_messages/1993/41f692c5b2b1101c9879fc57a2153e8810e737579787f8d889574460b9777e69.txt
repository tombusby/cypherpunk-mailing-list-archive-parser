Call me paranoid, but I think the NSA has decided that sci.crypt is now a good spot to level propaganda.

The more I see statements like these, the more I suspect that the Clipper has a backdoor besides the key escrow systems.  I think the whole escrow issue is a decoy to getting a widespread NSA standard in place.  Also, keep in mind it could be the case that NSA builds different versions of the chips over time. How would we ever know?

This guy then goes on to propose a lot of bizarre international configurations of key escrow. Holy cow-- this guy is advocating *international* key escrow?

Good lord, cypherpunks, I wouldn't be surprised if Britain soon official endorses the Clipper. All our worst paranoia would be reality.  Consider it: the NSA and GCHQ have been in active collaboration ever since WWII and especially in recent years. This is all documented by Bamford.  What if Clipper is not just amenable to the NSA, but was also developed with British input?

I don't care if `the Agency' is happy or not. I think they would most definitely *not* be happy under such an arrangement and would use any significant Clipper entrenchment as torque to later ban alternative cryptographic schemes.


I'm growing desperately weary. I think the tidal wave is approaching.
