Tyrone Slothrop (RocketMan), you say:

> It's just words; they can't hurt you.

I think many people, nations, reputations, organization,
etc. have been destroyed by "just words." Somewhere I
heard the phrase: "The pen is mightier than the sword."
Words can and do hurt. I believe the practive of flaming
has probably hindered many people's participation and
contribution to discussions on the net. 

Some words that can hurt you:
 - death threats
 - "You're fired"
 - "I don't want to see you ever again."
 - "You're ideas are stupid; take them somewhere else."
 - "We see no option but to declare war!"
you get the idea.

Flaming is unproductive.
