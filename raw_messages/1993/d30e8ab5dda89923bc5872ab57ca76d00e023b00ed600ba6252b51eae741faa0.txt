Clearly; *right now* businesses are spending real money on it.

Uhhh, it's already happening.

Why does this preclude continuation of net services as they exist
today?  You seem to feel that there can only be one mode of use for
network resources.  If businesses want to use the net only under the
aegis of some authentication/credentialing scheme, fine!  That means I
may or may not choose too participate, or that I may choose to
participate as "myself" while still maintaining other digital
alter-egos for other purposes.

Why are you so stuck on the idea of "cleaning up a mess"?  The network
is a resource.  It can be used concurrently in lots of different ways.
You're free to start up your own set of authenticated services this
afternoon if you like.

Really?  So the presence of paying customers on the anarchic networks
won't be attractive?  We've had experience with lots of nasty problems
on the Internet already, and yet companies are all the time paying for
things like T1 channels for better service.

Of course, businesses are free as they've always been to implement
whatever communications systems they want.  This is old news.

Ok, fine.  So I pass if I want to and not if I don't.  What's the
point?  What does this have to do with being able to interact on other
net forums under different rules?

Yes, I'm vaguely familiar with the concept :-)

I think you're selling text short, but that's another discussion.

I'm aware of plenty of hype and pipe-dreams, but little reality.
Sure, it'd be neat though.  What does it have to do with
authentication and accountability?

That'd be nice, I guess, but what's the point?  Are you suggesting
that someone tapping the communication line wouldn't be able to (1)
figure out what you were "saying" and (2) spoof the system?  (If
neither, then what does this technology have to do with
authentication?)

Have you sent him PGP?  Seems a heck of a lot better and a heck of a
lot easier to implement.

 > Don't be surprised...

I'm losing track of what this has to do with "need" for
accountability.
