Why only "mass market" encryption?

The company I work for is developing a collection of runtime libraries and  
utilities which software developers can use to create and manage portable  
object-oriented distributed applications.  Think of it as a  
object-oriented DCE-like tool set with a run-time environment and system  
administration utilites.

Our customers are primarily large corporations, although it would be  
useful to small shops, too.  We have communication software that can  
perform encryption of user data, but the current export laws prevent us  
from placing this capability in versions for our foreign customers.   
<sigh>  We have to maintain two distinct versions of our product: a  
domestic version and and foreign version.

Since we target other software developers, I don't believe our product  
qualifies as "mass market" software.  At least, this is my interpretation  
of the definition of "as is" in the Cantwell bill:

Although we don't make custom versions of our software for specific  
customers, our software, due to its nature, is highly customizable by the  
purchaser.  Neither the Cantwell bill, nor the DPSWG letter mentions this  
type of software product.

As I see it, the main distinction between "mass market" software and our  
software is that our software is used to create other software, whereas  
"mass market" software implies final product "end-user" software.

My question to the DPSWG (and US Rep. Maria Cantwell, if I could e-mail  
her) is:

Why only "mass market" software?


Or put another way:

Does the DPSWG want the government to keep export controls in place for  
the type of product our company is developing?

Thanks,
