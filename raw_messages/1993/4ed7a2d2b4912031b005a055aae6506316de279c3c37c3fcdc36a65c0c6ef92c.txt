This is an excerpt from a LONG msg echoed to me by Dave Farber.  Though it's
from USIA -- not a police/enforcement agency -- it is nonetheless heavily
concerned with "terrorism", the theme repeatedly referenced in the White
House's Clipper Chip announcement.

I've included the first part down through the first article as an example,
and gave only the headlines of the remaining articles -- but you get the
idea.

Just FYI.  [And, no, I don't know where/how Dave got it electronically in the
first place.  :-)  ]

>In recent editorials, Iran was universally recognized as the source
>of the double threat of state-sponsored terrorism and Islamic
>extremism.  But beyond this fear and condemnation, journalists found
>little common ground that would compel both North and South, and Arab
>and non-Arab nations to work together to combat the global threat of
>terrorism.  For example, Egyptian and Algerian papers were in the
>forefront in charging U.S. complicity in the current instability in
>the Middle East.  Those commentators asserted that the United States
>had promoted Islamic fundamentalism during the Afghanistan War and
>had further added to regional instability by alternately encouraging

>India's papers weighed the pros and cons of helping the West to

>hand that doing so could "bring ruination to Islamabad's Kashmir
>cause" but, on the other, could also bring India's security apparatus
>uncomfortably close to the CIA and the Mossad.  Arab papers continued
>to portray Iraq and Libya as being unfairly treated by the UN while
>Israel remains unpunished for resolutions which it has violated.
>
>Concerning Northern Ireland, President Clinton's message of
