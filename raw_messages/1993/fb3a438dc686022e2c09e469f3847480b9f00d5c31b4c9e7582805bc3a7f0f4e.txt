Why doesn't Tim and anyone else who suspects that they have reached
the much-sought status of "superhacker on gov't files not just write
to their local friendly federal government office and ask for a copy
of their own records?

As far as I know, the US freedom of information act allows anyone access
to information about them that has been stored by the government. (I'm
not a laywer and not even a US resident so don't quote me on any of this;
but then I'm not charging legal fees either.)

Of course any interesting information they've got is likely to be classified,
but at least you'll find out whether any such information is stored on the
files.

Of course, requesting your own government file is likely to draw attention
to yourself, so it's probably best not to do so unless you're sure that 
they already know that you know-that-they-know-something.
