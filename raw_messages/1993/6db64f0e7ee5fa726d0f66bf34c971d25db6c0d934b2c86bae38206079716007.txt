These things you're talking about were in fact done by the "armchair
commandoes" you disparage here. Which is it, action or talk of action?
Or perhaps both? Sounds good to me.

Comments about Ingle's likely exposure to investigation at the least
and prosecution at the worst are just facts of life. We don't have to
agree with the actions of the Feds, just make note of likely actions.

P.S. Using all caps makes you like a detweilering raver. I'm sure
you're not, but this is the effect.
