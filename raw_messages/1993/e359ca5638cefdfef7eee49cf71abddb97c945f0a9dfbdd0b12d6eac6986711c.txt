Title:     Hackers switch sides, offer security package. (includes
           related article on the VinCrypt data security application)
           (Product Announcement)
Author:    Daly, James
 
 
Abstract:  Notorious computer hackers introduce their $159 VinCrypt
           encryption package, which enhances data security.  The
           DOS-based application has been created by highly skilled
           underground systems programmers.  Co-developer Ian Murphy,
           who is president of Secure Data Systems Inc, also will
           distribute the application.  He indicates that VinCrypt
           has not gained the approval of any government agency, but
           he does not seek government approval.  Murphy believes that
           data encryption packages based on the Data Encryption
           Standard or RSA Data Security Inc's standards are not secure
           because their basic algorithms have been given to the
           National Security Agency. VinCrypt's source code will not
           be passed around, but some experts suggest that it then will
           be difficult to evaluate the package's real security
           effectiveness.
