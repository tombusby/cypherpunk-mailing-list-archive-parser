  This is why I think you need psychological help. Either you're a 
hypersensitive wimp, or you've got no life outside the net. Use your
intelligence: I am sitting at a terminal a thousand miles away and
I jokingly refer to shooting you and you become emotionally upset.
No one else is as obsessed with pseudospoofing as you simply because 
speech over the net doesn't have so much an impact on us as they seem
to you.

  I'm coming to kill your family tommorow with a rusty razor.

  So? If the majority of people will use pseudonyms honestly, why should
they be punished for the few who are malicious?

  The same arguments you make against multiple-nyms are the very same
arguments that can be made against strong crypto and for CLIPPER. Clipper
isn't Draconian either and can argubly benefit society by making it easier
for the FBI to catch criminals. What's your idealogical opposition to it
then?

  I dare you to present your "identification system" I want to see the
specifications on how it will work, and how you can oppose nyms and
reject clipper/skipjack and maintain a consistent philosophy. I don't
think you know what the hell you are talking about except for some
vague utopian ideals you have. Come on, where are those algorithms?

  Why do you think I am concerned with the liberation of the universe?
Actually, I'm concerned with MY liberation. Why do you believe that
I care what any fiction author thinks? I make my own decisions and
my own opinions and I don't care what Vinge thinks. I like his
books, but that doesn't mean I have to agree with his real life philosophy.
You're yet another leftist wacko who thinks you can prove theories
through fictional story book worlds. Next you're be telling us that
Bladerunner is proof of why we shouldn't progress with Biotechnology.

  If it took you a year and you still got it wrong, I think you should
be consigned to elementary school. You're obviously a product of our
EVIL and TREACHEROUS public school system screwups.
