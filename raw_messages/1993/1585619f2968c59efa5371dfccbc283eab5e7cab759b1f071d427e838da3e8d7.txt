     Internet messages pertaining to ViaCrypt(tm) PGP(tm) have
been very positive but somewhat overwhelming.  With dozens of
messages received by Phil and passed on to ViaCrypt, this general
response will have to suffice until we can get back with more
personalized messages.

     First, ViaCrypt (a division of 17-year-old Lemcom Systems,
Inc.) presently has a PKP patent sublicense for its line of
DigiSig+(tm) software and hardware cryptographic engines.  By
using ViaCrypt's licensed DigiSig+ software cryptographic engine
for the RSA technology, and marrying it to most of the PGP code,
we will produce a totally compatible and legal commercial product
which is called ViaCrypt PGP.

     Second, there is a little work required before we can start
shipping.  Most significantly, PGP is being modified to
substitute the DigiSig+ cryptographic engine in the ViaCrypt PGP
product.  With the more generalized interface of the DigiSig+
cryptographic engine, ViaCrypt PGP may run slightly slower than
PGP but otherwise you won't notice any difference.  ViaCrypt will
attempt to minimize any performance differences in future
releases.

     ViaCrypt's patent sublicense from PKP only permits object
code to be distributed.  That may create uneasiness for some
people, but is necessary to market ViaCrypt PGP.

     Following are excerpts from the press release for ViaCrypt
PGP dated 3 September 1993:

     "ViaCrypt PGP will be available in object code for the DOS 
environment in early November, 1993.  ViaCrypt intends to make
the program available on a wide range of additional platforms. 
UNIX versions will soon follow.  To provide a high degree of
interoperability, the company expects to announce a Windows
version, Macintosh version, and ports to several other platforms
in 1994.

     ViaCrypt PGP for DOS prices are $199.95 for a single user
license, $599.95 for a five user license, and $1,649.95 for a 20
user license.  Shipping and handling are extra.  As an
introductory promotional offer, these prices are discounted 50%
for orders received through the end of 1993.  Multiple-user
licenses for 50 or more are also available from ViaCrypt.  Prices
for ViaCrypt PGP on other platforms may vary and will be          
established at announcement time."
