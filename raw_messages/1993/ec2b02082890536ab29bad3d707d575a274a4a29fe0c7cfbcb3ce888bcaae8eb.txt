I apologize for this, but...
If anyone sent me a response re:pgp help, i just lost my incoming mailbox
before i read my mail.  I did see a few responses listed in my new mail,
but they were gone when i tried to read them.  Sorry for the hassle, but
could anyone who did send me something re-send it?  I am not too happy
about all my lost mail.
