 Point taken, however there will be those who will argue that, "S & M
 has no business being discussed on the net in the first place." Not
 exactly my sentiment, but you know the spiel. That type  of
 "Stalinist dictatorship" mentality inherently exists in every nook and
 cranny of society, including the nets.
 
 My original post was not issued as a challenge, but merely a question
 to gauge some of the responses and justifications I hoped to receive.

 Cheers.
