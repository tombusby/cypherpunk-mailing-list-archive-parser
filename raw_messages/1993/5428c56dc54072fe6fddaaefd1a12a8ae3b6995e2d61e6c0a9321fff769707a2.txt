It could make sense.  It would make _practical_ sense in a scheme  
like the one I proposed (then amended thanks to John Gilmore's  
comments) in which the remailer encrypts the return addresses with a  
key that is regularly changed.  Just forget the old keys after a  
certain amount of time.   


(BTW, forget I ever said anything about using timestamps as salt.   
The amount of known-plaintext per message is huge if you do that.   
Any PRNG would be better.  I must have left my brain at home  
yesterday...)
