Since Moby Crypto is, as I understand it, composed of material which is
generally available all over the world, it may not be necessary that it
be exported from the U.S. in order to exist in a foreign country.  One should
be careful about accusing others of conspiracy to violate the ITARs, even
qualifying it with "in essence".

The note that Steve is referring to is presumably this.  Note the date:

I think the relative timing of this announcement and the subpoena makes
it questionable whether the subpoena was in response to this posting.
According to Ward's later post:

This is two days after Ward's message, which is pretty fast response
for law enforcement.  But this is the date of service.  The subpoena
had to be issued and signed before this.  Did that occur after Ward's
Sep 14 posting?  It's not 100% clear, but what the subpoena itself, as
posted by Grady, says is:

> This subpoena is issued on application of the United States of America
> Michael J. Yamaguchi
> United States Attorney
>  
> Assistant U.S. Attorney
> William P. Keane
> 280 S. First St., Suite 371
> San Jose, CA  95113
> (408) 291-7221
> s/a Robin Sterzer, Customs
> 93-1348(SJ) 93-1(SJ)
>  
> 9 September 1993

If Sep 9 is the date on which the subpoena was actually issued, this was
five days before Grady Ward's post which supposedly triggered the subpoena.
Unless the Feds are prescient, they must have been planning to subpoena
Austin Code Works about Moby Crypto, PGP, and RSA long before Ward's post.
