wow, much to disagree with in that paragraph.  tell you what, though.  since
you have such faith in the bloodhounds of the justice system, why don't you
post your home phone number here and invite a test of the efficacy of those
tangible clues etc.?

i haven't a clue, tangible or otherwise, how you would trace a carefully
plotted campaign of harrassment, whether by phone or postal mail.  perhaps
you could elaborate?
