 I'll be there Saturday -- all of you should know by now that (at
 least for the time being) I'm out-of-town on Mondays (and every
 other weekday).
 
 Also, I just read a message announcing the Boston (Cambridge) area
 meeting tomorrow as well, along with mention of an electronic
 conference call to the west coast group.
 
 See you there.
 
 Cheers.
