However if they forged your name on one of your checks, you wouldn't
take such a blase attitude to it would you?

And in such a case you have an opprtunitty to prosecute them for
their criminal act of forgery should you be able tpo prove it.

Digital signature systems need to include the ability to track and
succesfully prosecute criminal
forgery, or digital signatures are worthless for transactiuons
that require reliable accountability.

What makes you think that the bleak vision of the future reflected in your
satire above isn't exactly what the typical power/control-freak government
types want to impose?

right, so where are the systems that certify trust and authenticity?
and who is designing them ,
and what are the design criterea,
and what happens if the government decides they don't want to,
and.....
