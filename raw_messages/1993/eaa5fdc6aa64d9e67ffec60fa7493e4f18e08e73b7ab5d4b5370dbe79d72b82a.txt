Depends how you define harmless. If I recall the original e-mail release
correctly, they do archive all messages. No assurances are made that these
messages will not be used against you (ie- might end up in some file on
you; I doubt that it would be used in court).

To reenforce Perry's point: Any threats against the Prez or his clan WILL
get forwarded to the secret service, so DON'T pull that one. Death threats
are useless (and most likely counter-productive) tactics anyway.

But writing letters to that address are probably at least as effective as
writing to him via US Snail. Keep the message focused on one idea (remember
it will probably be tabulated as for or against an issue) and make sure
that  the message gets across clearly.

Who knows, if a enough messages get through on a subject, Bill or Al might
get a one line statement in one of there meetings saying that the online
community is "up in arms" about skipjack or the pgp subpoenas.
