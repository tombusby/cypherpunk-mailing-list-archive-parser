I've gotten a few requests already for info on the book I mentioned. 

I usually avoid giving ISBN numbers for folks to order a book sight
unseen--if they're going to spend $50-70 for a book, they at least
ought to flip through it in person and see if they really want it.

(Sidenote: Must be the electronic age...often when I mention a paper
on something, I get notes asking me where it's available online! I
admire these Net-dwellers (no relation to Detweiler!), but the fact is
that most of the good stuff is only in print. The reasons are many.)

Anyway, here's the EDM info:

For $59, a real bargain. But if you don't have a fairly good crypto
library (Schneier, especially, and perhaps Denning, Salomaa, Brassard,
Simmons, etc.), then you'd probably do better to get some of them
first.
