Many people use local check cashing stores to cash pay checks and
buy money orders.  Money orders are particularly useful when you
want to retain some level of privacy when purchasing things like
dirty magazines, subversive literature, etc.

There are currently two bills in the House that may force these
businesses to close.  HR 1448 and HR 3235.  I don't have the
text of these bills, but some of the check cashing stores in
my 'hood are asking customers to write their Hon. Misrepresentative
immediately and ask them to block these bills.

Does anyone have access to the text of these bills?
