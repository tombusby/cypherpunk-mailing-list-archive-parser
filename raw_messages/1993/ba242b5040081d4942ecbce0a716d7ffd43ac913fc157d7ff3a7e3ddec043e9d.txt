If you look in this directory you will find pgp sigs for the files by the
uploading individuals. I do not have access to every type of computer, thus
I queried on cypherpunks approximately 5 weeks (I think) for binary submissions.
The unix versions have individual sigs as you can see, as to the dos, this is
the original shipping material, I have not looked inside since I rely on Unix
myself. The Mac version was picked up from soda.berkeley.edu, as I understand
it sigs are included within the compactor pro archive. The os2 version is
in the same boat as dos. As for the amiga version, I am at a loss I do not
have access to an amiga, but viewing the archive a signature is apparently not
attached. I will try to find out who I received the file from as I currently
do not remember. I would like everyones opinion though. I thought that offering
binaries from sources I considered secure was a good idea. I understand the
inherent danger in not compiling the source yourself, but.... not everyone
knows how to compile. What is the list's opinion. Is this a bad idea? Improper?
