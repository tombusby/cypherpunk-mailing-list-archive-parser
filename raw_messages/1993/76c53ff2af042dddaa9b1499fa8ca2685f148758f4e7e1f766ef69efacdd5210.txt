Please pardon the wide cross-posting (some of which are actually mailing
lists), but all of these newsgroups involve issues with which EFF deals, and
we hope the readers of these groups will support EFF's BBS project.

EFF needs to set up a bulletin board system, to be called "Outpost - EFF
Online", to help spread the word to people in the BBS community, most of
whom do not have access to the resources of the net, on:

cryptography   privacy   activism    civil liberities online    networking

national information infrastructure   open platform principles  censorship

laws that affect computer users   ITAR restrictions    telco/cable mergers

internet access       many-to-many communication       virtual communities

cyberspace      digital telephony       bbs seizures      online resources

and more...


WHAT WE NEED:

We need donations of funds and equipment.  We already have BBS software
(Digital Dynamics has donated their Synchronet BBS package), but still need
a platform to run it on, including basic PC system, modems, tape backup, 
monitor, hard drive, etc.

If you'd like to contribute to this project, please contact mech@eff.org
(Stanton McCandlish, EFF Online Activist/SysOp, 202-347-5400 voice, 
202-393-5509 fax,  EFF - 1001 G St. NW, Ste. 950 E, Wash. DC 20001)

All donations are tax deductable, and any donations of funds or hardware worth
$40 or more will get the contributor a one-year membership in EFF.  
All contributors will be listed in a "thank you" note in an upcoming Effector
Online (EFF's electronic newsletter), and permanently on the BBS itself.
Great advertising!

Thanks for reading, and thanks for your assistance!
