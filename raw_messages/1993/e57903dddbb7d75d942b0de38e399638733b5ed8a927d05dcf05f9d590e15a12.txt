I call it a network operating system designed to cope with local security
breaches.  I am not required by law to keep business records in any
particular jurisdiction.  I am not even required to have access to
everything in a business with which I am connected.
 
>>>such a charge might be preferrable to one of Sedition :-)<<<
 
But a charge of Sedition is such a rare honor.  It's tough to get the Feds
to bring one.  One Sedition trial during WWII and one against White
Supremicists a few years back.  Feds lost both.  Besides, if the system is
run by non-Americans outside of the US, sedition can't apply (can it? - no
treason certainly).
