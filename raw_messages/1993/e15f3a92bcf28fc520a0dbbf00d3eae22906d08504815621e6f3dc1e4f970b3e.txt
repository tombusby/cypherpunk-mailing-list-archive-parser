Okay, here comes a test case.  Can enough copies of PGP and other decent
crypto get circulating in Norway, and posted on public-accessible terminals
(in bookstores and so on, perhaps with an attendant or coinbox to cover
telephone charges), and posted on every university machine and anywhere else
that seems useful, to prevent the Clipper-or-else law from being passed...?

If it passes, are there enough people willing to do civil disobedience to
get the law overturned in the courts...?  

Precedent is contagious.  Even internationally.  If the nasties get away
with it over there, it's just an incentive for their colleagues everywhere
else to try more of same.  

Does anyone here know the status of the crypto scene over there, in terms of
how many people involved, how many using good crypto, how many will hop on
the bandwagon if things get worse...?
