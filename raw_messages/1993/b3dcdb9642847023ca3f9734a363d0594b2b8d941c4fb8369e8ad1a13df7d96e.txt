Matthew,

As a fresh newbie allow me to react for the record to your recent post.

>a "safe and fun environment" to introduce new people to anything. 

I've never found a safe and fun environment anywhere, anytime if I looked
closely enough to see what was going on; hence I never expect it anywhere,
anytime.

My questions have been answered graciously, thoroughly, and when I've been
corrected, I should've been due to inattentive typing (e.g., author's
names).

Movement? Like in 'bowel'? I don't see the elitest approach; from my
perspective it looks like people with knowledge being exasperated when
others want private tutoring and don't RTFM. I'm pretty much the same way
in my areas of expertise.

Let me get this straight -- you're claiming property rights to spontaneous
behavior of other individuals?

It's been good for me. Why do you think that might be?
