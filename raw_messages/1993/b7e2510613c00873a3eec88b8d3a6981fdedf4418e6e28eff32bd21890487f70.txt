*> The Capitalization of the Internet. And I thought it was gonna come from the
*> outside. All this talk of AT&T or TCI buying parts of the net and eventually
*> kicking those who won't pay exorbinate prices (that is the nightmare, right>)
*> off the Internet (or the DataHighway, as it will then be called) is just dust
*> in the wind compared to what this Eric guy is planning.
*> 
*> Actually, his idea isn't that bad. It would certainly help those shareware
*> developers to earn some dough and us Authors could get a few pennies for our
*> words. It won't be too long before somebody thinks they have information that
*> people would be willing to pay for. They'll set up an email list and you'll
*> have to pay to be on it. Clarinews will make more money. The Electronic Zines
*> can recover some costs, and even the OTIS gallery could collect some dues.
*> Soon it will become obvious who has the capital to control the net's
*> information (my bet is on Bill Gates), and a new hierarchy based on the old
*> hierarchy of capitalism will soon run the Internet. (this is of course a bleak
*> vision, but I haven't been given reason to think otherwise.)
