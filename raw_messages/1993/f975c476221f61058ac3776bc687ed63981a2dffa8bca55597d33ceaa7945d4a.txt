   can you provide a citation?  i recently read a paper Shannon wrote [1] on
   a study of randomness in english text, and this is definitely not the 
   impression i got from it.

   in this study Shannon demonstrates that english-speaking humans are very
   capable of predicting the next letter of an unknown text given the letters
   up to that point (he also shows this for the reverse direction; that is,
   starting at the end of the text and working forward, subjects were almost
   as capable of predicting correctly as they were starting from the front of
   the text).  this seems to imply that there is some non-random relationship
   (statistical or otherwise) among the letters in a text.  might this
   redundancy be carried over into any encoding (MD5 hash, e.g.) of the text?

   theoretically, at least, this may compare to Vigne're ciphers; the key
   is based on some text other than the plaintext.

<  at least 128 characters of source language.  For a larger random number,
<  you can concatenate multiple MD5 values from multiple pieces of source text.

   could someone here describe how this compares to other pseudo-random sources?
   how well would this function as a seed to some other pseudo-random number
   generation process?
