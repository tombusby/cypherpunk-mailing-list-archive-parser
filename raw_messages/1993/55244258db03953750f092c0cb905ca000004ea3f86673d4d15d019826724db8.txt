Well, let's start by saying that fo%bar@blach addresses are pretty error
prone, as there are a lot of brain-damaged mailers out there. Much safer
to use the X-Anon-To: header for this kind of stuff. See the help file
from help@anon.penet.fi for more info.

Secondly, currently anon.penet.fi strips off PGP messages and signature
blocks. I am going to fix the .sig stripper Real Soon Now....

Thirdly, I notice a lot of mailers get "From:" and "Sender:" (or
envelope) addresses screwed up. Anon.penet.fi puts the anon id in the
"From:" field, but makes "Sender:" point to the anon admin, to catch
mail bounces that might reveal the true identity of an anon id. I don't
know how pax.tpa.com.au handles this....

I'll check on those id's tomorrow. It's 11pm out here, and I have a
specification to finish for a meeting tomorrow morning....
