I had a nice long message composed in response, explaining my own
circumstances, but on review, it's clear that I can't explain
without revealing personal information, threatening exposure.
Sorry.

But use your imagination.  There are plenty of uses, such as speaking
out and whistle blowing, and cypherpunks are interested in anonymous
digital economies, so running a nym is good for practice.  If you
listen to some cypherpunks, there are research questions, too.
