Cell systems have to know which cell you're in (visualize each cell as
a circle centered on the cell site) to know how to route a call _to_
you. I believe the MTSO (== cellular CO) will route the call directly
to the cell site for the cell you're in.

Of course, the cell will also know what cell you're in when you
originate a call. This knowledge is useful for traffic analysis, but
it's also required for the system to be able to route incoming and
outgoing calls.

An alternative is the ham packet radio-style addressing of
user@node@node..., where "user" represents the call sign of the
intended receiver and each node represents the call of a digipeater
between the sender and recipient. The hard part here is that you must
be able to dynamically generate a route between Alice and Bob if
either of them move from their last known location.

Of course, there's always store-and-forward. A spread-spectrum network
of small digipeaters, combined with crypto remailing and pool
software, would really be something. I'm not sure that it would work
well for spread-spectrum SLIP, though.
