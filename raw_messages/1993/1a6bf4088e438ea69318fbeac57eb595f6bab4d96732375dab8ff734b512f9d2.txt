While I was reading though _Applied Cryptography_ last night, a thought
struck me (no damage):  Why hasn't anyone come up with a good Mac or PC based
One-Time Pad system.  I'd envision it working something like this:

   * A 1.4 Meg floppy with a single file, or multiple files, of random bits.
     2 copies, one for sender and one for reciever.

   * The first few bytes of the cyphertext file will contain the name of
     the pad file used, possibly the volume name where the pad file is
     stored, and the starting offset within the pad file.

It seems like this would be a fairly easy system to implement, but since
no one (to my knowledge) has yet done so, there must be something I'm
missing. :-)  Secure distribution and storage of the pad disk could be
difficult, but not insurmountable. The only hurdle that comes to mind is that
filling a 1.4 meg floppy, or even a 700k floppy, with a sequence of TRULY
random bits might be difficult and/or very time consuming.  Any thoughts?
