Hm.. 1 tape a week at 52week/year, gives 520 8mm tapes, assuming
they can process one tape every 30minutes, thats nearly 11 days.

Proably will take about 1 to 2 hours a tape, just to read through
the stuff.  You are talking about thousands of dollars of cost
to do such a search.  Then someone has to weed out all of the other
"Doe, John" messages that were not you.
Considering most business don't bother to verify references, and those
that do still usually only check employment history.

Once again your are offered a limited protection by the volume of
information.  Usenet traffic being rated at some 21gigabytes a year
(traffic through UUnet) considering the low information value
of the vast majority of it, no one will be interested in storing it.

In usenet no one can hear you scream...
