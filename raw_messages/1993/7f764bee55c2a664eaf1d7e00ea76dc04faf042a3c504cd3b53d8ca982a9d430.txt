   Well (2) is untrue since I know people who can forge signatures with
great precision (even my own).

   Since we're going for an ideal Brave New Cyberspace where forging
ids is impossible, I've got some suggestions. These should make you very
happy:

 1) Phase out handwritten signatures in society and switch to finger prints,
retinal scan, and DNA codes. Whenever you sign anything, the store/business/
govt office will require a blood test (for DNA), retina scan, and finger
print. With today's technologies, these can be made painless and quick.

 2) Require everyone to have a global positioning tracker installed under the
skin so they are "accountable" at all times. This worked great in
demolition man.

 3) Mandatory caller-id, video-id for everyone. No one should be able to
make calls without the other person knowing who you really are. Payphones
should have finger print/retinal scanners for verification.

 4) all new computers should come equipped with finger print recognizing
keyboards. No more spoofed messages posted on people who leave their terminals
accidently logged in (in the computer lab)

 5) get rid of cash! we can't have unaccountable transactions taking place
in the economy. Banish the free market. Nationalize all businesses under
NSA control.

   Get a clue for god's sake. Digital signatures won't exist in a vacuum.
No one is going to accept the validity of a signature unless it is signed by
some trusted/certified authority and that authority would be liable for the
person's true name or actions.

   This is exactly how Apple's new DSA system works.

   I'm starting to think someone is pseudospoofing you because your posts
have become so idiotic it reads like a satire. Are you really the same
person who wrote the anonymity faq?
