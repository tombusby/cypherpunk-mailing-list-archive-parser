I have replied to several 'please subscribe me' posts over the last few
days, explaining how to contact Eric and get on the list. Looking over
the free-for-all of the past several days, I could see where newcomers
to the list would think this is the norm, rather than (hopefully) a 
passing phase. 

Did I attach a motive to your post? No.
Did I make any comment about your motives? No.
Did I hit a nerve? Looks like it.

The 'Enough!' post was intended to point out how inappropriate this latest
round of character assassination has become. I should not have included
the specific instance of the knife/gun message without also mentioning
the use of the term 'detweilering', which is another example of the same
phenomenon. For that, I apologize. Quoting that specific case makes it
look like I'm hammering that particular author, and that was not my intent.
(I've forgotten who posted that one anyway- unlike the legendary S. Boxx,
I haven't got the file space to keep my mail forever).
 
At any rate, be assured that I did not intend to single you out.
