Yes, and Phil Zimmermann asked essentially the same thing, though the
number of folks aware of these issues was much lower back then....and
groups like ours did not even exist then.

But when the CryptoNarcs want to go after someone for illegal export
of crypto munitions (PGP, SecureDrive, etc.), they are not overly
impressed with "wink wink, don't export this, wink, wink" caveats.

If Zimmermann gets indicted and if SecureDrive ends up on an offshore
ftp site, I expect Mike Ingle will at least get subpoenaed to testify
and produce his records, and will possibly be indicted as well.

That's the way I see it.
