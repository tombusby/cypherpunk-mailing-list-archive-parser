First off, thanks to all the people who replied to my first post.  Which, as
it turns out needs a bit of clarifying.
 
I am looking for a secure information system for hospital administration.
My mother is on the purchasing committee at her place o' employment (she
is a Registered Nurse) and asked me some questions about their nascent
search for a new information system.
 
They are considering three operating systems all put on 3090's i believe.
They are considering CICS, AIX and something merely labeled propietary (UNIX?).
Well, I am visceraly familiar with the first two and know of several security
problems with both systems.
 
So, when I read on in her literature I found mention of security.  All that it
said was individual users have individual passwords!  HELLO! I immideatly
told her that there was or would be a problem.  AIX out-of-box is horribly
insecure as is any CICS implementation i have seen.  I was/am concerned
about the probability of a breach.
 
So, my cryptoQuestion is based around *any* possible/existing medical info-
rmation protocals in existance.  I would prefer a cryptographic protocol,
thus my appeal to the list.  If none exist, then industrious punks can make
a bundle by creating one (Oh yeah! We do write code when were not hissing at
Medusa's Head!).
 
Otherwise, I may simply piece together a package from that which already
exists.  Punks, I must say it is sad to see the state of information
security with regard to Medical Information.
