Subject: REMAIL: sendmail invocation

I just adjusted the sendmail invocation in the remailer scripts on
menudo to include the -oi option ("/usr/lib/sendmail -oi ").  This
option tells sendmail to not treat a period on a line by itself as the
end of input.

(I remember having fun posting a message where I showed forging a
usenet post - my post had such a line, and the rest of the message
kept on getting truncated.  Miron brought the -oi option to our
attention!)

However, it just occured to me that this is a simple, if unplanned,
way for people who have signatures automatically appended to messages
to use a remailer and have trailing lines cut!  No fancy "cut here"
marks for the scripts to recognize, let sendmail do the work!

On the other hand, I plan to not use sendmail in the long run.  I plan
to upgrade to an smtp package (hopefully to avoid logging like syslog)
sent to me by Peter Honeyman, so I'm going to leave the sendmail
invocation with -oi.
