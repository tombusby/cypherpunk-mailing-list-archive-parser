This is being worked on....

This has been in PGP since version 2.2!  Read the docs!  To use this
feature, you just execute:

	pgp -e filename user1 user2 user3...

And it will encrypt the file to all users, using the same IDEA key and
RSA-encrypting it to the different recipients.

This has been discussed.  It is possible to do this in the PGP
protocol, but it has not been implemented.  What this means is that
you could write the code to generate the proper packets to do this,
since those packets are legal, but this code has not yet been written.
It is in the works, but I wouldn't expect to see it in the 2.4
version.

This, too, is in the works, albeit a little more difficult to
accomplish.

This is already supported.  There is a byte that represents the
secret-key algorithm (and there is a byte that represents the
message-digest algorithm as well).  It would be simple to add, say,
triple-DES to PGP as an alternative encryption algorithm.  As for
hiding the encryption algorithm, this is a possibility but I don't see
it happening.  The data structures, I don't believe, allow for this
currently.  (I'd have to go back and double check this one).

Thats why this message was composed.  Enjoy!
