ACK!  My mailbox has been so backlogged that I read this message a month late!
*Did* anyone tape the show?  I'd really like a copy...maybe to replay on the
radio at WCNI (New London, 91.1) if it's really good (if that's o.k....?)...

If someone has a tape, please let me know at mrnoise@econs.umass.edu, or if
you're feeling both ambitious & altruistic, please mail a copy to me at P.O.
Box 109, Bozrah, CT...I'll mail you back $$ for the tape & postage.  Thanks in
advance for any help on this one...
