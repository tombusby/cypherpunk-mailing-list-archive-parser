If you use DES, you are just using a variation of DES in cipher
block chaining mode.  If you use some other hash function, your
cipher is as weak as the hash function.  If you use key bytes
directly to XOR with, and never reuse key material, you have a
variation of the one time pad (which is good, but takes LOTS of
key material).  If you reuse key material when XORing it directly,
you have a weak cipher vulnerable to a known plain text attack.

There is nothing really new here...

For more info on this, if you have a PC and a modem, you can call
a BBS at 303-938-9654, download CRYPTMPJ.ZIP, and read THESIS.DOC
in that file.  Perhaps one of you could put this file at an ftp
site for wider distribution?  The stuff in that file about data
compression is kind of out of date, but the cryptographic
information (including some source code) might be of interest to
some others in this group.
