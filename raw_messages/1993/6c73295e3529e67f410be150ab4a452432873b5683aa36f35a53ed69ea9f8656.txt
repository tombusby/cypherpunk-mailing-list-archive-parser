Of course they have to be able to prove that you did so.  Cash cards raise

However, by spreading the "importation" out over time, cash cards reduce 
the chances that a "structuring" count could be proved against you.  The 
whole cash card thing really mixes up the exact location of the money.  
What if you are overseas and buy a VISA USA cash card and then bring it 
into the US.  Is this a reportable transaction?  Presumably the payment 
for the card was wired by your overseas institution to VISA USA, a bank 
wire is not reportable.  In any case, the overseas institution may not 
link you with its purchase of a VISA Cash Card from the US.

Complications.
