You use a known source of material. For example, here's one way you
could easily distribute messages to a wide audience using
off-the-shelf tools.  

1. Buy one of the many porno CD-ROMs. Pick one which is fairly
widespread and to which your source will also have access (i.e. if
you're in Denmark, don't choose a child porno CD to communicate with
someone in the US.) Of course, audio or other types of data CDs will
work here too.

2. Make _prearranged_ changes to your source file: convert JPEG->GIF,
or apply a Gaussian blur- whatever suits your fancy.
 
3. XOR in your message text.

4. Post to Usenet,  indicating the source of the materials (i.e. "This
picture came from `Girls of The Rural South, vol 1'" or "Audio sampled
from Michael Jackson's _Dangerous_")

Step 1 insures that your recipient will have access to the same source
material. Step 2 helps mask your message by introducing _other_
differences between the step 1 source and the transmitted message.
Step 4 gives you an easy, safe, distributed transmission medium.

Repeat as necessary.
