My previous message to cypherpunks, the one which had
subject heading "AT&T" and which began:
"I recently switched my long distance carrier from AT&T to another,
since they bribed me to do so with an offer of $35."
seemed to be posted OK (it apparently came back to me as expected)
but I also got this funny bounce message:

This seems odd.  What's going on?  Do all messages with "AT&T" in the
subject line get siphoned off somewhere for review?  Did this one
generate a bounce message because the account of Bryan Petty, AT&T spy,
wasn't receiving tonight?  OK, I'm just paranoid.  (Paranoia - that's
your state of mind when you finally realize what's really going on.)
