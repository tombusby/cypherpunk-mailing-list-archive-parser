 I went back through my archives and read this message; actually the
 context in which it was written could be construed that "we"
 is either party (NSA or Cypherpunks).
 
 After re- reading the remainder of his (or her) post, I think he's
 right for the most part. Messages containing hype (like yours, that
 I told myself I wasn't going to respond to) consist of much more
 paranoia than substance.
