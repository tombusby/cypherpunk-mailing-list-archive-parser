Potential First Amendment problems with an encryption ban --
 
Let's assume that the Clinton administration bans non-Clipper encryption
technology.
 
I then transmit the following and am arrested --

Won't the prosecution be embarrassed when I decrypt it in court and present
the plaintext:
 
      1st Amendment
      Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
      religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging
      the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the
      people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for
      a redress of grievances.
 
 
I don't see how the mere fact of encryption itself fits a message into one of
the 1st amendment exceptions -- pornography, national security, libel, etc.
 
Since it is easy to establish in information theory that a cyphertext is a
form of *information* itself and not just a *means* of transmitting the
information contained in the plaintext, outlawing the encryption of plaintext
because the algorithm is unapproved is classic censorship of a writing
*because* of its content.
 
Additionally, there are several types of communications that cannot legally be
wiretapped.  These would include lawyer-client and husband-wife as well as
certain others.  Since the privacy of these communications requires that you
make an effort to keep them private, you could argue that in these cases the
use of secure encryption is legally required.
 
The crypto-fascists have used these sorts bluffs ever since the late 1920s
when someone was discouraged from publishing a history of the State
Department's code office.  The NSA also threatened to lock up the developers
of the RSA encryption system if they published "A Proposal for a Public Key
Encyption System" in the Proceedings of the IEEE in 1977.  They published
anyway and are still walking around.
 
Don't let them bluff anyone again.  It is neither legally nor technically
possible to ban secure cryptography.
