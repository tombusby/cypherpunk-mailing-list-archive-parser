I think Greg is right on the money here. The first time someone complained to
my sysadmin (me), I'd send that person a sorrowful note apologizing for the
nasty-icky behaviour prompting the complaint and assuring the complainer that
the offending user on my system (also me) would have his account cancelled
immediately.

Then, I'd go back to living my life as I please.  :)

Seems to me that this approach would guarantee accountability on my system
and keep everyone happy.
