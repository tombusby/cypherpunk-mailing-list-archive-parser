an eternity ago in cyberspatial time (a few days ago in real time) P.
Wayner posted some comments about the latest CSSPAB meeting. He hasn't
appeared to have gotten any direct feedback on the list to that report,
which I think is a pity, because he's one of the few cypherpunk
`infiltrators' not only consistently attending important national
government meetings, but conscientiously reporting them on the list
(which involves a significant amount of labor) often to no reward but
flames! (there's been quite a bit of indirect reaction to the `software
Skipjack CRADA proposal he illuminated.) Anyway, my personal thanks!

Cypherpunks, its in these kinds of reports that very important clues of
future NSA directions are buried, and I'll start off with a gem:

`other countries'? `Common Criteria'? holy cow, this is something *very
big* in the works. The U.S. can barely figure out its *own*
cryptographic policies, and imagine the sheer logistical nightmare of
trying to come to an agreement between the most isolated and imperious
agencies! I suspect GCHQ (Britain's NSA) would be involved in this at
least. (There is a very cozy relationship between NSA and GCHQ that
Kahn was harassed for revealing in _CodeBreakers_.)What other agencies?

Mr. GraveDigger, the man in charge of NSA's Key Escrow:

>influence peddling, bribery). 

but this only suggests how much of a crutch they have become for these
agencies. They are terrified of losing this tool, for which they have
come to rely on disproportionately. They have come to associate their
job security with wiretapping -- a very dangerous proposition for freedom.

fascinating. has this ever been noted before? the IRS would have
benefited from this a few months ago. Or, on second thought, nevermind!
all the tax evaders on the list will object to the IRS getting any help!

reassuring to hear Dingaling is still alive and plugging away... I
wonder what her next Lead Balloon will be?

This is a very interesting stance, and IMHO not a bad tradeoff, if
`support' means `lack of active attack and criticism'. But the NSA
would never agree to this in a cyberspatial lifetime. We *still* don't
even have any substantial promise that Clipper is guaranteed to be
voluntary, let alone export restrictions relaxed. (Hypocritically, the
announcements have always touted Clipper as Voluntary, the last
redeeming feature cited by scoundrels like Dingaling and Sternlight,
without ever guaranteeing it, and potentially even hiding the plan of
*revoking* that aspect.) The plan, very likely, is quite to the
contrary: increase market penetration of Clipper to the point that
restricting other cryptography in subtle and insideous ways becomes
possible. And I'm still waiting for the announcement in blaring fanfare
that Clipper-based hardware can be freely exported, nothing else. I
think its close on the horizon. Once they get chips that work :)
