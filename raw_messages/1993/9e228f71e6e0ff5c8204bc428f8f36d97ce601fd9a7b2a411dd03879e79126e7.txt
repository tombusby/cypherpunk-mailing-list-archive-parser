In the UK, We don't have a first amendment :-(

The law has developed in such a way that anybody with funds 
available can silence criticism by issuing a writ.  

There is much more protection for public figures. for example 
Robert Maxwell, proprietor of Mirror Group Newspapers (& 
Pergammon Press amongst others) robbed his companies blind.  
Everybody knew that he was a crook, but nobody could say so 
because he had the financial clout to silence everybody who said 
so with libel writs.  The UK needs anonymous posting far more 
than the US does.
