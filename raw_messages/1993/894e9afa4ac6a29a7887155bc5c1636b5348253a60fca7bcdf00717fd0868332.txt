  I don't think e-mail over the Intenet will ever be used in court
since anyone capable of reading the RFC would be able to forge email.
So, anyone could claim that the email being used as evidence is a
forgery _and_ be able to prove it by doing it or demonstrating it.

  At least, I think this would be a way to get it thrown out.

  :-)  I'm not a lawyer, I don't even pretend to be one on MUD.
