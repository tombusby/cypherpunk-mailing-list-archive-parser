Here are some details about the crypto talk I mentioned recently.
You're all welcome to attend, though of course you need to be in the
Bay Area!

> Title: Implications of Modern Cryptology: Is the Crypto Genie
> Already Out of the Bottle?
> 
> Speaker:  Timothy C. May, Cryptologic Corp.
> 
> Abstract:
> The implications of modern cryptology are profound. Governments and
> national borders as we know them today will be affected by this
> technology in major ways.  Essentially unbreakable ciphers, secure
> communications, untraceable digital money, data havens, electronic
> voting, and black markets in information are just some of the likely
> developments.  Some of these already exist, others are on the horizon.
> Meanwhile, the Government has other plans, with its "Clipper"
> chip that keeps a "master key" and allows it to digitally wiretap at
> will.  Who will win?  How will these conflicting trends resolve
> themselves?  Is the crypto genie already out of the bottle?
> 
> These issues will be the topic of the talk, with plenty of time left for
> discussion.  The focus will be partly on technology -- just enough to
> provide a plausible foundation for belief -- and partly on the economic,
> legal, and political structures resulting from strong crypto.  No
> number theory will be used.

> Speaker Bio:
> Tim May worked for Intel for 12 years, retiring in 1986.  He discovered
> the alpha particle and cosmic ray effect on semiconductor memories, for
> which he received several awards including the IEEE's W.R.G. Baker Prize
> for the best original research paper.  Since leaving Intel, his main
> interests have been in cryptology, information theory, and investments.
> In 1992 he co-founded the "Cypherpunks" group and spends much of his time
> on the Internet. He's also trying to finish a novel about these topics.
