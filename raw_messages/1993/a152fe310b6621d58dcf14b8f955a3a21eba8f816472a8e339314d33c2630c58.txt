Well, almost true. 9600 baud !=9600 bps in modems. 9600 bps modems are actually
2400 token per seconds, with each token beeing 4 bit long. 2400 bps modems
are also 2400 bauds (token per seconds) like the 9600 bps modems, but with each
token beeing 1 bit.

No, it's the inverse 9600 bps are based on 2400 baud.

No, a 2400 bps modem is 2400 baud because each token is 1 bit long.
