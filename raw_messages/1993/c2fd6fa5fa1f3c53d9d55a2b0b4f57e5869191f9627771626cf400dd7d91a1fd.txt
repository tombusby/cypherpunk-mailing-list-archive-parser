That's OK with me.  This probably answers some questions for a few
others, too.

This is extremely interesting!  This "problem" was supposedly fixed some
time ago, but this is why I have alternate accounts elsewhere with more
common names.   In any event, I will pass this information along to the
proper persons.

This is yet another problem that was supposedly repaired - it should
read m..stirner@f28.n125.z1.fidonet.org, but a curious glitch in the BBS
reply software that handles conversions of mailings to conferences &
automatic routing of replies periodically enters all zeroes in the "f" &
"n" fields.  I will pass this along, also.

Yes, the zeros are wrong & were inserted by software out of my control.
I also have different addresses, true enough, but there is no f0.n0.z1
in fido; that address is a software error.  I suspect it'll be on this
message, too.

STILL....the problem I have is not addressed:  I cannot make a
multi-line header (as in the required "X-Anon-Password: password" line)
work through this UUCP gate, as far as I can tell.  I have been
attempting to route my mail to the penet remailer via other cypherpunks
remailers with the syntax:

::
Request-Remailing-To: anon@anon.penet.fi
From: anXXXXXX@anon.penet.fi
X-Anon-Password: password
X-Anon-To: alt.foolishness

But I am not sure if the cypherpunk remailer's address conflicts with my
From: field or not - I _think_ it does.  If so, I cannot use password
header lines unless anon.penet.fi can handle having blank lines between
the header fields:

To: anon@anon.penet.fi

From: anXXXXX@anon.penet.fi

X-Anon-Password: password

X-Anon-To: alt.foolishness


The above header will pass the UUCP gate here.  Without the blank lines,
the header gets grunged after the To: anon@anon.penet.fi line.
.   Thank you for your personal attention to this vexing problem.
