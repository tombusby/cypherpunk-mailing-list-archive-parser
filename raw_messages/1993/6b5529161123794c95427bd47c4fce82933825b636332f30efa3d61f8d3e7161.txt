I agree.  Besides, there are much more tasteful and aesthetic ways to get
the job done.  A degaussing coil is a good idea, or why not sell a 'simple'
add on (requiring making a hole in the hard-drive's casing), which, at the
appropriate moment would quickly inject a fast drying epoxy laced with
powdered aluminum, to which was applied a (well-grounded) high voltage/low
amperage electric charge from a capacitor built into the case?  There are
cheap epoxies on the market that could harden in 3-4 minutes at that volume
(rule w/ epoxies: spread out they take longer, in a glob as inside the
casing of a hardrive, the reaction would run much faster).  It will take
them a while to chip the media out, and the electric field should do the
rest....
