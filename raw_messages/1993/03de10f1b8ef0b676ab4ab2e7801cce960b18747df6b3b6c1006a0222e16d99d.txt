  Yes,  I started writing such a system about 3 weeks ago but quit when
school started. Basically, it was a mail server to be operated at gnu.
Remailer operators would "register" their remailer along with 
some stats (PGP or RIPEM capability? Public Key? Private Machine? Delay time?
Mix capability? Owner? Comment field.)

  The software would then "ping" each remailer every 6 hours and update
its database. If you wanted a list of current working remailers, you would
ask the mail server (I was even thinking of adding socket capability
for fast query)

  I might eventually take some time to finish it (it wasn't even 50%
done) but I've got too much work to do now.
