OK. Here's the de-glitched public key for Curve Software. It's properly
signed with my usual key (available via finger). It'll be on a key server
soon, hopefully with additional signatures, but I haven't gotten to it
yet. Sorry for wasting the bandwidth, but I wanted to get it redistributed
immediately...
 
Additional note:
I've received a few messages from anon users, ranging from very polite to 
major-league sleazy. So as a blanket response, let me make this very clear: 
I _will not_ mail Curve Encrypt to addresses outside the U.S. or to anon 
id's. I just don't have enough money to pay for the lawyers. Sorry.

The rest of you will be receiving it soon.
