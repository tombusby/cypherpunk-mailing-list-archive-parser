I'm not sure this is how it happened, but the person (maybe there's
more than one?) who did this is a cypherpunk, who will identify
himself if he wants.  He also wrote a paper on this.  The first
version of the paper had the private key at the top of the first page,
but it got removed because certain spooks got upset.
