I recall at some point that RSA put something out on the net
which allowed anyone to use the "patents or source code" for
non-commercial use.

Do I remember correctly? (I replied to the announcement)

If I am remembering correctly, would that give me a defacto
licensing of PGP for con-commercial use?

The reason I bring this up is that if the feds crack down,
they many decide to "help" RSA by legally fighting PGP users.

Which why it would be in our interest to legally (patent-wise,
despite how you feel about RSA, etc.) use PGP.
