I thought this might be of interest to a few of us SFRavers, given the
recent threads on privacy, virtual culture and the law, etc.  This is
taking place TOMORROW (Sunday), and I'd say there's an 80% chance I'll
be there -- I'd encourage as much SFR participation as possible.

        Jacking In:  A Monthly Series on Cyberspace Literacy presents:

        Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier

        Computer and telecommunications technologies hold great
        promise for individuals and society.  Increased access to
        information can enhance commerce, political participation,
        community development, and public health and education.

        But, between activities of questionable legality and the
        countermeasures taken by private parties and law enforcement
        officials, these technologies are raising fundamental questions
        about privacy, property, and our freedoms of speech and assembly.

        Join us for an evening of provocative presentations by:

        BRUCE STERLING, author, journalist, editor
        MIKE GODWIN, Electronic Frontier Foundation
        JOHN DRAPER, a.k.a. Cap'n Crunch, reformed cracker
        MITCH RATCLIFFE, cofounder This!Group
        BRUCE KOBALL, Chair, Third Conference on Computers, Freedom,
                        and Privacy
