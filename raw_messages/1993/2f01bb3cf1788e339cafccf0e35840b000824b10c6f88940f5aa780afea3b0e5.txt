I think anyone can join the ALA. Their Office for Intellectual Freedom
has run at least one computer censorship item in it's newsletter. The
director of the OIF, Dr. Judith Krug (U59587@UICVM.uic.edu) was at
Computers, Freedom, and Privacy '93. There is a good chance she'll be
at CFP '94 since it is in Chicago, her city and ALA headquarters.

Under some state laws, a computer BBS might be called a "library"
(depending on how it is run). See references at the end of this note.

I don't know of one, but Article 19 is an international anticensorship
organization (see refs).

The eighth note tries to define "library" to see how well term can
cover a Netnews service. The note lists the legal definition of
"library" for the few states that have such a definition. Indiana's
definition seems the best.<1991Sep12.185627.26936@eff.org>
