Libelous mail??  Hardly.

It is not appropriate for someone to post a 3600 line "junk" file to a
mailing list.  UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!  (Think about those sites that are
paying hard cash for e-mail transfers!)  It is reasonable for such actions
to be reported to the administrator of a system.

So far as getting off the cypherpunks list, there are a number of other things
to try if cypherpunks-request isn't working.  Send mail to root@toad.com. 
Send mail to the administrative contact listed in the WHOIS database for
toad.com (John Gilmore, in this case).  Talk to your local systems
administrator and ask his assistance.  What ghabrech did is something I
would expect from an immature freshman. (who knows... maybe he is one)

Retaliatory strikes aren't right either, of course.
