I don't see anything wrong or unethical about using software.
It is true that the Nazis used gas against the Jews in
WW II, so are you not going to use gas? I hope this doesn't
sound insensitive, but part of studying anonymity and
the pseudonymous experience is finding out what sort of
techniques can be used to discover someone's nym. I pointed
one out earlier - watching for double postings, one by nym,
the other by actual identity.

If studying writing patterns is a viable method for
discovering the true identity of a nym, then by all means
try it. If someone were to discover my identity, I would
use it as a learning experience. I'm going to be as
careful as possible, but I would not advocate ignoring
software if it exists, no matter what its historical
significance.
