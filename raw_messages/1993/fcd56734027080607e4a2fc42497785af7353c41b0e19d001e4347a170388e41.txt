Positive reputations _must_ be implemented at the user level, to my way of
thinking. Any system which centrally administers the reputations, as in
approved reading lists or movies approved by the Catholics (does this still
exist?) is not really what most of us want.

Newbies are often desirable and often turn into valued
contributors--sometimes from their very first posts. So I personally would
not want to filter them out.

The "Extropians" software, which many of us have mentioned here, allows
this kind of flexibility. 

I hope Cypherpunks can get it soon.
