> I have only recently seen a few of the IMP messages that have been
> forwarded to me. I have also responded to at least one person individually
> concerning the legal aspects of payment for the IMP. In this regard, I
> mentioned that about two years ago we began the development of a 
> 
> Model Electronic Payments Agreement and Commentary (for credit transfers)
> that is intended for electronic commerce purposes. Since the completion of
> the document, we understand that it has been adopted by various companies,
> including Airborne Express, Texaco, Baxter International, etc. It has also
> been reprinted by the Banker's EDI Council in its Guidebook. I recommend that
> developers of the IMP take a look at some of the conventions (and assumptions)
> that are included in the Agreement. The Model includes extensive commentary
> and a tuturial/introduction.
> 
> By the way, one of the challenges to the internet community will be to narrow
> the gap between localized/specialized payment approaches, and the "mainstream"
> corporate and governmental payment infrastructure that already is in place.
> Also, FYI, the American Bar Ass'n has a Financial EDI Committee that is now
> developing a debit counterpart for the above-mentioned credit Model.
> 
> Copies of the Model are available at cost as follows:
