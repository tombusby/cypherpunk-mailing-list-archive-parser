                      Julieboard DDS
Remember my constant whining about the lack of suitable hardware for
spread-spectrum radio? No more!

The August 1993 issue of 73 Amateur Radio Today
contains an article and schematic for: JULIEBOARD. Woo hoo!
 
Ahem. The Julieboard is a Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) circuit built
around the 28-pin DIP Harris HSP45102 DDS chip. A software controller
program is shown using GWBASIC. Here is a summary of features:
 
"0 to 16 MHz coverage (*Note: can be used to modulate UHF/Microwave*)
 0.007 Hz frequency resolution
 Virtually instantaneous switching time
 No drift/no calibration
 Excellent spectral quality
 Simple interface via PC printer port"
 
The following is music to my eyes (Wha?...Dhoh!):
"...there is no reason why an appropriately programmed single chip
 microcomputer (such as a Motorola '68705 or Intel '8051) couldn't
 replace the PC for those who object to having to drag around a
 large, bulky *Homer-mungous* PC just to drive a tiny little board.
 With a single chip microcomputer, an entire HF rig could be made
 to fit into a shirt-pocket-sized package!"

A circuit board can be obtained for $25 U.S. from:

Bruce Hodgkinson, VE3JIL
Box 232
Pakenham, Ontario, CANADA K0A 2X0
Phone: (613) 624-5247

A wired and tested 33-MHz chip system can be obtained from stock or 
within a week for $120+$5.00 S&H. A wired and tested 40-MHz chip 
system waits up to 8 weeks for availability of chips, and costs
$135+$5.00 S&H. Bruce told me that the 33-MHz chips he tested
worked fine at 40-MHz. It seems Harris is very conservative in 
their chip ratings.

Of course, nobody would use these DDS boards for direct-sequence, 
frequency-hopping, time-hopping, plus chaos-transmitted-reference
hybrid spread-spectrum transmitters to achieve signal hiding and
interference rejection. Nope. Last thing on MY mind.
 
Haa ha ha ha... eat flaming death statist scum! You are all doomed!
