There is plenty of DC area support fr such a group.  The only problem
that presents it self is where to hold a meeting where there will be
no hassles.

In addition a thought that many people are overlooking-  the wiretap chip
transmissions of encrypted data would make a perfect envelope for the 
transfer of more secure information encrypted with powerful encryption
schemes.  There would be no easy way to tell the diffence between
pre-encypted transmissions and wiretap chip encrypted conversation.
