   Why only "mass market" encryption?

   The company I work for is developing a collection of runtime libraries and  
   utilities which software developers can use to create and manage portable  
   object-oriented distributed applications.  Think of it as a  
   object-oriented DCE-like tool set with a run-time environment and system  
   administration utilites.

That's still mass market. There is already a mechanism for non-mass-market,
i.e. one-off, export of crypto; apply for an export permit. The idea of this
initiative is to allow products sold in quantities too great to allow
individual export licenses to be sold.

You sell your software as-is; the customer does any customization.

A developer's kit still qualifies as "as-is", mass market software. You're
covered.

   As I see it, the main distinction between "mass market" software and our  
   software is that our software is used to create other software, whereas  
   "mass market" software implies final product "end-user" software.

Not a useful distinction from the standpoint of commerce. "Mass-market"
means the seller does nothing special for individual customers; no
customization, etc. It means the volume is large enough that requiring
action on a per-sale basis (as is required for current crypto export
licensing) is essentially impossible.

   Why only "mass market" software?

Because the non-mass-market stuff already has the mechanism of applying for
individual export licenses; since it's not mass marketed, it's possible to
do special things on a per-customer basis.

   Does the DPSWG want the government to keep export controls in place for  
   the type of product our company is developing?

It doesn't.
