For all of you who didn't hear my talk at ECFP '93 in London on the 20th 
(quite a few since there were fewer than 75 there) here is my conclusion 
which addresses this subject.

****

"And what can we call this new form of social organization growing on the 
nets and in the modern fluid business environment?  When two or more 
people can meet together and communicate freely and privately without 
interference by outsiders, they can trade -- they can form a market.  If 
this trade on the nets is made free from even the possibility of 
external regulation, what we have is a free market and a free society."

Remember kids God fights on the side with the heaviest artillery.  Unless 
the government can come up with a way of blocking the above communication, 
it is SOOL.

So what if the car has a license plate if you can't tell what is in the 
car.  No matter what happens telecoms will be cheap.  Cheap means you can 
establish accounts and run a virtual network without disclosing the 
contents of the network messages or even that the network exists.  You can 
hide your virtual network inside a much larger pseudo network which 
contains nothing interesting.
