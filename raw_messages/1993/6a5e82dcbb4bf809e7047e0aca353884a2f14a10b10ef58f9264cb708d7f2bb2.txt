People may find this very interesting.....  the Pro Audio Spectrum 16
soundboard can play and record sound at the same time; as far as I know,
this is the only commercially available board on the market that will do
this.  (Commercially available is important, because it means that
people would be able to purchase said board cheaply, or perhaps
alreadydy have.)

So for roughly $200 US, and a little software, it should be possible to
put together something that would do encrypted voice communications over
the network.  Is there any interest in developing some sort of standard
protocol and software to do encrypted, compressed voice communications
over TCP/IP?  

I can think some obvious design constraints right away; it should be
device independent, which means it needs to be able to support multiple
sampling rates, and negotiate sampling rates, in case one side as a
limited range of sampling rates to choose from.  It should support both
multiple private and public key encryption algorithms, as well as
multiple choicese of compression technologies.  We'd probably want to
have a core set of algorithms that everyone would be expected to
support, for the sake of interoperability, and allow for people to
experment with more powerful encryption/compression techniquese.

And finally, for obvious reasons, at least one implementation should be
developed in a non-COCOM country.  :-)

Is this something that people would be interested in working on?

Hi folks,

There is a very early testing version of the GUS
(Gravis Ultrasound) driver available at

klingon.epas.utoronto.ca (the GUS archive site) in
directory pub/pc/ultrasound/submit.

This version contains a simple API which makes it possible to write
applications for GUS under Linux. Since there is no such applications
yet, this is just a hacker's release. 

*** This is just a pre pre pre alpha version. I will release an official
version after a couple of months. The official and supported version is
1.0 which you propably have already ***

Additionally this version contains some changes for SB and PAS users. It
is for example possible to record and play at the same time with PAS16 
(there is a new devicefile (/dev/dsp1 (minor 19)), whic is connected to
the SB DSP emulator of PAS.
