The plan of the Clinton administration for the ISDN-Net (?!)
will be a part of a workshop or a own theme and the fight for 
private cryptos (eg. PGP), include the trouble of P. Zimmerman. 
The 'Clipper/Skipjack'-Chip can/will be a theme, because storys
are "on their way", that german BSI (*my* translation:Federal 
Office for Security of Informationsystems) and the TELEKOM 
(Telephoncompany) have a plan like the NSA.
  
Where all this and more? At the CCC'93 (10. Chaos Communication 
Congress 1993).

I am one of the guys who organize this workshop and the congress.
We are reading 'comp.org.eff.news', 'comp.org.eff.talk' and other
information we can get.
But only to talk about the EFF *we thing* is not enough. It would 
be nice, if members of Your organization will be there and have 
the chance to explain what EFF is doing. And when You get new 
members *we hope so* it will be good for Your movement and the 
'global village'.
