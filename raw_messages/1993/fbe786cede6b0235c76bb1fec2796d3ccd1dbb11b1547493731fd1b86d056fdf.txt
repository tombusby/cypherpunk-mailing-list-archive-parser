They should put a mercury switch in it, so if you steal it and move
it around much, it wipes the keys. Also a "duress number" which works
okay, but displays a warning on the other party's phone display, in
case you're forced to call someone with a gun to your head.

What all buttons does the phone have? Normal dialing, secure voice,
self-destruct, anything else?

What baud rates does it use? How is the sound quality in secure mode?
It must use either a DSP (good sound, high baud) or a vocoder
(robot voice, low baud).

It could be public-key or DH exchange. Does the manual tell you to
read a hash value to the other party and verify it? If so, it's DH
and that's the protection against the man-in-the-middle. If not, it's
either public-key or DH-like but with authentication. In any case, the
key probably contains a small EPROM which selects and decrypts one of
the keys in the memory.

If classified secret and top secret info is involved, DES would not
be used. The NSA wants us to use DES, but they know better than to
use it for classified info. Probably something similar to Skipjack,
in a similar tamper-proof chip.

NSA issues the keys...I feel safer already!
Can you say, "key escrow"?
