Remember - the goal is to HIDE the fact, that there's a message!
If, having CDs and DAT tapes widely available, somebody sends
a home-brew digitized copy of it, won't it look somewhat
suspicious for KGB?  And if/when they throw you in a
nice small cell, you can explain your innocence
to the walls at infinitum (:-).

You're certainly right. But still see above.
