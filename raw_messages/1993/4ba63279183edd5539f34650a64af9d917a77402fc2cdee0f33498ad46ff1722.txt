I hate to disagree, considering that I prefer to agree with the philosophy
here, but it *can't* work that way, regardless of what we wish.

The problem is that bandwidth is a highly limited resource, just like
real estate is a limited resource. Eventually we will complete saturate
network bandwidth no matter what technology is used. This has been discussed
in various forums for many years. Once optical fiber optic bandwidth
peaks, you have to move to ultraviolet for greater channel capacity.
Then that is exhausted, and we will continue pushing...gamma ray bandwidth
fiber optic (or line of sight transmission) will eventually be a target,
despite its extreme difficulties even in theory.

At the same time we will be laying fiber and raising dishes to beat the
band. But no matter how well all that goes, we will *very* quickly reach
a saturation point of facilities as each new technology is introduced.

These days it's easy to be optimistic, because bandwidth is growing
geometrically. The problem is that there is no way in hell that that
trend can continue indefinitely. One or two decades hence we will saturate
theoretical limits.

Bandwidth is and will always remain a scarce and precious resource.

On the other hand, if you mean "slow channels by comparison with state of
the art channels," then yeah, *that* may as well be free at any given
point. Right this instant one could make an argument for 110 baud
channels being free.

I agree, but this seems to be a subject change.
