 Uu> It is rarely to one's advantage to "assist the police."  In fact in

Rather like "very tired" when used to describe the public appearance of
an MP as in, "...Sir Henry appeared very tired."  The term "very
tired" apparently is the pervasive newspaper euphemism for "very drunk."

Splendid finds, these, when one can keep them in alliance.  It's always
a joy to introduce them to firearms.

I won't waste a great deal of time in idle & uninformed speculation, but
I seem to remember that certain "public safety" types do not need a
warrant to intrude.  As a matter of fact, I know of instances where cops
accompanied such functionaries on trumped-up "inspections" to avoid the
trouble of getting warrants.
.   I should be pleased to hear qualified legal opinion on this.

Yes, but don't you feel _much safer_ disarmed?  No?  Well, be content
with a nice shotgun.

This shall no doubt turn up in sigs before week's end.
