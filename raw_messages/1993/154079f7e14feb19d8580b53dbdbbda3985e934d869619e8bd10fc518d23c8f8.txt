This is true, but I am not completely writing-off those without the ability
to get a hardware card: they will just have to put up with the, IMHO,
unbearable slowness of doing filesystem encryption through software.  I am
also examining the log-structured filesystem (Rosenblum and Osterhout) to
see if using that as the core to add the encryption to will make the system
useable without hardware.  Additionally, perhaps the fact that there is
some real use for a hardware DES card will get people to buy them and
increase their availability in general...

No.  Then again PGP is for encrypting _files_, not filesystems.  We are
talking several orders of magnitude difference in the amount of data you
are trying to force through them.  I guess part of the difference in
viewpoints we have is that I am spoiled on unix.  I have become used to the
high-bandwidth drives and networks that I use every day and would not be
able to stand the bottleneck created by doing the encryption in software.

Yes, a crypto drop-in that works like Stacker would be a good thing to have
available and I wish you the best of luck in your efforts.  On the general
DOS side though, I can run DOS under linux and have a DOS filesystem within
a linux system as well (linux plug :)

Either way, good luck.
