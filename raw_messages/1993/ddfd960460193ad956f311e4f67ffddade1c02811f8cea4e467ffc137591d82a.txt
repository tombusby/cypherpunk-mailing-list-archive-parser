It must seem a thankless task sometimes, I'm sure.  One thing I noticed
about penet.fi's processing of messages is that it at least scrapes off
the trailing addresses automatically tacked on at the end of every
outgoing message leaving all Fido BBSs.  A test message sent via the
babani remailer arrived anonymously, but with all three lines of the
address footer (see below) attached.  Hardly anonymous...

Yes, and don't think that we don't appreciate your efforts!
