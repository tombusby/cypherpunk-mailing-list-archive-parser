CypherPunks,

Is there anyone out there thinking that in several years all of us will
be looking back on this (The Detweiler fiasco) and remarking on it
as being something of a ground-breaking flame war that would have
repercussions throughout cyberspace and the future?  I was thinking this
today, while I was working away in my Lab.  "What a funny thought!", 
I thought.  Someday, in the near future, all of us will be able to say
that we were part of a major breakthrough in Cyberspacial history,
the first (I am afraid it will be the first of many) McCarthy-type
witch hunts (maybe in the future we'll be accused by "legitimate" 
government agencies of being the Medusas behind many Tenticles,
hunted, wrongly, like dogs).

I am chilled to the bone at the thought, personally.
