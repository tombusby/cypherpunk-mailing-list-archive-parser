This is not a constructive comment. What is your evidence that it is
false?  We should dissect the claims.

This kind of stuff seems to happen whether there are laws sanctioning
it or not, but does anyone know what law is being referenced?

On a general note, what would tend to validate/rebut the claim?  First
of all, the simple feasibility of such an operation must be called into
question.  There is a tremendous amount of data going over modems on
public telephone lines.  What is the chance that even a small fraction
could be monitored? (And an even more infinitesmal fraction archived.) 
The claim has appeared here before that it is "trivial" for a
government agency to scan for interesting keywords and sort the data
based on that.  But I think that even that would lead to loads of
irrelevant crap and require an army of intelligence agents to sort. 
Where is this army?

Also, the claims in the letter are referring to public telephone
networks.  Would this include all the networks comprising the Internet?
 If so, this multiplies the data volume immensely.  How could anyone
find anything useful in these massive streams?  Granted, *very*
sensitive information is probably contained within it, but how the heck
could it be found efficiently?

These claims that credit ratings are influenced by this secret
information are rather questionable.  What is the path from the
decision to mark a record with a black mark to the private companies
like TRW that record this?  Which clients or sources of TRW or whatever
are specifically those that monitor secret information?  What exactly
does he mean, "your credit rating is affected by your modem usage?"

If anyone could refute or demonstrate the actual meaning of HN06443 and
87AT4 codes on credit reports (I've never seen a report or these
codes), this would be a specific item to discredit, which would call
into question the whole of the claims.

Regarding the claim that one major monitoring hub is code named
"elizabeth" in Boulder Colorado.  There is a government standards
agency there, if I am not mistaken, I forget if it is NIST (?).  Also,
the National Center for Oceanic Research, which has very tremendous
computing power (e.g. Cray YMP) is there also.  In their tours they
show massive archival storage areas, which they say record major
amounts of global atmospheric data (e.g. temperatures, wind currents
etc.) collected from satellites.  These could conceivably be in part
"covers" but the idea is also rather unimaginable.  Can anybody report
on agencies in the areas cited?  There is the very specific claim of a
carrier in Columbus Ohio.

I propose that cypherpunks list be a central reporting place for what
might be called "public counter spies" who report on the illicit
activities of our governments.  Its already largely in that area.  If
we get enough expertise, nonradicals, and infiltrators here we may be
able to get better ideas of what the heck NSA really is doing, what
kind of monitoring is really going on, what kind of cryptographic
techniques can really be broken, etc.
