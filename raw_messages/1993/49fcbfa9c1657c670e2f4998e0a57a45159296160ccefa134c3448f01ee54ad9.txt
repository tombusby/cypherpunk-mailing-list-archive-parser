..I'll do my best to provide you with some literature on behavior
control.  I've got midterms this and next week, so a more complete
bibliography will have to wait for a few.  
	One book which I can say is a good intro to the topic is B. F. Skinner's
_Beyond Freedom and Dignity_.  It isn't as scientifically rigorous as most
psych texts I've seen, but it's a good start if you want to really pursue
the topic.  Hannah Arendt's _Totalitarianism_ looks a bit into the nature
of behavior control from a poli sci view.

	There are more, and I'll create a list ASAP.

	Later,

	Alex
