>Dear cert et al,

>It has come to my notice recently that your organisation has been

>I am referring to, and these are the ones I will mention here, the

>your methods, it doesnt do you any good at all to set about on a 
>crusade of self-serving actions against those sites or entities or
>groups of individuals you dont like or you see as furthering ideas
>and software that might one day make your life difficult. You will
>alienate a larger proportion of the net.community than you otherwise

>
>I would suggest in future you take the time to VERIFY, through whatever

>letters to people you see as gullible enough to carry out your desires
>really is less than professional.
>
>I fail to see where you get authority for a large proportion of your

>expect people to take you seriously if the above scenarios are repeated.
>
>The above is my own personal observations and not those of any other
