I agree, we talked about the matchbook a while ago, what happened to that?
We should do:
Stickers, "nice" shirts, T-shirts, matchbooks, a wallet-card, and the Tatoos

Well, we got working on it and kept getting less and less feedback. The

Other ideas I got we can discuss in email or if I get enough response, to
the list.
