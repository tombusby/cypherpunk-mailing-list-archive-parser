As N1KGX (William S. Yerazuni of Marloboro MA)
points out, echanging PGP fingerprints rather
than encrypting messages is completely permitted by
FCC regulations (97.113 in particular).

Also, amateurs particpating in tomorrow's net
are reminded of the callsign server

telnet callsign.cs.buffalo.edu 2000

in case their radios are near their net links...
you can verify fingerprint, name, call, address,
phone, or whatever coevally.
