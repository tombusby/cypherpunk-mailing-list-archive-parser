wow! a break in the clouds! a breath of fresh air! who is `we'? please
elaborate! This miscellaneous psychopunk is posting from MIT. Do you
think his burdensome flesh-cucoon is in Boston? or California?

AT LAST! HONESTY! (even if it is criminal or perverted)

Psychopunks, I'm most impressed with this new atmosphere of open
advocation of pseudoanonymity instead of all the black disinformation
snippets about `true anonymity' and all the other nonsense about it not
being widespread, no cypherpunks being personally involved, etc. for
the dreary 10 months or so I've been here. What trouble and heartache
for all of us you have caused me in pretending it isn't! Finally, they
Come Out of the Closet. Imagine -- having to hide in your own
neighborhood for so long. Really, it's all right. There, there.

When will the articles on Pseudospoofing come out in Wired and NYT? Oh,
let's see, there's Newsweek and all those other places too. Please,
tell me, I'm really in a tizzy. I'll have to call Mr. Kelly and Mr.
Markoff and tell them of your new openness. I'm sure they will be quite interested!

So, I would like to collect a list of all the Psychopunks who are
PSEUDOSPOOFERS and PROUD OF IT. Please, describe your lovely
techniques, all the pain and victimization you have gone through from
your tormenters (like me), and how you are going to Change the World so
that Pseudospoofers can Live without Harassment. `Live and Let Live'.
Sort of like Gay Pride. When are you going to stick it in your charter,
anyway? How pseudospoofing == privacy == anonymity == pseudoanonymity
== pseudonymity == holy liberation == bliss? What a delicious mystery.
Life a SF book by Card. What a Card.

Also, I'm still waiting for some kind of comment from those *fabulous*
leaders of yours. They're so coy with me. They've been flirting with me
since I've been on the list. It's really sexy and erotic, actually, the
way they strut around. You can look, but you can't touch! They're real
masters at the dance. Ooooooh... just FABULOUTHS.
