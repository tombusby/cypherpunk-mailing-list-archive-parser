PGPcompose 2.0 is available for ftp from 129.82.156.104 (the macintosh
in my dorm room... ;-) in /pub/pgpc it's all of 11K, so don't sweat
the bandwidth!

PGPcompose 2.0 has the following features:

  -can send mail through anon.penet.fi
  -keeps your anon.penet.fi password in a PGP'd file in your home directory
  -mails through 15 of the cypherpunks remailers (unlimited remailings,
   actually, but there's only 15 servers in it now (tell me of more!))
  -can encrypt and sign mail
  -pumps output directly to sendmail (once you find out where sendmail is...
   read the README for more info)
  -will keep you fron doing stupid things, like mailing though anon.penet.fi
   and then through the remailers, or signing a message and then sending it
   through the remailers or through anon.penet.fi, etc...

If you use it, send me some email.  I would like to expand it's abilities,
but I'm lazy... and tired.
