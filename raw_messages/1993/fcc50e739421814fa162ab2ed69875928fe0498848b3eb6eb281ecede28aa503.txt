The intelgence community get's what it want's.  If congress wont
allocate the funds, they'll import drugs to pay for it.  I dought
they can keep everything on file, but they certainly filter for
interesting data.

Fort Mead, MD.

A recent issue of Communications of the ACM is dedicated to the
issue of data filtering.  People have been working on this technology
for along time.  It's very importaint in the information age to
have all relivant information.

That's National Center for _Atmosphearic_ research (the nearest
ocean is 1300mi away), and it's so public there's probably no way
it could be used for such a purpose.  NIST and NOAA are also very
open.  However, we do have an FBI office here (I only know because
a friend of mine works for a criminal defence lawyer located in
the same building... briliant planing, no?).  There are numerous
warehouses in the east quarter any number of which could house a
database like this.
