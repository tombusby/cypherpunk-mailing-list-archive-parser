It's not that simple.  "Deadbeat" reported that he discovered this problem
when he sent mail via Penet to a list member asking a question.  When that
person replied, it exposed his anonymous ID.  There was no need to put
identifying information in the message itself.  The mere fact that a
particular message is being replied to gives away the true email address
of the sender (because that is the address to which the question was
directed).

This means that if you receive mail asking an innocent question, like,
"what is the address to subscribe to cypherpunks?", you need to be aware
of whether that question came from the Penet remailer or one like it.  If
so, you need to take extra care when you respond so that your anonymous
ID is not revealed.

I don't think so.  It seems to me that the current system makes it easy
to accidentally expose your anonymous ID.  If more people start operating
pseudonym-based remailers it will be that much more difficult to keep
track of whether you want to be anonymized or not.

I think technical solutions are needed along the lines suggested by Eric
Hughes and Deadbeat.

P.S. How about Deadbeat posting a public key?  He keeps signing his
messages but I can't check them.
