Hi All,
      I am currently upgrading Hal's Remailer to work
with SVR4(mail lock files as opposed to flock) and encryption
of the message body.

I am also looking at the implementation of  the following design goals:

 * Definition and implementation of a cryptographic MIX protocol compatible
  with the present day remailers(or with minor script changes).

Another area I am working at present on is a replacement for the
present anon.mail and hop.mail in perl. Design goals for that
companion script are:

 * Automatic generation of random hop routes for anonymous encrypted
  remailer return addressing blocks(function 2 from hop.mail)

 * Hop.mail mailing of files(Function 1) with auto route selection
 and generation.

Other desirable properties of a automatic remailer route generation 
script would be:
   
  * An encrypted remailer would always be selected as the beginpoint and
    endpoint in a remailer random route selection.

  * Non-Encrypted but anonymous remailers can only be used as the linkage
    remailer between 2 encrypted remailer nodes.

  * The next remailer number generated must be different than the previous
    remailer number generated.
    
  * route generation scripts should generate n number of nested
    remailer blocks where n is greater 4 and less than 30.

  * remailer numbers may be used multiple times in the same route
    generation subject to the conditions listed above.
     
  * a random seed needs to be generated to prime the generator.

  * A MUCH better function than  perl's rand is needed.

For the curious I am implementing this on a Stock SVR4 system with
MH 6.8(MIME). All scripts are being implemented in PERL (PL36).

I am interested in critique, additional desirable design goals etc.
