*Cryptography : Theory and Practice*

A Two Day Course at the University of Manchester

7th-8th July 1993

Electronic communications are being used more and more in all 
areas of business practice. The convenience and efficiency of 
using new technology brings with it new security risks to the 
confidentiality and integrity of important commercial data. Many 
of these threats can only be practically countered by the use of 
cryptography. This short course will give a basic grounding in 
the capabilities, and also the limitations, of modern 
cryptography. 

The course is intended for engineers and managers who require 
familiarity with modern cryptographic theory and practice. 
Lectures cover background theory, current algorithms, and their 
application in the provision of security services. Supporting 
practical sessions provide "hands-on" experience using software 
implementations of modern cryptographic algorithms. 

Syllabus Topics:
Cryptographic Basics
Cryptographic Theory
Symmetric Ciphers
Authentication
Public Key Cryptography
Digital Signatures
Cryptographic Protocols

The cost of the course is 225 pounds per person. This fee includes full 
course documentation and tea/coffee and lunch each day. Overnight
accommodation, at extra cost, can be arranged on request.
