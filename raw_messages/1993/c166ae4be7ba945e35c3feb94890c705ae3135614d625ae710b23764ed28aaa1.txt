Earlier, an anonymous person asked about pasting syntax, about how to
paste in a CC: header.

The answer is: it depends on which remailer you use.  For a Hal-style
cypherpunks remailer, you would do something like this:

----------8< cut here >8----------
::
Request-Remailing-To: someone@somwhere

##
CC: I am pasting this into the header as the mail leaves

Here is my message
----------8< cut here >8----------

But, if you use Chael's remailer (since I beleive he wrote his own
software!), you would do this:

----------8< cut here >8----------
::
Request-Remailing-To: someone@somewhere
CC: I am pasting this into the header as the mail leaves

Here is my message
----------8< cut here >8----------

Of course, you would only want to paste at the last hop since the
remailers would trim it out otherwise.

For example, this message should have an "X-CC:" header I pasted in.
