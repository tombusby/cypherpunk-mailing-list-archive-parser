Punksters,

Remind me someday to explain why I think there are only 10-20
million people in the world, max.  One "proof" is all the
"coincidences" we experience.  Anyway, here's another one.

Because I have written for MONDO 2000, WIRED and FUTURE SEX, a
friend sent me a newspaper clipping about some new culture and
technology oriented magazines.  She thought I should try to crack
them.

FAST COMPANY sounded interesting, so I called the column's writer
to find out where it is published.  We talked for a while and he
mentioned he had an article in today's paper about the PGP
indictments, Phil Zimmermann, etc.  Hey, there are no accidents.
If I'm lyin' I'm flyin'.

The article was neutral to sympathetic.  The factual content was
okay-doke except for one misguided reference to "cypherfreaks."
Oh well, what's in a name?

The article was on the first page of the business section of the
21 September San Francisco Chronicle.  "Cypherfreak" John Gilmore
got in some good quotes.
