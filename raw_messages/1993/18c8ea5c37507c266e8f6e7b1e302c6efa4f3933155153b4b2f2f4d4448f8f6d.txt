Please, send this paper direct to me.

Exuse me please, but I don`t see this man about two week! I also can`t
ask this man about all (I like fredom :( ). As security men saw: "if smaller
know then better sleep".

DES is`t group - f() only like to DES (I think, that computing dificult of
f() like des() one).

I`ll ask he about this.

He made same program (LanCrypto). That why, I hear only bad words from
he. :) You can read about this program in cypherpunks.
From other KGB-men, I hear, that prophesor Sidelnicov (the well known
cryptoanalisist from Russia) saw, that PGP has some weak places:
 - random number is`t "good" random number.
 - md5 has hole (but here man lapse into salence:( ).
 - PGP for DOS don`t have any anti-overloking tools.

BTW: LanCrypto play on last weakness: thay wrote litle resident DOS program.
This program crack PGP and than pgp sign (and check) only part of message.
LanCrypto public this resalt in buziness newspaper and show program on the big
computer-show. I think this is rough market, but it work well (as all, that
KGB made:))!!!

Now I know 3 powerful public-key Russian programs. All wrote by exKGB man:

- "LanCrypto" has vary fast algorithm, litle sign and several tools for anti-
  intruding.

- "Exelence" has number of anti-intruding tools and powerful cryptographic
  algorithms. This pakage also has inteligance hardware keys for prevent
  introding.

- "Blitc". The central bank try to use this program, but boys from LanCrypto
  find rough hole in hash function of this program and compromite this firm.

Now I contact with LanCrypto and Elias (autors of "Exelence"). I hope to
use thouse programs in my Computer Security Center. If you want I try to
write about this programs.
