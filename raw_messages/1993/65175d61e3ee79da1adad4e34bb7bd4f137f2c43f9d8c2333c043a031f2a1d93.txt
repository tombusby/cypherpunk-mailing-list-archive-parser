Well, it would have been nice to attend, but...

a) Because of time zone differences, it was already 0:41 on Sunday, Jan
   31 out here at the time you sent your message

b) There was no way I could get hold of my travel agent to get a flight
   ticket.. And the flight from Helsinki, Finland to SF is close to 11
   hours anyway...

Just a reminder that the net is a pretty global thing... Hope the party
was fun!
