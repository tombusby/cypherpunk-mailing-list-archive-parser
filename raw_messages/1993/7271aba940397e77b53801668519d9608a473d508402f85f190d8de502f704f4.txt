Traditionally, banknotes have NOT been 100% backed. Even if you chose
to have your digital cash itself fully backed, presumably few people
would place their money in checkable accounts (that is, counts upon
which drafts may be drawn) that were not at the very least invested
SOMEHOW. 100% reserve accounts might be available, with negative
interest to pay expenses, but I doubt many would use them for much
other than things like escrow accounts. Certainly whenever a bank
loaned you money or invested money it would do so with fractional
reserve instruments, as banks traditionally have.

If you own 1 ton, you just own one ton of gold. The medium of exchange
isn't a special commodity.  There isn't one dollar bill out there
somewhere for every dollar of value in property in the U.S. -- not
even one dollar bill for every hundred dollars in value! (I might be
slightly wrong on this exact figure, but the order of magnitude is
right.) Imagine I owned 1/20,000 of the dollar bills in the country
and kept them under my mattress. Would I own 1/20,000 of the wealth of
the U.S.? Would my "investment" grow in value as the U.S. economy
grew? Of course not, and of course not, but thats precisely what you
were implying.

Thats correct. On the other hand, most people don't want to trade
directly for services, because that would generate great
inefficiencies. Lets say you were a programmer -- not everyone you
would want to trade with would want or need your skills. How would you
buy bread, say? A medium of exchange is a wonderful way to securitize
barter -- thats basically what it is, you know.

Why not just have people use a normal currency? Seems like you have
some bizarre idea that the poor won't be able to afford the real
currency, which is silly.

Untrue. She's done work. Replace "gold" with "diamond", which she
sells to a jeweler.

You have this strange view that the medium of exchange is somehow
different from any other commodity. It isn't. Get that idea out of
your head.

It doesn't prevent anything at all. If gold is expensive in terms of
human labor, than all the players involved will use small amounts of
gold for their transactions. IF gold is cheap, they will use large
amounts. In neither case, however, will they notice any difference in
outcome at all. In other words, you are thinking as though the medium
of exchange in and of itself mattered, which it doesn't. 

Replace "gold" with "dollars" in your exposition and see how silly it
now sounds.

Actually, that part is very easy -- the excess clearings rule means
that the bank would go belly up within days or (in the modern world of
electronic banking) hours if it did that -- all the other banks it was
clearing with would notice massive outflow of the backing commodity
from the bank's accounts. Its very hard to cheat in this sort of
system. Thanks to computers, its easier than ever for people to check
on what banknotes (or their electronic equivalent) are good.

Or whatever. It really doesn't matter what the backing commodity is.

I think you've just discovered why it is that people use a medium of
exchange and not some strange barter system. Fungibility is an issue,
and the use of a standard medium of exchange means that you can
securitize barter.

Not at all. Puts and calls are bets -- they have behaviors very much
unlike trading in the underlying stocks. Of course, you can build
"synthetics", which behave like the underlying stock, but the options
themselves are rarely used that way because the market is efficient
and thus you can't make money that way.

> People trade these options instead of trading in the stocks.

More accurately, they use options as a means of increasing leverage.

I suggest learning more about how banking and economics works before
discussing this further -- there are some basic assumptions we are
both making that are very different.
