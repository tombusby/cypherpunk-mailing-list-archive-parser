It must be homogenous with the rave. For example, in the chillout room, you
put a mind machine, a vrave connection, an electronic LED race (it's way
cool to either create or modify handheld games into huge "techno" games),
and finally several PCs, modified as "rave machines(tm)" :) with some people
to explain how to get the keys, how to exchange them, what you can do with it,
and emphasize the cool side...

The majority or ravers in Montreal know about raves thru my radio show, Raving
Up North (emaill list) or my interactive phone line. I regularly talk about
the net, internet issues, etc... (been doing that for 2 years) so most people
know what the net is really about and they send lots of mail when the written
press around here screw up). Another point, i'll be doing a rave on may 8th
and the ravers have dubbed it the cyberpunk rave, even if it's called
Rave en couleur...

Definitely. The scene needs some dominant figures.

Vrave is used in the east coast too. Twould be really cool if some rave from
the west coast be connected may 8th... i'll probably have 2 lines here.

As most people who are heavily "connected". There is an article in the may/june
issue of wired about a guy called cursor cowboy who wants to connect everybody
he meets. Speaking of wired, i've read the article on crypto rebels aka
cypherpunks. What do you think? Please respond to me since i am not on
cypherpunks anymore because the traffic was too heavy and religious when i was
on.
