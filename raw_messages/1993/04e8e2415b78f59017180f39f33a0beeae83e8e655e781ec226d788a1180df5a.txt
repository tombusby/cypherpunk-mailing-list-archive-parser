I think the modulus operation destroys uniqueness.

I don't have a proof, but after working symbolically for a while, I
tried an example:

f = a x + b
g = c f^2 + c f + d

where I picked a = 11/2, b = 8, c = 25/2, d = 3.  I also pick P = 16
to keep it small.

So g = 903 + 4675/4 x + 3025/8 x^2 mod 16

and if I reduce each coefficient mod 16, I get

  g' = 7 + 3/4 x + 81/8 x^2 mod 16

Great so far.  (And I checked to see that g and g' are equal).  So
let's look at all possible messages and their encryption:

x       g'(x)	x       g'(x)
- -       -----	-       -----
1	15/8	9	15/8
2	1	10	3
3	35/8	11	67/8
4	12	12	2
5	63/8	13	127/8
6	8	14	2
7	99/8	15	67/8
8	5	16	3

There is a serious problem in the above: the messages 10 and 16
encrypt to the same ciphertext; 11 and 15 also; and 12 and 14.  The
ciphertext 3 decodes to 10 or 16, 67/8 decodes to 11 or 15, 2 decodes
to 12 or 14.  That's 6 out of 16 messages, a sizeable 37.5%.

This behavior may have uses in fair coin flipping or some sort of
oblivious transfer (I am not claiming this in the general case, just
in the example above!), but not as encryption.

Besides, the fact that even messages encrypt to integers and odd
messages encrypt to fractions probably isn't good.

So Matt, with the numbers you used to generate the challenge problem,
see if any messages encrypt to the same ciphertext, just as a check.
