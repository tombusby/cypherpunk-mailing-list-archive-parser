 This is all good encouraging stuff!  Of course you realize that half the

 Because they have no point in existing if they can be regulated, taxed,
 interferred with or "policed" (an abstract) by any govt or comm agency

 In MUDS (eg. Graphical muds!!) I think it would become easier than ever to

 Encyphered PunkNet too
