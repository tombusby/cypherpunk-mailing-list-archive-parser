Sounds good to me. If anybody out there is knowledgeable enough to write
an initial form letter I'd be thrilled to paraphrase and send one in, as
well as persuading as many of my friends and aquaintences as possible to
respond, as I did with the NIST application for license to use DSA etc...

BTW, I have never received any response or aknowledgement from NIST
regarding my application... Do you think that means that it was accepted? <G>

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
