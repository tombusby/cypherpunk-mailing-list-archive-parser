Yes, of course they can be implemented.

Fine, spend your time in a network of this character.
But I'm trying to inject some real world values into this issue.
Heres a clue, when your just playing games, this scenario is fine, when its
bigtime finance, industrial secrets and intellectual property with high
value, and the process of managing these things, you will find that 
reliabile security will be the number one requirement. In my opinion, 
Accountability will win over anonymity if it comes down to a choice.

I'm sure you are quite clever, there are lots of clever people around.

This is all fine and good in regard to the narrow focus you take on where
this technology is going, and what business needs from it.

Sigh..
IMNSHO is an acronym for *In my NOT so humble opinion*.
