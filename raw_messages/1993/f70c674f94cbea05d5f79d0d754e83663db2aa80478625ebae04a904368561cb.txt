won't include any "cc:" to extropians.

Dragon Tavern BBS   (213) 365-1132
pseudonym closet to shamelessly promote
his upcoming speeches at the 
H.L. Mencken Forum and the 
Libertarian Party of CA Region 62
Los Angeles Westside:

Assistant Director of 
the Agorist Institute,
"Techtics" columnist for the Tactics of the

Both speeches will be on 
the topic:
"Cyber Cash: Free Market Money 
Comes of Age" I will talk about untraceable 
digital cash, public-key cryptography,

threaten everyone's privacy: The Clipper/

subpoenas served to the Austin Code Works
