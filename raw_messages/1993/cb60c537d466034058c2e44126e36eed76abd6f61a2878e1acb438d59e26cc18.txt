As is the case with a good many other gov't. agencies, one can be sure
that all the crew are not 9-to-5ers showing up at one office.

It has been a good many years since I traveled in the lower strata of
these circles, but it was my information that the NSA, at least at that
time, had a manpower pool "hugely greater than the CIA's."  It is my
understanding that the NSA budget is highly classified - unavailable
even to most members of Congress.

I believe you'll find that the NSA also is involved in SATINT & ELINT
as well.  Never Say Anythings are busy little bees.

It is my belief from personal experience that the NSA requests &
receives operational assistance from those innocuous agencies in
positions to gather information of use to the NSA in the course of their
routine duties.

I've tried to read this famous tome a couple of times, but have been
unable to hack its turgid prose.  Someday. perhaps...

Excuse me, Tim?
