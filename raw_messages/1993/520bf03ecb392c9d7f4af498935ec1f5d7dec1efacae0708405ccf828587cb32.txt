Cypherpunks,

	It looks like a few people are trying out the bank...but there
is only so much you can try as a single user...so there needs to be a
way to contact other bank users and remain anonymous.  Being able to
contact other bank users will allow bank customers to conduct real
transactions, etc. 
	So, what I plan to do is create a remailing header using my
remailer's public key for everyone who uses the bank.  I will send the
appropriate remailing header to each user, which can then be attached
to correspondence between bank customers.  Then, each user can be
contacted via an anonymous remailer (mine) and the remailing header.
Following that I will send to each user the total list of remailing
headers, so each bank customer will be able to contact the other bank
customers.  Then, each user can contact the other users, and include
their own remailing header to receive responses.  Right now we're just
experimenting so I'd like the bank customers to be able to interact
with each other.
	How does this system sound?  I'd like to hear any comments
about the bank or ways the bank's customers may transact with each
other (preferably privately).
	Also, a few weeks ago, maybe even two months, someone posted
anonymously :-) that they were nearly complete with an implementation
of Chaum's digitcal cash (RSA encryption, decryption, blinded
signatures, etc.) scheme.  I'd like to hear from that person the
status of their project, and whether it is feasible to incorporate
their code into my bank server.  Remain anonymous if you prefer, and
include a remailing header so I can write you back.  Incorporating
Chaum's method, and cypherpunk-style remailers to conduct business
with the bank are two of my goals for this project.
