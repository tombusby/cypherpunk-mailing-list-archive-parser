Now Jim, you wouldn't be implying that our big warm fuzzy government would
EVER resort to using methods like that on it's own citizens, would
you? :-)  Not possible, unless you count Waco, Ruby Ridge, Ken Ballew,
John Lawmaster, no-knock search warrants, ad infinitum...

Seriously, I think you may be right, although physical security has always
seemed to me to be the weakest link in any crypto chain.  All I can say
is that scenarios such as you envision simply point out the wisdom of
always going armed.  Or did I read to much Heinlein when I was a kid? :-)
