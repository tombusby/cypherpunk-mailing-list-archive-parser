"It's a fact of life" is a fact central to the, ahem, cypherpunk cause.
Virtual personas are here.  The only question is how this will change the
way people deal with each other over the net.

That is one possibility: people start signing posts with IDs that
verifiably mean something over a wider range of net and RL spaces than just
a single small world like cypherpunks@com.toad.  Personas which consist
only of postings here might come to be taken less seriously, even if their
content appears useful and constructive.

I do not see what authoritarian action is needed, desirable, or practical. 
I would rather see a consensus emerge over how to behave in this new
environment.

I notice you didn't sign your post.  Can I conclude that you do not want it
to be taken seriously?
