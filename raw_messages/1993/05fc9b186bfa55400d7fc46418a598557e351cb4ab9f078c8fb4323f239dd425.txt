As I understand it the Libertarian Party qualifies membership to exclude
any endorsement of violent overthrow of government.  While some portion
of those affected by this policy may well have gone underground, I don't 
believe that cypherpunks as a committee of the whole are willing or ready 
to do so.

Then again as someone pointed out yesterday, cypherpunks aren't just 
libertarians and/or may be unwilling to accept this sentiment.  Some portion,
however large of those receiving this mailing list, may not agree with this
political leaning and may not consider it germaine to their participation.

Avoiding the appearance of endorsing the violent overthrow of government 
is prudent policy for any organization.
