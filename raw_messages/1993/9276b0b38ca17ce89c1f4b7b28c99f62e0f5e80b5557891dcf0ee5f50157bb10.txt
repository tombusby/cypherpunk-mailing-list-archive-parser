Don Corleone taught his son Michael to *keep his friends close, and his
enemys closer*.

meanwhile, don't forget for a second that the christian right
*will* toss your anarchic ass on the pyre where they *will* roast
pagan faggots like myself after they've squeezed you for your
support.

Religion has it's protection clearly enumerated in the constitution,
and a clear agenda to keep everyone elses freedom from being similary
enumerated.
Caveat emptor, and carry a loaded flamethrower, because the first
chance they get to cut you out of the deal you will need it.


Me, I plan to be long gone into the "Inner Zone (TM)".
