With all the new remailers, and more to come soon, I thought I'd post an
updated list.

Updated public keys and unix scripts should be available soon; hopefully I'll
update the dos batch files this weekend as well.

NOTE: my new remailer (elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu) is not on this list, partly
because I don't expect it to run for any great length of time.  It is more
of an experiment to support PGP and RIPEM at the same remailer.  If you
missed the public keys, mail to me and I'll send them.
