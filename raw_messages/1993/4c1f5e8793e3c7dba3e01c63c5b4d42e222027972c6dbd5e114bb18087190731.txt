Bollocks.  I'm sick of being labelled 'white het male'.  I am, but so  
what ?  Your response was the most power-oriented in this exchange,  
and your steroetypes are just as banal as me calling all lesbians fat  
& ugly.

What power structure ?  I don't see any power structure - in fact I'm  
just as powerless as anyone else is.

I'm sick and tired of having to be politically correct for fear of  
being called a bigot.  I'll be damned if I'll be turned into an  
emasculated new age man, as the ones I've come across repel me almost  
as much as child pornographers.

P.S. I'm no homophobe.  My best friend is HIV+ after having a  
bisexual history, and his girlfriends twin sister is a lesbian, who I  
like very much.
