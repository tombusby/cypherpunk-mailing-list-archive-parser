I have tried to make sure that it's not widely publicized, for reasons
stated below.

No.  I said that the cypherpunks site on soda is the most active one
on soda.  Quite a difference.

Look.  Bidzos is under fiduciary responsibility to exercise due
diligence in making sure unlicensed software is not distributed.  If
Bidzos were to get fired for not doing it, someone else would come in
and do exactly the same thing.

I've know Bidzos for a little over a year.  I've been distributing PGP
ever since the ftp site went up.  Not once have I ever told Bidzos I'm
doing this.  If I did, he'd have no choice but to stop it, having been
personally informed that infringement was occurring at a particular
place under a known agent.  I've asked Hugh Miller not to advertise
the site publicly, not because I don't want it used, but because I
don't want it to go away.  The site is registered with archie; if you
want it, you can find it.

Sometimes you have to be loud to get things done; sometimes you have
to be silent.  Domestic distribution of PGP right now is something
best done in silence.

>Are Tim and Eric under pressure from Bidzos to get
>PGP off their site?  

Tim doesn't have anything at all to do with the ftp site.  I do it on
a guest account on the machine, which for tactical reasons of software
distribution I'd like to keep.  I have never heard anyword from Bidzos
that he even knows about the soda site, let alone that I maintain it,
let alone any pressure to remove PGP from it.
