Major-league guffaws.

Craig Steingold indeed. Looks so much like Craig Shergold, of infamous
dying-boy-wants-Guiness-record fame, that I had to read it twice.

Paul, not Phil (his actual name).

Oh, no, not the Trilateral Commission again!

Right. Every commercial compiler has code that recognizes every version of
GCC source since 2.2.3 and inserts into the generated object code some new
stuff that makes the freshly compiled GCC recognize every version of PGP
released since 1992 and inserts into *its* object code magic breakage that
creates an NSA trapdoor.

I hereby nominate this message for the Cypherpunk's Paul Bunyan award, 1993,
in the category of "Biggest Whopper".

(Oh, yeah. While I'm at it - Detweiller's Medusa theories, in conjunction
with his pseudospoofed distribution techniques, are hereby nominated for the
Goebel's Memorial award for "Best Big Lie" of '93.)
