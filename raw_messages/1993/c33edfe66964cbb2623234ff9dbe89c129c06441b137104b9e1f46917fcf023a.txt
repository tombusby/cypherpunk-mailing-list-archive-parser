According to nobody@alumni.cco.caltech.edu:

        PGP 2.2 runs without a hitch on at least one 10 MHz+ XT
  box in which the 8088 was replaced with an NEC V-20 and an 8087
  co-processor added when new... about six years ago.

        Probably far more XT boxes running, worldwide, than some
  are capable of imagining.

        Key generation on the XT is as exciting... and as fast...
  as a baseball game, but who generates new keys daily?

        Encryption speed is more than adequate.

         Not so high a brag-ability index as its companion box,
  a 486/66 EISA... but to use that machine for encryption seems
  an utter waste of processor power.

         `Course, if one can only afford a 486, I suppose one
  must make do as best one can...
