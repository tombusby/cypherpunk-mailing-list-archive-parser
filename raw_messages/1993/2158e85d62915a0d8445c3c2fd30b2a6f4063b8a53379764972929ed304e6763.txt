 I find myself straddling the line most of the time, but I have to
 come down solidly on the side of privacy-advocate, if push came to
 shove. However, push isn't shoving, so we (cypher-punk-advocates)
 should all be able to heterogeneously work our goals -- soild, secure
 and unmolested crypto for the masses. Let's be realistic -- and
 effective.

Anyone who thinks that this battle can be won purely on the grounds of
technology is dead wrong. Political leverage is a factor which we
must, absolutely be striving for.
 
We're getting there, slowly (very slowly) through education, but
digital realization is something that is not going to happen
overnight. The impact has yet to hit home in the public sector.

Oh, come now, Perry. Let's be practical. I (on just one side of
this multi-faceted topic), on the other hand, maintain more
conventional idealisms; much more geared towards maintaining
privacy (at all costs) and fighting the big brother machinations
of a government out of control. In my own hairy opinion, anarchy
is a losing strategy, but that is merely a matter of semantics,
not something we should hash out on this list.
 
I believe in the growth of the world-wide matrix; the growth of the
internet -- access for the masses. In fact, that's just what I do to
earn my pay. Filter this, Filter that, BGP this, EGP that, OSPF (oh,
no!). I believe in strong cryptography. I believe in your power (and
mine) to actually endorse and shape the world of digital
communications.
 
Let's just agree that we hold the same views on the matter of
cryptography: it's a powerful tool. In the hands of the masses, it
allows privacy unhindered. Compromised or crippled by the oppressive
forces of a government, it is a weapon against privacy.

A wise summation. I would like to think that others are as aware of
the political battlefields that must be crossed. I despise the
political machine, but I understand the importance in influencing it
in order to achieve the ideal "space."
 
Government has no damned business in networking.  We do.
