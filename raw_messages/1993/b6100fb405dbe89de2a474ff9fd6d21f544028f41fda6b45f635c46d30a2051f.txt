You can stop spreading the word now.  PGP is back on soda.  Remember,
it is my analysis that soda is still able to distribute PGP because we
keep a low profile.  Please keep it that way.  You can find pgp with
archie, so I don't feel the need to advertise.

Lots of stuff happened today after I posted my initial announcement
that PGP had gone offline.  Because of the intervention of Eric
Hollander with the folks who are in charge of the machine,
reasonableness has prevailed.  What happened in a nutshell was the
following.  Person A, a fascist asshole by all accounts, simply turned
off the PGP directory without telling me.  I started getting questions
by email from folks trying to get PGP.  Person A's argument was that
PGP was illegal, therefore soda should not distribute it.  Eric
Hollander, after some initial rounds, played trump and observed that
the machine had been recompiled without the user limit that had been
part of the OS license agreement, and recommended that soda be shut
down immediately because the kernel that soda was running was contrary
to the license agreement.  Very quickly the president of the
organization which runs soda intervened and everything was OK.

What is still troubling to me is the nastygram that came down from
CERT.  We don't know how they were informed, nor what their policy is
on this.  I'll have another message on that angle later.

Eric
