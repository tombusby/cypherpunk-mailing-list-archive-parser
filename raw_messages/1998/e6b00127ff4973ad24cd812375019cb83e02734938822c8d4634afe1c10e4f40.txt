the article states that it is difficult for consumers to
find companies when trademarks are not equivalent to 
web site addresses.

solution: a "trademark directory" web page-- say,
www.trademark.com. it gives the
official web site of all companies in the world. yahoo
is close to this but not quite. an opportunity for a 
budding entrepreneur. it would clearly be a very
high-traffic site, ripe with advertising possibilities.

added benefit:
it might cut down on the animosity going on over 
web site addresses, "poaching", and lawsuits over ownership.
