Anyone else find it interesting that the release for this outside of NAI press release was at CNN/fn and not CNN's tech section?  The stock shot up 6 and 3/8 on the 
news.  Pretty nice Christmas bonus to say the least.

Couple other more timely and detailed notes on the event:

Also a local TV station (Austin) on the 5pm news last night had some official
working on this fiasco quoted as saying that this was the first large case of
"cyberterrorism" that he had encountered.  I hope the national media doesn't 
start goose stepping to that account things; otherwise, expect this and related 
events to be cited by CIAO and other gubment offices in their initiatives next year 
to round up network incident response teams nationally and globally.
