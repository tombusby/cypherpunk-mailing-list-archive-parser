In May, Preflight Pro 1.0 received the 1998 Apple Design Award for 
Best Look and Feel. 
Just wait 'til they try 2.0.

The best just got better.

Extensis Preflight Pro is a comprehensive preflight solution designed 
to save prepress professionals significant time, money and materials.  
Preflight Pro inspects your documents and corrects problems to ensure 
they are error-free prior to printing.  

With an interface that mimics the traditional prepress workflow, 
Preflight Pro 2.0 provides you with a familiar environment to efficiently 
review files prior to printing. Further, Preflight Pro now supports 
documents in all the major graphics applications including Adobe 
PageMaker, Illustrator, Photoshop, QuarkXPress, Macromedia FreeHand, 
and Multi-Ad Creator2.


New in Preflight 2.0 is the capability to automate the preflight 
process. Based on your custom settings for pass/fail, Preflight Pro 
uses 'watch folders' to determine which files are complete and ready 
for printing. Users can set the automation window for tasks, such as 
collecting a job or running an AppleScript.

For greater utility, Preflight Pro now includes 5 free copies of 
Collect Pro 2.0. Give  Collect Pro to any creative professional you 
work with to help them perfectly collect a job for hand-off to the 
prepress house.  Collect Pro eliminates the problems of missing file 
information that can delay a job. 


Extensis Preflight Pro 2.0 will dramatically streamline your preflight 
workflow, saving you time, materials, headaches and money. 

In the world of preflighting, the best just got better.
