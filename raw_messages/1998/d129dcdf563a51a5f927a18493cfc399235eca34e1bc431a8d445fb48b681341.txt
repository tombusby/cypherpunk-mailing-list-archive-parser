This is the FIRST TIME EVER that on a worldwide basis a US$1,000,000
beautiful Edwardian property in Oxford, England has been offered on the
Internet as the prize in a Contest, which is valid where not prohibited by law, and may herald the start of a new trend to 'sell' property through the Internet.

It is as easy as that on the Internet.

'Belmor House' has been valued unfurnished at US$1,000,000 by internationally

Promotion.  A firm of Chartered Accountants is monitoring the Contest.  The
