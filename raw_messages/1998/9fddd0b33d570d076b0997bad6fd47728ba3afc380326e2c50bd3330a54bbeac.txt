The point is that it would *not* effect single instances or markets, it
would effect the very fabric of trust that is inherent in a society that
rewards creativity. If there were no copyrights and by extension no
protection for the creator or implimentor of an idea we would have a
situation where the groups with the resources would be the ones able to best
actualize and therefore reap the benefits of ideas. In such an environment
why would some individual choose to go head to head in a battle they
couldn't win due to resources and a lack of a standard infrastructure?
They wouldn't, they'd go back home and grow food and mind their own
business. They wouldn't exchange ideas because it could be taken as a given
that mail and other forms of non-direct communications would be insecure.

not receive it and that some intermediary would in fact take possession of
that material and take advantage of it. So we can assume that people would
not work on colaborations bigger than their immediate neighborhood. Now it
is also clear that within that neighborhood some will have more resources to
actualize ideas in respect to many of those who actualy create the ideas.
In such an environment why would the individual increase this parties
resource share to their own detriment? They wouldn't.

The protection of ideas and the reaping of the actualization of the creation
going to the creator is the issue, copyright is simply one of many
mechanisms that impliment this fundamental belief of who should benefit. If
we do away with this we are also doing away with a much deeper and
fundamental aspect of modern society, trust that our toil will benefit us in
the end.
