I HOPE to write one of the MOST DEVASTATING, and deserving, ARTICLES
ABOUT 
CRYPTOGRAPHERS EVER WRITTEN. 

By introducing to the public:

		MACHINE COMIBINATORICS

I stand on the shoulders on several GIANTS.  

I searched the web for Cardano.

http://www.lib.virginia.edu/science/parshall/cardano.html

And one SUPERB mathematician

  Ore, Oystein. Cardano: The Gambling Scholar. Princeton: University
Press, 1956. 

I may need your help with Zola.  YOU understand math, Zola MAY not.

Best 
bill

I'm going to write an article for The Laissez Faire City Times 
http://zolatimes.com/ 
 
	Black and White Test of Cryptographic Algorithms 
 
I have what I want to write CLEARLY in mind.   
 
THINKING before DOING works better than the CONVERSE.  But this takes 
time, of course. 
 
How much $s would such an article be worth? 
 
We have to keep in mind WHY we are doing all of this.   
Like what Baranyi is doing at http://www.qainfo.se/~lb/crypto_ag.htm 
 
I will write when I take breaks from debugging and documenting digital
FX hardware. 
$s, again.  The digital FX was HOPEFULLY very well thought-out and will
work reliably 
in the field. 
 
Here are SOME of my references.

                                    HOLLYWOOD (October, 1997) -- London
Records is 
                                    pleased to announce the release of
Howard Shore's 
                                    original motion picture score to The
Game, starring 
                                    Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.  
 
                           The film is a thriller directed by David
Fincher (Se7en). "The Game" is 
                           what begins when a high-powered businessman
named Nicholas Van 
                           Orton (Douglas) receives the birthday gift of
a lifetime from his 
                           brother he alienated years ago (Penn). What
Nicholas gets is entry 
                           into a mysterious new form of entertainment
provided by C.R.S. 
                           (Consumer Recreational Services) simply
called "The Game." It 
                           proves to be an all-consuming contest with
only one rule: there are 
                           no rules. By the time Van Orton realizes he
is in, it is too late to get 
                           out. Laced with intrigue, action and danger
beyond belief, The Game 
                           ultimately draws to a cataclysmic close,
every step bringing Van 
                           Orton nearer to an explosive confrontation
with what threatens him 
                           most.  
 
                           Howard Shore has written a tense and gripping
score. The 
                           soundtrack features "White Rabbit" performed
by the legendary 
                           Jefferson Airplane.

          The contemplation of things as they are,       
                without error or confusion,       
            without substitution or imposture,       
   is in itself a nobler thing than a whole harvest of invention.
