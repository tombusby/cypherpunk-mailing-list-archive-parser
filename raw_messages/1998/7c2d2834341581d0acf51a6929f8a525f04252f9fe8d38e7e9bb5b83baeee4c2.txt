>      WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., attempting to fend off contempt
>      of court charges, plans to make a detailed defense in court that its
>      Internet Explorer software is interwoven with its popular Windows 95
>      program and the two can't be separated without debilitating the
>      Windows program.
>      
>      Attorneys for Microsoft and the Justice Department are scheduled to
>      face off in federal court again Tuesday in the latest chapter of the
>      bitter antitrust lawsuit. The Justice Department has asked U.S.
>      District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to find Microsoft in contempt
>      of his December 11 order that it separate its Internet browser
>      software from Windows.
