Nonsense, in this country the people chose to give the federal government
specific duties in regards violence and when it could be used and how. It's
nowhere near as one-sided as you would have anyone believe.

I find NOTHING in free-market theory that says violence is bad let alone
that it won't be prevelant. I hear a lot of folks claim this is the natural
result but then again, that's what Trotsky and his ilk did back at the
beginning of this century.

Simply claiming something about a potential system is not the same as
demonstrating that it actualy works that way.

They are if they impact what people do with their income. Simply saying that
we're going to ignore the political and economic impact of a sector of human
indeavour simply because it doesn't if within a nice little chart is a
disservice.

Which takes money and time which has to come and go somewhere.

Please demonstrate what about anarchy will coerce (there is no other term)
individuals to do what is best for their neighbor. In the process you will
need to demonstrate as well why other systems prevent or prohibit such
expression currently.

If taken as individual instances, trying to argue from the specific to the
general in this case raises a whole can of worms that none of you are
answering, though I must admit some very nifty side-steps.

Nobody claimed that Bill, straw-man.

Explain how it works, it's that simple (and repeated for about the umpteenth
time).

I find another aspect of anarchism pretty interesting, that is the level of
cooperation and homogeneity it would require for people to work together.
They have to give up various expressions of their religions and personal
beliefs in order to participate, othewise they let the assholes house burn
or whatever.

Sounds suspicously like socialism where each person is expected to
participate and produce according to the good of the many.
