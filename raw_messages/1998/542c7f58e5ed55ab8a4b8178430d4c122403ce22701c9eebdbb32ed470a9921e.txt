Are you imagining "limited traceability" being discovered to be not what
it claims to be?

It was humorous that several of Chaum's equations were printed upside 
down and/or mirror-imaged, yet got through the 4-year review process 
just fine. He must have chuckled at that.

And that several "embodiments of the present invention" just flat out
said "if you trust this digital transaction you are one dumb MF who 
deserves to be monitored,"  thereby assuring the user of his invention
that a target is just as dumb.

It's impressive that Chaum intends to fleece the law-abiding and the 
outlaws by getting them chasing their tails thinking they're secretly 
tracing/escaping the opposition while he laughs all the way to the . . .

Y2K is the tip of this techno-shamanry-duplicity, wild humor with a
straight-bankers-face, umm, like guess who -- our best Chaumian style
comedian.
