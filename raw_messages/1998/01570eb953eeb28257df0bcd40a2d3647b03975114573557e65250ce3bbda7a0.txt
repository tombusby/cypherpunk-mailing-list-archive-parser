The Defense Department plans to create a new military organization 
to spearhead DOD's effort to protect the nation's critical computer 
systems against information warfare attacks, marking the first time 
DOD has taken responsibility for protecting infrastructure within
the United States. ...

The Pentagon also is considering the formation of a reserve cadre 
of "cyberdefense warriors," who would have hands-on responsibility 
for protecting the nation's sensitive information networks and 
systems from information warfare attacks. According to an industry 
source familiar with the project, about 300 Ph.D.-carrying 
reservists would work from home computers that would be tied into 
high-speed communications links. DOD has budgeted $10 million to 
jump-start the effort, the source said. ...
