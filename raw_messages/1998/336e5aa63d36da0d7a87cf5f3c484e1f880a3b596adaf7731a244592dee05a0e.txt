I believe _all_ forms of money, whether hard, fiat, whatever, come from the
expectation that the money will be of the same value, more or less, in the
future.

Call it the "greater fool theory of money." All one cares about is that a
greater fool will take the money.

Whether the money is gold or funny bank notes or e-money, the Bayesian
expectation of future value is what matters. Discounted appropriately for
interest paid, etc. (Thus, one might be willing to be paid in gold coins or
in E-Bay LEAPs, provided the terms were laid-out and could be calculated.)

As always, reputation is critical.  Repution = Belief = Expectation.
