What did I say about not paying for people's work?  I'm perfectly
happy to pay for code, and I prefer to buy open source code; it tends
to be higher quality.  I don't want to have to accept your opinion on
how I should release code along with the code.

	You're being intentionally obtuse.  I excluded the L/GPL from
my comments, and you respond to them as if I was discussing the
L/GPL.	Further, I said above that using code thats been reveiwed is
better from a security perspective.
