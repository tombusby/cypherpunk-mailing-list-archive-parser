It could be worse. They could have transferred me to the "Home Shoppers 
Bargain Psychiatry Warehouse".
That's the worst of the worst. The Shop'ers have the poorest government 
on WebWorld. When the citizens of the former world governments got to 
choose their citizenship at the end of the Channel Revolution every
deadbeat compulsive spender on the face of the Earth signed up with the 
Home Shopper Channel Government.

The Shop'ers ran ads showing Leona purchasing magnificent jewelry and 
other high-priced items from the Home Shopping Channel and the masses 
rushed to join the bandwagon. Some of the slightly more discriminating
people became citizens of the Consumer Channel, but they were few and 
far between.

The Sex Channel offered some rather interesting incentives for new 
citizens. They did quite well in the final ratings (what had formerly 
been called 'election results'), despite fierce competition from the 
S&M Channel, the Group Sex Channel, the Lesbian Channel, the 'Buck 
Futters' Channel, and a host of minor players vying for the same basic 
audience.

No doubt General Noriega was given a day-pass to drop one-pound
packages of Peruvian flake out of a helicopter, as loudspeakers
blared, "You deserve a brick today..."
