Thank you for becoming a Switchboard member! To login at any time,
use the following password with your Email address:
 
     Email: cypherpunks@toad.com
  Password: OffFour
 
You can change your password to something familiar the next time
you login.
 
  [Please NOTE:  This is not a password for your Internet Service 
   Provider account or a valid login for Switchboard's Free E-mail 
   service.]
 
To log in to Switchboard, point your browser to our home page at 
http://www.switchboard.com and click the My Corner icon. From the My
Corner page, you can select either the Modify My Listing or the 
Create/Modify My Homepage Option.  You'll then be prompted to enter 
your complete email address as it appears above and your Switchboard 
password to login.
 
If you choose to **Modify your Listing** you'll have the opportunity 
to include the following:
  
Business information
Cell phone number
FAX number
Pager number
Home page URL
Groups you are affiliated with
Schools you attended
And more!
 
You can also take advantage of Switchboard's unique Knock-Knock
feature to secure your email address or add an alternate listing to 
identify a nickname, maiden name or additional family member. If 
necessary, logging in allows you also to change your password or 
unlist yourself.
 
If you choose to **Create / Modify your Homepage** you can take 
advantage of My Studio, Switchboard's easy-to-use, interactive 
homepage builder.  Switchboard homepages are FREE and My Studio makes 
it so simple that even a beginner internet user can create a stylish 
homepage in no time at all.  
 
Remember - only after you REPLY or LOG IN once will your listing (and 
homepage) appear in Switchboard as you requested. These actions verify 
to us that the e-mail address you supplied was valid.
 
If you have questions, point your browser to Switchboard's on-line 
help files at http://www.switchboard.com/suptctr.htm or write to 
webmaster@switchboard.com. (Do not reply to this letter with 
questions, because the Registrar is an automated mailbox and your 
letter may not be read by a person.) 
 
If you did not request Switchboard membership, either forward 
this letter to webmaster@switchboard.com with comments, or reply 
to this letter with the "Subject:" field changed to "cancel".
 
Thank you again for using Switchboard.
