>      WASHINGTON (AP) -- The arrests in Nevada of two men accused of
>      possessing anthrax or its precursor highlight the findings of a
>      recent federal report warning that public buses and trains are
>      vulnerable to terrorist attack.
>      
>      Indeed, an FBI affidavit said that one of the Nevada men had talked
>      about plans to spread bubonic plague toxins in the New York City
>      subway system.
>      
>      "For those determined to kill in quantity and willing to kill
>      indiscriminately, public transportation offers an ideal target," the
>      report said.
>      
>      The report was commissioned by the U.S. Department of Transportation
>      and written last year by terrorism expert Brian Jenkins.
