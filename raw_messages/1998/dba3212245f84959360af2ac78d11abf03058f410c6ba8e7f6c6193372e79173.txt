You missed my point.  What I'm trying to point out is that no government
(or any other body, for that matter) can prevent someone from doing
something.  All the state can do (and does, if you look closely) is
offer to punish anyone who disobeys it.  It doesn't matter whether that
state is protecting individual rights or not --it can only punish, not
prevent.

> Of course, this implies there are no collective rights either.

Correct.  There are none.  There are no collectives, only groups
comprised of individuals.  Therefore it would be meaningless to speak of
"collective" rights.

I'm explaining why it is impossible for the state to protect individual
rights. I offer two mechanisms by which the state *could* _protect_
individual rights, and then point out why they are impossible.  It is
something of a strawman argument, but if you disagree, I'm willing to
tear down any mechanism you might propose. :)

Is it really?  Then could you please explain to me exactly why I would
have to pay taxes (or otherwise make submission) to a state which did
*not* have the power to kill me?  If it lacks this power --and I mean
this in a physical sense, not a legal one-- then what is to stop me or
anyone else from telling it to fuck off?  Such a state cannot govern
those who do not wish to be governed, and so would not be a government.

Occasionally, yes.  The state does not yet have absolute power, or does
not yet choose to wield it fully in all situations.  But we've already
got an impressive list in the USA alone.  We've had Ruby Ridge, we've
had Waco, the countless raids on the homes of innocent people in the
name of the drug war (and the countless raids on the homes of innocent
drug-addicts, for that matter).

Correct, which is the main reason that we cannot trust a state in any
shape or form, regardless of how good the people running it may seem.

Actually, I wasn't thinking of Hayek at all.  ;) 

I was just pointing out that a "benign" state, even if it were possible
to create one (which, as you pointed out in your last paragraph, is
impossible), would not stay benign very long.  Economics is not
discussed in this portion of the argument.

Forgive me, I was trying to shorten the sentence a bit, and assumed that
"evil men" would be understood to refer to those men (and women) who
wish to rule other people, for whatever reason.  Your personal
definition of evil may vary.  

Can we agree that it is wrong to rule others?  This is the fundamental
distinction which sets us apart from the statists.

The war of northern aggression is more of a reverse revolution, from
this standpoint.  The south peacefully left the union, and the north
reconquered it. It's roughly analogous to what would have happened had
the british won the american revolution.

As for the civil rights movement; it just goes to show that not
*everything* that happened after 1776 was a bad thing.

Not by the definition of a state given above.  The minimalist state must
wield sufficient power to rule those who would disobey its edicts,
otherwise it's not a state --just a bunch of losers who dress pompously
and issue meaningless proclaimations.  Anarchy is the *absence* of the
state.

You are proposing a means of setting up a benign government.  For it to
be a government, it must wield sufficient power to rule.  For it to be
benign, it must be run by "good" men (i.e. those who will not use the
state to increase their personal power).  But as you pointed out, it is
foolish to trust that the state will be run by such individuals,
regardless of who they are.  Thus it would seem that it is impossible to
create a benign state.  Thus we should avoid having one.

I used the word because the person I responded to used it.  Exactly what
is considered "immoral" does of course vary from person to person. 
Perhaps a better word would be "wrong", "antisocial", "socially
unacceptable", or perhaps "not to be tolerated".

> A person is, they don't belong to anyone.

No, a person belongs to him or herself.  *Someone* is directing my
actions, and guess what: it's me.  I choose what I will and will not
do.  I choose what I say.  I choose what I think.  I belong to me.

Correct.  It is wrong to initiate force against another person or their
property.  It is of course no problem if the person owning the property
gives you permission to harm it.  Then it's not initiation of force.

I agree.  This more detailed explaination of how much force should be
applied in response to an attack.  It should be small enough to ensure
that you don't accidentially end up looking like you're in the wrong
afterwards, and large enough to ensure that there *is* an afterwards. ;)

Correct.  No state can be benign if it is run by corrupt individuals. 
This is another example which supports the idea that the state is a bad
idea.

No, I'm describing what are obviously *not* rights.  If someone has a
"right" to an education, then that means that he has a right to get it
whether or not he can pay for it.  That is, if he can't pay for it, he
has the right to take money which belongs to other people (i.e. steal
the property of others).  (either that or he has the right to a "free"
education, which translates to him having a right to make someone teach
him without compensation, which is also theft).

The same argument applies to welfare.  If you do not agree, then what
you said about it being wrong to harm another person or that person's
property without their consent is sheer hypocrisy.

So, you're saying that you're a statist? :/

In a strictly legal sense, you are correct.  In reality, however, things
are slightly different, since there is a large supply of men with guns
who are apparently willing to execute these legally unjustified orders
--and me, if I get in their way.

When I talk about power, I'm not talking about namby-pamby _legal_
power.  I'm talking about raw *physical* power.  From a practical point
of view, what's written on a piece of paper is irrelevant if I'm
confronted with armed men who are willing to ignore it.

Why?  Is it insane not to trust in the state?  *You yourself* have
pointed out why we cannot trust those organizations called states.  If
I'm insane, you appear to be schizophrenic. ;)

You are forgetting *social* mechanisms.  You are assuming that everyone
won't care if one of their friends is hurt.  You are assuming that
people will never take action against those who they percieve to be
threatening or harming them or their friends.  These assumptions are
*invalid*.

You misunderstand what is meant by the "initiation of force".  If I were
to attack you, it would be I who would be initiating force, not you. 
The force you use in response to my initiation of force would not have
initiated the conflict, thus you are not initiating force.

Nope.  Theft is an initation of force against my property.  If I happen
to be there, it would usually involve the initiation of force against
me, as I would probably desire to keep my property.

Again, I apologize for using the word "morality", since it obviously
triggers your religion button.

Afraid not.  Just because there's more than one X out there doesn't mean
that Y is still a good thing to do.  If there is a sufficient number of
Z's who are willing to ostracize any X who does Y, then X is given a
strong motivation to not do Y, lest X end up starving and alone.

If, however, very few people consider Y immoral, then X will have no
problems.  Any Z's who treat X badly for Y will tend to be shunned by X
and his friends, putting pressure on the Z's to mind their own business.

This an example of a negative feedback loop --in stark contrast to the
positive feedback associated with the level of corruption in a state.

No, I never painted it that way.  This is what *you* associate with
anarcho-capitalism.

This is not the optimal strategy.  The optimal strategy is to warn your
neighbors, or call the neighborhood security service.  You do this
because you want them to do the same for you, should you come under
attack.  This is why most primates (specifically humans) live in groups
--it's easier to see the predators coming with everyone watching, and
it's easier to fend them off if everybody picks up a stick.

Fortunately, most people are already programmed to behave in a social
fashion (the ones who weren't got eaten 40,000 years ago).  The scenario
you paint above relies on the assumption of a sudden change in human
nature, if the all protecting state were to evaporate.  This is an
incorrect assumption.  Many have been the times that people have thought
they could change human nature, and equally many are the failures.

Except, as I've pointed out, it is *not* the optimal strategy.  Perhaps
you would enjoy the works of Richard Dawkins.  He goes into great detail
describing exactly how nonviolent strategies are superior to violent
ones.  I'll just give one example here.

When two bears approach the same berry bush, they do not immediately
start fighting over it.  Instead, they each stick to one side of the
bush, and do not disturb one another.  Why, if your strategy is the
optimal one, would this be the case?  After all, bears are already
pretty good at attacking things.  It would be pretty easy for a
exceptional bear to break this rule, and become dominant over the other
bears, if what you say is true.

But it is obvious that bears *don't* do this.  That any bears or
ancestors of bears that ever did do this were somehow out-competed by
their peaceful counterparts.  Thus it would appear, from available
evidence, that your approach *is not* superior to the peaceful
approach.  Read Dawkins' "The Selfish Gene" for a more in-depth
argument.
