Awhile back I recall reading something about about equipment confication
and that the governemnt was prohibited from conficating the equipment of a
publisher (ie the FED's can't walk in and shut down the NYT by taking
their printing presses).

Can anyone confirm that such a protection exsists? References to any
relevent court cases would be appreciated. Also any information reguarding
on what qualifications one must meet to qualify for such protection.

Perhaps we could set up a CP/Mixmaster newsletter and at least keep the
SOB's from stealing the equipment. :)
