We'd like to get the affidavit, search warrants and complaint 
for the ex-NSA cryptanalyst, David Sheldon Boone, arrested 
for spying to see what the specific allegations are. See court 
docket below. 

News reports say he is being held in Alexandria, VA, so a
lead to a legal doc retrieval service in that area would be
appreciated. 

Or should anyone have the docket-listed docs, copies would be 
welcomed:
