Here is a way for an individual to make money using the eternity service:

1:  Users are charged $/MB/month to store data in the service.

2:  Users are charged $/MB for downloading data from the service.

3:  The source of a data item receives a portion of the download fees
collected for that item as an anonymous payment, or else the money could be
applied toward keeping the data on the service (the option of choice for
the really paranoid among us).

The location of the data should be determined by some sort of random
process, and it should move frequently.  Disallowing one to store one's own
data reduces the number possible locations for the data, and also requires
a mechanism for matching the source of the data to the owner of each node-
both of which are Really Bad Karma.

One could also construct a fee schedule where a higher rate would buy a
higher redundancy level for your data.

The eternity service should be its own remailer network--one that transfers
data as well as e-mail.  The nodes should have constant encrypted cover
traffic between them.
