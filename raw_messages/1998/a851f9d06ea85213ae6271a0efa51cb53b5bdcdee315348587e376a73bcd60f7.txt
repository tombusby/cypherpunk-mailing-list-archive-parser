Wonder what the implications of this are?

So this means they flunked too.  Since having the
DOD non compliant could be a national security risk.
That means they flunked, but we couldn't say so.

How many nukes are going to be checking the number
of days since they last talked to launch control?
What are the chances they are date sensitive?
What happens if they should lose contact for 
greater than a certain number of days?  Do they
assume we've been nuked? How about the russians?
The Chinese?  What if the entire US DOD C&C network
goes down.  Is it an EMP?  Is it infowar?  Is it
Y2K?

I thought SSA was still two years off target.

This A/B/C/D/F stuff worked in school, but on a
complex remediation effort doesn't really mean
anything.

Is that an 'A' for effort?
