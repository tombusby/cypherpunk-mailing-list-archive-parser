Lawmaker warns of cybersex "pregnancy danger"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Citing the case of a woman who claims she got
pregnant from e-mail, an Ohio Democrat called Wednesday for a "chastity
chip" for the Internet. 

Rep. James Traficant, known for his flamboyant rhetoric, gave a brief floor
speech about a woman named Frances who claimed to have gotten pregnant
through an e-mail exchange with a paramour 1,500 miles away. 

"That's right -- pregnant," the Congressman proclaimed, warning of the
dangers of "immaculate reception." 

He called on Congress to go beyond "v-chips" that would protect kids from
sexual content on the Internet, saying: "Its time for Congress to act. The
computers do not need a v-chip. The Internet needs a chastity chip." 

Although Traficant did not say whether he believed the woman's account, he
did say it was "enough to crash your hard drive."
