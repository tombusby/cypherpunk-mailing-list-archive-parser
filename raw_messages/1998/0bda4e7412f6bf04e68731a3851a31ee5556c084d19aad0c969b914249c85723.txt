there's a lot of books out on the subject, but one suitable
for popular interest is "the cosmic code" by Heinz R. Pagels,
it's actually in paperback. does a nice job of giving a
straightforward explanation of bell's paradox/inequality.

the only relevance of QM to this list I can see is the
possibility of computer storage/computation using it.

there's a nice article in discover of jan 1998, p94 on 
Gershenfeld and Chuang's accomplishment of using atomic spin
states to compute the sum of two binary digits. (qubits).
at the rate science is going I'd say that any major
quantum mechanical computation such as factoring a small
number is probably at least a decade away.
