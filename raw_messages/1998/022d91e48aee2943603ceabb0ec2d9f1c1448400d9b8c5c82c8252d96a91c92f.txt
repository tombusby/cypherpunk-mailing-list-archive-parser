The same question can be asked of the shopper who wants the lowest priced
tomato's. It isn't the vendors responsibility to provide those sorts of
mechanism for the consumer (or user of a system). The interpretation of what
lowest price means is so varied that trying to talk of it as some sort of
universal given is like talking about rational consumers. It's a
non-sequitar.

If the consumer wants the lowest price (in their personal estimation) goods
then they have several choices (at least):

 -	They can look for it themselves

 -	They can ask a friend

 -	They can pay somebody else to look for them

 -	Or they can sit back and wait for the relevant production sites
	to contact them (eg Wed's glob of shiney adverts)

There is also the very real question of why would wired allow a 3rd party
sell their product at a lower cost than they can sell it themselves? Not a
rational or good business practice anyway you look at it.

Yeah, so? Just because I window shop in HEB down the street doesn't mean I
am required to buy anything. And if I walk past a shop and don't register
their window display doesn't mean the store lost anything from me - the very
fact that I ignored it means they weren't going to get my money at that
point. Now if they follow me down the sidewalk and bellow at me I can
guarantee that I (and most other folks) won't buy there even if the price is
lower.

I'd say "quit your whinning".
