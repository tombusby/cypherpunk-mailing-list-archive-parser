Senator Grassley

I sent you a copy of the criminal complaint affidavit I sent to judge
Hug.

Our NSA lawsuit was mostly done as practice for an upcoming Privacy Act
violation/defamation lawsuit.

Dear Mr. Spellman:

March 18, 1998 I phoned the Inspector General's hotline.

I filed a verbal criminal Privacy Act violation complaint with Wanda.

Wanda told me you were going to be the investigator.

Monday March 23 you phoned me to leave your office number.

You phoned several days later.

I told you about the false and defaming documents both Sandia National Laboratories and EEOC Phoenix employees Burtner and Larry Trujillo released without my written permission.

You asked that I send you a copy of these documents.

I mailed them to you the same day.

You told me that you had been reading about this case on  Internet at jya.com and aci.net/kalliste.

On April 3 I phoned to inform your office that a criminal complaint affidavit was filed with judge Hug on Monday April 1 naming those involve in the release of the documents and those who did not properly prosecute those involved..

I mailed a copy of the criminal complaint affidavit to you.

I have not heard from you either in writing or by phone since our initial contact.

Therefore, I ask that you write me and tell me about the status of your investigation.

And, of course, I feel that this unfortunate matter should be promptly settled.  I invite settlement negotiations of the civil aspects of this criminal release of documents.

Sincerely,



William H. Payne
