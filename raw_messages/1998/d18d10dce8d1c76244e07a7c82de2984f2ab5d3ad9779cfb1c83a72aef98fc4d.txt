What else should the sheeple expect? They've let the cops and narcs expand
their power for the past several decades.

Thoughtcrime means your house gets taken away...why didn't Orwell think of it?

(Before anyone claims that downloading certain images may be more than
thoughtcrime, bear in mind that the age of consent may be different in
other countries and that the antichildporn laws cover cartoons, synthetic
images, and images or representations or even stories...even where no real
human being is used as a model.)

Thoughtcrime.
