That's all fine and dandy, however, we *are* talking about an eternity server
architecture that delivers documents to an end user in a secure manner on
demand with no mechanism, by design, to determine the original source. In
this case there would by definition be *no* history to verify against.

It is in fact this lack of history from the users perspective that causes
the authenticity problem in the first place. Further, a point that seems
to have been forgotten, we are talking about signed and not encrypted
documents. Of course there are some similar problems if we do include the
encryption of the data itself into the protocol.
