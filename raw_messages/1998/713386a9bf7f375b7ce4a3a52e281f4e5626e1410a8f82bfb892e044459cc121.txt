A prime example of DoubleThink, since Key Recovery == backdoor access.

#   Clearly, a balance must be struck between the needs of businesses and
#   consumers and the protection of society as a whole. What is the
#   answer? We believe the answer lies in cryptographic systems that
#   provide trustworthy security services along with lawful access. By
#   lawful access, I refer to a range of technologies designed to permit
#   the plain text recovery of encrypted data and communications under a
                   ^^^^^^^^
#   court order or other lawful means that safeguards civil liberties.

In other words, they believe in cryptographic systems with backdoor access.

The NSA testified to Congress concerning lawful access:

: The Puzzle Palace 
:     Inside the National Security Agency,
:     America's most secret intelligence organization
: Author James Bamford, 1983 revision, ISBN 0-14-00.6748-5
:
: P381-382: NSA Director General Allen testified to Congress that there is no
: statute that prevents the NSA from interception of domestic communications.
: Asked whether he was concerned about the legality of expanding greatly its
: targeting of American citizens, the NSA replied: "Legality? That particular
: aspect didn't enter into the discussions."

The government's idea of "lawful access" is "anywhere, anytime".

#
#   We are not wedded to any single technology approach. Key management
#   infrastructures, key recovery and other recoverable products that
#   provide lawful access are some of the ways to achieve a reasonable
#   balance. We believe that seeking industry-led, market-based solutions
#   is the best approach to helping law enforcement.

Oh dey do do dey?

The US Government insists on the capability

   "to decrypt anything, anywhere at any time"

he said.

Gosh, that doesn't sound like they believe "market-based solutions"
are the best approach, does it?
