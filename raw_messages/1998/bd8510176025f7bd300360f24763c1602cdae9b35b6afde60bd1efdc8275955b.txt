See you got the Saturday fax.

Glad you enjoyed the hat I sent you  ...

For the record, Patty is my SAME wife since 1962,

Patty and I met John Gilmore http://www.cygnus.com/~gnu/
and his girl friend Cindy for dinner in about October.

It took about 15 minutes for Patty and I to discover if Gilmore and his
girl friend were of THE SAME SPECIES.

I am a TOTAL CONSERVATIVE.  

I FINALLY saw J Orlin Grabbe on 60 Minutes tonight.

Looks like he may be from a different spicies too.  

But from our minds, Gilmore, Grabbe, and LOTS OF YOU
think the same thoughts.  

And likely John Young too. Good ones.  No evil.

I need to collect my thoughts after seeing 60 minutes tonight.

Best
