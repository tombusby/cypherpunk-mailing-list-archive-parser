Well there are a couple of different approaches depending on the
environment of the transaction.

If it is what I call a "cash and carry" environment where you, the
merchant, and the product are all physically in the same place then the
transaction can take place as any cash transaction would. the merchant
gives you the product, you give him the e-cash bits and the transaction is
done.

If the environment is a "mailorder" environmet where you and the merchant
are in remote locations then there are two different approaches:

- -- COD:

  You place the order, the merchant delivers it. At the time of delivery
you pay for the product.

- -- Escrow:

   You place the order. After placing the order you transfer your e-cash
bits into an escrow account. When the merchant has verification that the
bits are in escrow he ships the product. Upon recept of the product you
release the funds from the escrow account and the merchant is paid.

    Now with escrow based system you can be more creative with the product
insurance end of things. You an the merchant may agree that there will be
a 30 day trial period where the funds will stay in escrow and during that
period you can judge the quality of the product. If a complaint is filed
with the escrow agent within the 30 day period then you would have X
number of days to return the product and get your money back. Merchants
could set up warranty insurance where x% of sales are kept in an escrow
account to cover returns/warranties. All kinds of fun stuff could be done.
