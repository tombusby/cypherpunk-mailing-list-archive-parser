But if the feds pull similar bullshit as with crypto work he'll have to
give up US citizenship to do the work. The regs for crypto appear to make
it such that even if I live permanently outside the US I can not work on or
produce crypto related products even if they are based on non-US
technologies. It seems that being a citizen of the US is less and less
attractive every day...
