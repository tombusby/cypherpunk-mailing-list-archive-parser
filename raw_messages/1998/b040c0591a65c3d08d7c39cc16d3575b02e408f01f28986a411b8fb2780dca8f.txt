Since "Megan's law" where an effort has been made to warn residents
of a convicted child molester living in their neighborhood, I can
well imagine that many of them have resorted to using aliases.

Another possibility is that since so many of them have multiple
convictions on their rap sheets, and since the data entry operators
cannot always read an officer's handwriting, multiple *POSSIBLE*
birthdates for the same perp sometimes float around in the system.
