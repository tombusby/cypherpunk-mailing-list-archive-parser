I suspect one day someone will be saying something similar about the
net.

I have a small TV and cable, which sits a few feet away from my computer.
If I could, I'd just fly around the country going to Mets and Yankees
games.. and of course during the "slow season" I can always go to football
games. 

TV is what you make of it. I suppose if a kid sits in a room by himself
and vegges out in front of it, it does more harm than good.. on the
other hand, when you're 15 years old and can't talk to your dad about
much because its just that time in life, I'd be willing to bet baseball
or sports is still neutral enough territory. I don't see much wrong
with crowding around the idiot box as a family or group, if it gives
people something to talk about. Politics and religion can be fun now and
then, but we all get weary of fighting the same battles. 

Sure, lots of TV is garbage.. but hell.. look around.. a whole lot of
the net is too. 

It isn't TV's fault, and it isn't the net.. the reason why so many things
suck is because we made them. More often than not, we're the garbage.

hmm.. I had hoped this message might be uplifting. Guess not.
