I agree with you completely when you state that religion, ethics, and 
law are distinct and different things.  Unfortunately in the United 
States they have a strong tendency to become intertwined.  The law as it 
stands is that impeachment is only to be used in cases of high crimes 
and misdemeanors.  Now I have not read the entire Starr report nor do I 
have a sophisticated background in law nevertheless nothing Bill has 
done seems to qualify as worthy of impeachment under the law.  However, 
the sexual acts and behaviour exhibited by him is deeply repugnant to 
many on ethical grounds and particularly repugnant to Christians 
specifically.  I do not have any problem at all with those who are 
disgusted by the presidents behaviour on ethical or religious grounds, I 
personally find it repulsive.  I do however feel, as I believe you are 
saying also,  that the law is law.  It should be executed in a fair and 
just manner and according to the letter ( which may or may not lead to 
impeachment ).  The previous poster to which I replied seemed to be very 
clearly stating that his personal religious code of ethics took 
precedence over american legal codes,  a viewpoint which I cannot agree 
with.  All debate on the precice origin and validity of 'seperation of 
church and state' aside I cannot recall any part of the constitution 
which invokes divine justice.  The impeachment issue is not one of 
ethics or religion, simply law and law alone.
