Easily. The acceptance of freedom of speech is not equivalent to the
acceptance to spend and earn money freely and without regulation.

Speech and money are *not* equivalent.

This is as specious as Vulis' argument that these positions are equivalent
to pregnancy in the logical realm, in short you are or aren't. The reality
is that few people, other than statists or extremists look at the world let
alone their personal beliefs in that simplistic fashion.

I believe in the unregulated exercise of speech, including the dissemination
and use of crypto technology. To do otherwise implies some sort of ownership
of the individual by the society doing the regulating. Clearly an incorrect
conclusion. The ability of those same groups to spend their money as they
see fit is not supportable by that same logic. Groups must have regulated
monetary systems or else they collapse because of the monopolization and
therefore loss of vitality of markets. To believe otherwise is to accept the
premise that these monopolies could somehow buy an individuals rights.
Clearly a result even a market anarchist can't accept.
