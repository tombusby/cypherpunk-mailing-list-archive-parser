Huh?

I'm just a pissed-off white guy.

And what makes you think Vulis will
not continue to post to the list?

You clearly HAVE NO IDEA WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

Information Security has no idea why the list owner didn't succeed.

PSINet terminated Vulis for stalking, which I
documented he did to a minimum of four people.

It took me three traffic analysis reports to convince them.

"Fire One" was a success.
