MSDN Flash TIP
================================================= 
BE CAREFUL WHEN COMPARING STRINGS
from Visual J++ Developer's Journal

Java allows you to compare two String objects, strng1 and strng2 using
the following code:

  if(strng1 == strng2) then
  ...

Unfortunately, the effect may not be what you want. The code above
actually compares the String locations, not their text value. To compare
the text values, use this:

  if(strng1.equals(strng2)) then
  ...
