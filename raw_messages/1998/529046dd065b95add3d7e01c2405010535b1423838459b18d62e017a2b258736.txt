Someone having looked over the shoulder of one Linda Reed--PCC West Campus 
CSC, getting her password, and then using her mail account, drooled with 
paralytic tongue as follos:

What color are your glossy glasses, by the way?

In addition to "FreeIncomeTaxReturnForms", they also let me urinate in the 
national forests too.

Doesn't that count for something?  Be all you can be, right?  Excellence 
in being immoral is certainly better than being mediocre at being immoral.

Is this sort of like Reagan arranging with the Iranians that the Tehran 52 
could come home for Christmas, but not before?

And while having mentioned the cheese head, could you possibly do a piece 
on Reagan, by the way?  Now *that* is something I could enjoy reading.  
And really let loose with the prose, if you please:  the more insane, the 
more tangential, the better.

Well, the implementation never really does live up to the grand design 
now, does it?  Ask any computer programmer here on this list.

It is a shame that we'll all just have to endure.

Maybe you're not so crazy after all.  You know, it's not too late to enter 
the race for 2000.  It's a good year to start on, and because of your 
intimate connections with people who are information technology-aware, you 
could make some programmers fabulously wealthy by scamming people on the 
Y2K problem.

US Grant was also a lush.  How prosperous were those times when he could 
pick himself off the floor?

I really am enjoying this.  I had apparently a great deal of spare time in 
the dog days of summer to humor the paranoids of the list although I was 
rather dreading the consequences.

*** Object Lesson:  NEVER ARGUE WITH AN INSANE INDIVIDUAL ***

1. You can never come to a compromise or even win:  it requires that the 
two sides be possessed of reason, and you have only half of what you need.

2. There is a risk that you just might start believing what that 
individual believes, especially when you start conceding small points that 
appear to be the truth.  (Don't be fooled.)

3. It reduces you to a less dignified state before your peers.  And 
appearance is everything.  Remember:  Style, not substance.  Form, not 
structure.

While in substance it is generally all the same, it still amazes
the observer that one will find that smelling one's own is somehow less
disgusting than smelling someone else's.   --Anonymous
