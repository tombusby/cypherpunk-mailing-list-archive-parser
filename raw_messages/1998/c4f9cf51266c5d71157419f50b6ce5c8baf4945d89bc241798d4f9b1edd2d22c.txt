    my oldest son's LAR recon/black unit had been stood down for
    Somalia, gear turned in, etc.  we were finishing Christmas 
    dinner [two additional NCO's who did not live close enough
    to 29 Palms were also guests] --just about 4pm, the 'phone 
    rang...  I knew, and they knew. Bush had decided to go to 
    Somalia and the powers grabbed an always on standby high
    power unit: 21 LAV25s, etc.  vehicles and all were on C5s in
    14 hours. 

    having personally received those calls before does not
    prepare you for the call when it is _your_ son heading out
    for his first chance to stare the beast in the face and 
    stand it down...  or come home in a body bag.

    escorting Bush was a piece of cake, but the brass figured 
    they had two of these special recon companies and ordered
    them to secure North Mogadishu --they did and were shipped 
    stateside; then Army's 10th Mountain got its ass kicked for
    some of the dumbest logistics planning, including the pickup 
    armor column getting lost, no water, and no night vision
    goggles...  then Uncle put its tail between its legs and
    came home.

    how do you think the all the families with sons, husbands,
    lovers, siblings, etc. felt with the spectacle of a dead
    (and initially unidentified pending notification of 
    kin) service man out there just doing his duty for
    his country is being dragged around the dirt streets of a
    shithole?  the boy's parents saw it on television before
    the Army could get a man out to their house to tell them 
    (yes, it is done in person).

    my _boy_ came home a changed _man_ after live ammo on live
    targets and no rubber bullets --and did what all returning  
    jarheads do after first blood --got married as soon as 
    possible.

    absolutely. misplaced criticism and a personal offense to me
    as well as all other servicemen.

    it is one thing to deplore the various wars, police actions,
    dirty tricks, etc. which the U.S. Presidents and spook shows
    are always using to defend "our" interests around the world 
    -it is another to criticize and ridicule the men who fight 
    and die. 

    I have no regrets for what I did, and did too well, but I
    sure as hell have regrets for whom it was done: total
    sleezeballs who have taken TR's maxim to mean: "speak loudly 
    and use a big stick" --it's only business, son.

    well, on this point, the thorn of what is "wisely" is 
    defined differently by everyone; freedom of speech is just
    that-- if we restrict Tim's, then we lose our own freedom.

        Tim gets to say his piece, 
        and we get to lump it      --or lump Tim.
