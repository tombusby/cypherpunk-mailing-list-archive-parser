A reporter (jswartz@sfgate.com) is writing an article about Dianne
Feinstein and her puzzling stance on high tech issues, given the state she
represents. She's taken very odd positions on encryption, Net-gambling,
privacy regulations that put burdens on business, and of course her
bomb-making ban. 

If you have Feinstein stories or opinions, I'm sure he'd love to hear from
you.
