Regarding Daily Ministry Messages

According to Research 50 percent of the U.S. population, or 135 
million people, will communicate by email by 2001 and 30 million 
use email now. 

You can fully test a Free working version of a fine established 
professional bulk e mail program that both sends and collects.  
You can market your product to millions without .32 cent postage 
stamps required. A million letters would cost you $320,000 just 
in stamps, plus the time to stuff and address.  
Bill Gates owner of Microsoft says their will only be two types 
of businesses by the year 2000. Those that use E Mail and those 
that went out of business. 
Give us a try, e mail is the coming thing and I believe you will 
be pleasently suprised. It's a great tool for daily ministry 
messages.  The product is also free for 10 days so you can 
download at this site and test it.
