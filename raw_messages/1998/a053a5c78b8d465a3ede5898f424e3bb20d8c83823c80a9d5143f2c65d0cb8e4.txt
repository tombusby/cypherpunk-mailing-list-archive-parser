I think a distinction needs to be made between what they (the Sheeple{tm})
NEED and what they "Request for Convenience". Wrongfull lawsuits and
welfare careerists in mind, I think this is an important distinction.

Not so fast, Kimosabe- what business would rule against itself a la the
Supreme Court against Congress, when a business decision was spiritually
and/or lawfully in violation of the constitution and legitimately passed
laws enacted since its inception???

This goes back to the "what they NEED vs. what they request for convenience
(theirs)" argument.

definitely a problem. Should AP politics apply??? What would be the method
of redress for infractions that were so heinous that the perpetrator was
deemed untrustworthy and removal from office the only recourse? Who would
"remove" the heinous individual for incarceration in an appropriate
facility??? Who would decide that such action was warranted???

Perhaps we should view the internet as a wedge, not as the fulcrum, lever
and force. I think it would be intuitive, instructive, and demonstrative to
operate on that premise rather than the "here is the internet, my trump
card, I rest my case" style of argument.
