This only applies to semiconductor systems. Also, liquid Nitrogen is cheaper
to purchase than beer, liter for liter. Also with Peltier devices it is quite
possible to keep such systems working for extended periods of time. Simply
review some of the Nitrogen based IR viewing systems that are being used by
amatuer astronomers.

However, there are technologies being worked on now, protein memory for
example, that offer equal 3d packing factors and don't require esoteric
cooling systems.
