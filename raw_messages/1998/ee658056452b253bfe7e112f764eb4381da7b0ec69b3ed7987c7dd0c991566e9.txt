I have felt that way since the early 80's. The rate of technology
multiplication and some of the truly weird technologies that people said
wold never happen are happening.

Don't forget the fact that their test beds were done with *standard* ink-jet
printers with a modified head assembly.

These are some of the exact same questions that I'm trying to add numbers to
myself... when we take the union of the computer, information processing,
networking, bio-engineering, transportation, etc. industries the various
predictions of Toffler and others seem woefuly short-sighted.
