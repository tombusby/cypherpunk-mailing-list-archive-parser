Explain further, from your description of the differences there are no
fundamental mentionings or views of intellectual property. As a matter of
fact the specific role of the individual is never even mentioned in either
definition.

It's almost like there is something poping out of thin air...

So people don't have a right to self-defence? I agree consensual crimes are
not crimes.

Is it? Or is it simply another sort of coercion to cooperate with the
collective? Is it not actualy the embodyment of ideals, an attempt at utopia
if you will?

I'm interesting to see how you reconcile the belief nobody has a right to
use force yet has a right to defend their life.

By facluty I assume you mean our emotional and psychological makeup coupled
with our sensory record of them.

I'd say that such issues are not a facet of individualism but rather a
characteristic of life itself.

As to property, it is a consequence of our biology, if that is a consequence
of our faculties, and not visa versa, I'd doubt.

No it doesn't. You must first prove that a group of individuals have some
right that as individuals they don't have. For one thing, even in your
definition, rights are a fundamental aspect of birth as an individual.

Something I've yet to see.
