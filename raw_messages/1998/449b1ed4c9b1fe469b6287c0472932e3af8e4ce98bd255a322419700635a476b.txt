Actually, I believe it was because what you said was too stupid to be
attacked.. no offense.

The thread was about TEMPEST-related EMR. .. and your quote in question
was:

See.. now.. you're clearly talking about power protection.. but, you see
we _weren't_ talking about power outages, we were talking about
compromising emanations being sent through power lines.. and as far
as the UPS goes, whether or not a UPS would help such muffle such
emanations.

Two completely different things. You may as well have said "Yeah, UPS is
great. They have good rates on ground shipping."

In which case the response of..

> << How many times have you been struck by lightning, Stan?  The effects
> are showing...  >>

..might well be appropriate.
