	IEEE Spectrum of ran a story on this last year.  Apparently they
do have some vacuum tube radio, audio and radar gear, but all the
computer systems in use are solid state such as antique 360s and the
like with lots of custom interfaces that can't be readily replaced.  And
much of the software is such patched spaghetti that nobody has been able
to reimplement it.   But telling is the fact that most of the radar
display consoles are late 60s designs manufactured in the early 70s with
a 5-10 year expected lifetime, and wires and connectors and other parts
not normally replaced in the field are getting brittle with age after
20-25 years of continuous operation at temperature.  And maintaining them
and the computers is made harder each year by the increasingly total 
unavailibility of electronic components of the types used back then...
