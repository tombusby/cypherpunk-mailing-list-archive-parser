Privacy Campaign Plods Ahead
http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/15467.html

By
Niall McKay, niall@wired.com

In the wake of a costly ad campaign designed to raise consumer awareness
about the cryptography debate in Washington, a coalition of Internet
industry companies, privacy activists, and elected officials will turn to
letter writing.

The Americans for Computer Privacy [ http://www.computerprivacy.org/ ] said
Wednesday that the group will send a barrage of missives to the government.
One letter will target every member of Congress and stress the need to
build on recent government policy relaxing encryption restrictions with
"solid legislation."

The group will also call on Vice President Al Gore "to make sure that the
good fight to protect American privacy is regulated."

Americans for Computer Privacy has been waging a public campaign to educate
consumers about the complex crypto issue, in an effort to get grassroots
support behind their drive to liberalize the federal government's
encryption policy.

In July, the group launched a TV and Internet advertising campaign designed
to educate consumers about the need for privacy. The campaign was created
by the public-policy advertising firm Goddard-Claussen, best known for its
"Harry & Louise" commercials. That high-profile series featured a yuppie
couple and aimed to undercut the Clinton administration's health-care
reform initiative.

The current campaign by the Americans for Computer Privacy is reportedly
being closely watched by the FBI and other intelligence agencies. At this
point, it is unclear to what degree the campaign has altered the course of
legislation.

In its latest lobbying effort, the group will urge both the White House and
Congress to reconsider legislation that would ease export restrictions on
strong encryption and ban the imposition of mandatory key-recovery features
in software sold in the United States.

The legislation in question includes such bills as the "E-Privacy Act" (S.
2067), the "Security and Freedom Through Encryption Act" (SAFE, HR 695),
and "The Secure Public Networks Act" (S. 909).

The letters are backed by an unusual alliance of Republican and Democrats
including members of congress Bob Goodlatte, (R-Virginia), Rick White
(R-Washington), Zoe Lofgren (D-California) and Samuel Gejdenson
(D-Connecticut), as well as Senators John Ashcroft (R-Missouri), Conrad
Burns (R-Montana), and Ron Wyden (D-Oregon).
