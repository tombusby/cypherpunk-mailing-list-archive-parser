>    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Census Director Martha Farnsworth Riche, who
>    battled Republican lawmakers over counting methods for 2000, is
>    quitting.
>    
>    Riche said Monday she would leave office Jan. 30.
>    
>    She has been involved in a lengthy dispute with members of Congress
>    over Census 2000, largely over how to count the many people who might
>    be missed by regular methods.
>    
>    The fight focused on a practice called sampling, in which the bureau
>    would determine the number and characteristics of people it cannot
>    reach based on the people it can.
>    
>    Though the practice was endorsed by the National Science Foundation
>    and statistical groups, Republicans in Congress have opposed it,
>    concerned that the result would be more people counted in largely
>    Democratic large cities.
>    
>    The results will be used to redistribute House seats to the states.
