>    
>    LIFE'S CLOCK. Telomeres are repeating DNA strings (TTAGGG) that cap
>    chromosomes. Each time a mortal cell divides, its telomeres become
>    shorter. When they reach a preset length, the cell ceases to divide,
>    ages and dies.
>    
>   Scientists have found a major factor
>   that controls whether a cell dies or thrives
>   
>    It may not sound as appetizing as aquavit, but telomerase--an enzyme
>    discovered only a decade ago in a single-celled protozoan--may well be
>    the elixir of youth. This chemical acts in immortal cancer cells,
>    sperm and ovum to repair telomeres, the strands of DNA that tie up the
>    ends of chromosomes. And now it seems that activating telomerase in
>    sundry other cells grants them a longer lease on life as well.
>    
>    The finding, which was published in the January 16 issue of Science,
>    finally proves what was a highly controversial model linking telomeres
>    to cellular aging. More important, it opens up new avenues for
>    research into diseases that occur when cells grow old, including
>    macular degeneration in the eye and atherosclerosis, and those that
>    arise when cells don't age at all, such as cancer.
