Investigators find "assassination" page on the Web

   Portland, Oregon (AP) -- Three Internal Revenue Service agents and a
   federal magistrate are the targets on what's described as an Internet
   "assassination" Web page.
   
   All four have prices on their heads -- in unusual amounts like 512
   dollars and two cents.
   
   IRS investigators think it was posted by a patient in a federal mental
   hospital.
   
   The page is thought to be from an essay called "Assassination
   Politics." That essay -- written by a jailed tax protester --
   describes a supposedly risk-free way to reward those who assassinate
   public officials.
   
   Anyone who wants to see someone killed contributes to a fund which --
   when large enough -- attracts a killer who predicts the date, time and
   location for the deed to be done.
   
   If it happens, the killer is paid with untraceable digital money.
