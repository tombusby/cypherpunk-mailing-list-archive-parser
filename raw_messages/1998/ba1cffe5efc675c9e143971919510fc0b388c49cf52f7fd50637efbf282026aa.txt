If anybody figures out a way to achieve such security I'd like to know.

As far as I know the only way to keep a box up is to be sure that there are
'works in progress' from users who are not directly involved in the
operation of the system. They are eligible for $1000/day each day they are
deprived of access without a warrant. If they are completely uninvolved it
*might* make a magistrate hesitate about generating a warrant.

As to my subpoena, it looks like I *may* have to do nothing more than sign an
affadavit saying that I didn't participate or discuss the above mentioned
issues with CJ when he was in Austin. I should know more later in the week.
I did find out that the reason they picked me was that when CJ was arrested
he happened to be carrying a copy of the post I did several months ago in
responce to a question regarding destroying floppy drives and computers
using a floppy disk. Apparently they thought I might be some sort of
mad-bomb designer or something. I have to assume that since I wasn't
arrested at the first interview they figured I was reasonably harmless
concerning assaults of the person or helping CJ in a material way.

As to there being wiretaps and permanent LEA monitors on the list, you betcha.

They can take SSZ down or run it themselves (hope they got somebody that
knows Linux 1.1.59 cause otherwise they won't be running it for long) but I
won't participate in entrapment. And I suspect, though I don't know, that my
arrest and lack of interaction with other users would set off flairs pretty
quickly in that case. How long it might take to percolate back to Cypherpunks
I don't have a clue.

One major aspect of all this that I have found particularly unsettling is
that I really don't have family or anybody for support. I think about the
only thing worse than imagining oneself sitting in a jail with no hope of
visitors, letters, etc. is a funeral with nobody there but the preacher.

On a related issue, I have found it somewhat amusing that all the Austin
Cpunks have scattered like a covey of quail. Only one of them even offered
to help (Muchas gracias for the lawyer referals!). I had one person call and
make sure that I knew they weren't at the meeting CJ attended. I'm seriously
considering dropping sponsorship of the local group (and I sure as hell won't
stop to help fix a flat now).

That means there are over 900,000 state, country, and municipal prisoners
since there are over 1M in jail today. 

For a democracy that's incredibly damning. Legalize consenual crimes!
