	So leaders should be able to do whatever they want within their own
borders w/out the possibility of being held responsible for what they do to
citizens of other countries who just happen to be visiting?

	What about rule by law?

	So then you admit you were lying about the deaths and blindness
being the cause of regulation, since you claimed it happend in the late
1800's & early  1900's, but the regualtion and taxing went all the way back
to the middle ages?

	It INHERENTLY recognizes it, and inherently limits it.

	No one has the power.

	THAT'S THE POINT.

	If I got them legally, they were a legal commodity, if I dispose of
them legally, they move from the "white" market, to the "black" market.

	That was my entire fucking point.

	You keep arguing these side points like you don't understand what I
am saying.

	The fact that not everything on the black market was stolen ISN'T
the point, the point is that there can be things on the black market that
aren't stolen, and aren't inherently illegal (tomatoes, vicadan, alcohol)
but are still part of the black market because of the nature of the market
and the legal system.

	FUCKING BULLSHIT. YOu JUST brought introduced your thesis that even
if most stuff isn't actually stolen, then it is bought with money gained by
theft in your last post on this issue. Before that you were maintaining
that everything on the black market had to be stolen, and in fact this
whole side argument occured because you disagreed with me on the fact that
a black market is more defined in terms of the exchange being illegal
rather than the product.

	Tell us Jim, is it a black market if I but a new car, from a
registered dealer, with stolen money? Assuming neither he, nor anyone he
knows, nor anyone I know, excecpt for me, knows the money is stolen?

it's about the trade, the market.

	No it doesn't. It is my contention that in the drug trade, most of
the people buying come by their money thru mechanisms other than theft.
This could be from holding down a Job (as many drug users do),  begging,
prostitution, or other sources than stealing. (there is some SSI diability
fraud there, and I am not denying that theft IS used, just that it's not
the primary method).

	Of the Auto Theft Market. Now find a way to prove what percentage
of that money goes to support the drug trade.

	Then again, it applies equally to yourself, that there really is no
way of knowing.

	No Jim, fences purchase a product for <x> (I am given to understand
that %5 <x < %20 of resale value) and resell it. Brokers arrange for
sale/purchacse.

	Think of a Real Estate Broker. They sell your house, but you keep
possesion of it until sold, and have final say on the purchase.

	What is interesting about that? Just shows that your system doesn't
