An interesting message (well, interesting to me and perhaps to some others).

I've read some reviews of the Dragunov which are very unflattering. The
scope on standard USSR-used rifles was terrible. I could doublecheck what
Plaster says about them, but I haven't seen anyone advocating that
Americans use them. Maybe they'll become the wave of the future...

Actually, I figure that if I'm ever in a situation where I have to engage
multiple targets quickly, I'm probably a goner. If nothing else, they'll
roll an armored vehicle in (and more and more SWAT teams have them) and
burn me out, Waco-style.

Yeah, I think an AR-15 (or variant, of course) makes more sense for the
average person than anything else (incl. shotgun) for home defense.
Opinions vary on this, but this is my conclusion.

Well, I could justify buying _one_ Remington 700, for $600, plus another
$400 or so for the Leupold scope (not bought yet). But I sure as hell
couldn't justify buying a $10K PSG-1!!!

Nice parallels, though I tend to argue for crypto in terms of speech and
First Amendment grounds, and avoid the (obvious, but dangerous) comparisons
of crypto to firearms.

Dangerous because one immediately runs into the "But we regulate machine
guns, so if crypto is like a machine gun, why shouldn't it be regulated?"
And "We don't let citizens have nuclear weapons, so why let them have
military-grade unbreakable ciphers?"

The speech issues and prior restraint issues are much cleaner.
