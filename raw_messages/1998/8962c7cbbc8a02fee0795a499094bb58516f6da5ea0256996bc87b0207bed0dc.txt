Dear Telecommunications Customer,

may dial 1010948, then 1+ the area code/phone number to enjoy a NO
NONSENSE, 8.9 cent per minute, 24 hour per day, 7 day per week, rate on
all state-to-state calls.

COMPARE & SAVE up to 60%: the average national interstate calling
rate offered is more than 20 cents/min.  You'll save up to 60% by just dialing
our 7 digit access code before each long distance call you place.

                            ******* IMPORTANT:  *******

YOU MUST first REGISTER your phone number (NOT switch carriers) by
calling TOLL FREE:

                              1-800-959-1469

Once you have tried the service and you are happy with it, *IF YOU
WISH*, you may switch over (so you won't have to dial the 1010948 access
code) by dialing: 1-800-959-1423.

Otherwise, simply dial 1010948 AFTER you have REGISTERED each phone
number you wish to call from, by calling 1-800-959-1469 NOW!!!

All calls will be billed on your local telephone bill.

Thank you for your time. We are sure you'll enjoy the crystal-clear, and
most importantly, economical service.
