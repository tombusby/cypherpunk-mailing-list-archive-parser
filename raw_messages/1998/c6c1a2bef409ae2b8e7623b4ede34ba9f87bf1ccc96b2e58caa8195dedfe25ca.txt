Well let's see....

control over some geographic area

arbitration of conflict

tithe from the inhabitants of that area

regulation of economic systems by controlling the medium of trade (ie money)

No, government control economies that's not the same thing as having
re-allocation of wealth as a goal. That's more a responsbility of a business
than a government. Governments, at least in principle, are concerned with
stable economies and the continued existance of same. Who exactly, if
anyone, is holder of that wealth is in principle irrelevant to the
definition of political systems as a general expression of human psychology.

Though it is clear the devil is in the details.

It sounds like an expression of the social aspects of human psychology.
Whether it's a church, industry consortium, local LEA, local fire dept.,
etc.

Who cares whether it's heirarchical or flat (as in an anarchy or
free-market). The point is that abuse takes place.

It is no more ethical to bash somebodies brains in under an anarchy than it
is in a democracy or a communicsm.

Sounds like an expression of the range of human beliefs. Whether something
is right, wrong, stupid, etc. is a function of individual statements of
importance and ranking of consequences.

Which unfortunately includes the neighbor being able to take your property
by force since he believes it's right.

Tell that to the mother of the kid who got killed last night because he had
something somebody else wanted. Also explain to here how under an anarchy
there isn't any recourse for her other than to try to find that person
herself and kill them....

Yep, that is a very efficient and ethical system you wanna build.

 My statement above simply lays out the position having Privacy

Freedom is the right to do what you want *WITHOUT* impinging or otherwise
limiting others right to express their desires and wants.

Anarchy clearly won't do that.

If privacy exists you don't have to hide things because nobodies looking in
the first place.

You only need to hide things if you're reasonably certain somebody else
wants it.

> 	There are varying degrees of Privacy, from "Well, at least they

Yep, like there are varying degrees of pregnancy. Either somebody is looking
or they aren't.

No, that is varying degrees of *respect* for privacy. Not the same animal at
all.

> 	Freedom is the ability to make choices, and exercise those choices.

Without impinging on others freedom.

It's worth noting that anarchist don't add that last one in there because it
blows their whole little house of cards completely away.

No, there are varying degrees of respect for freedom.

Sure it is, because under anarchy there is no protection that one persons
expression won't interfere with anothers expression without resorting to
violence.
