	I don't think I'll bother the list with this, but a big problem
with cellphones is that people have cellphones.  And cellphones are
generally not designed to be tamperproof (in many cases little or no
effort in this cost competitive market has gone into this) so making
a real cellphone serve as the front end to a snooping system has and will
be done and in fact be the easiest hack engineering solution.

	There are lots and lots of people who like to be spectators
and are keenly interested in other people's affairs.  All of us are
to some degree - witness the feeding frenzy over the Monica affair -
and some guestimates have estimated that perhaps as much as 40% of
analog cell calls near large cities are being eavesdropped on by
at least one other person.

	That problem is getting worse rather than better.  The media 
depiction of the mysterious "hacker" long haired mad kid intent on evil
invasion of the worlds computers is helping create the illusion
that there is a separate techno criminal class.  But the reality is
that more and more people are crossing the barriers that the older lawyers
in congress never tried to cross and learning something about technology 
and software.   And these people are the guy next door with the cute
kids, not fringe crazies.   And the evil net allows information to
become available much more widely than before.

	From my perspective, there are deep divisions and ambivalences
in what the US people will tolerate.  They hate the idea of being spied open
but buy nanny cams and gobble up spy novels and TV shows.   They purchase
millions of police scanners and react in horror when Linda Tripp tapes 
a conversation to protect her ass.   And they expect the US government
to be on top of events around the world and have inside knowlage of 
other governments and react in horror when their spies are unmasked
within our walls, and their eavesdropping gets shown on the nightly
news.  And cities install more and more cameras and bosses read more
email and listen to more calls on business phones every year.

	Yes, its definately sausage but it tastes good...

	That is true, and it is also sadly true that a lot of their
effort has gone into frank deception, and active determined efforts to block
those of us who have been fighting for incorperating at least minimal
crypto communications security into the infrastructure.

	The Internet is ending this era, however, because it is no
longer possible to control the flow of information and news about 
communications security and crypto, and slowly the holes will get
plugged.

	This is happening, and that is why Louie is grabbing desperately
for the last chance... and why congress is busily passing anti scanner
bills to solve the cellphone privacy problem that don't mention a thing
about cryptography.

	Their desparate hope is if they say it solomnly enough and with
enough ceremony the public will see the emporer's clothes
