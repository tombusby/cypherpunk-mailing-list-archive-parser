				ARTICLE I. 
 
	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, 
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of 
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, 
and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. 
 

				ARTICLE X. 
 
	The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, 
nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, 
or to the people.

The 1st prevents the government from regulating religion, even to the point
of having the authority to define what a religion is. This includes smoking
dope, raping little babies, whatever. It *IS NOT* an issue within the
guidelines of the Constitution for the *federal* government, Period, end of
story. Note that it does *not* prevent religions from participating in the
government. They could regulate any commerce of those churches that cross
state lines.

The 10th says that unless the state you happen to live in regulates religion
through a representative form of government via their own constitution then
the practice and limits of religion are to be decided by the individual.

Don't like it?

Get a god damned amendment passed modifying or nullifying one or both of the
above amendments.
