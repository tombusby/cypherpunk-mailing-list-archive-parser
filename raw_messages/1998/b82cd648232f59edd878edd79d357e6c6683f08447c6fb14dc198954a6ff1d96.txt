All of them.

If you take a look at _Applied Cryptography (2nd Edition)_, you will find a
number of different methods that have been used against FEAL.

It seems that whenever someone comes up with a new method of cryptanalysis,
they use it on FEAL first.  (Or at least it seems that way...)

There are much better solutions.  Unpatented ones as well...
