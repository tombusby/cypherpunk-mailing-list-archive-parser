And the Caribbean.  Passport issuance is increasing by about 18% per annum because of a number of different trends.  International travel is way up, many new citizens want the passport as easy proof of citizenship without the stigma of the naturalization certificate, native-born Americans who now have to frequently present ID are also turning to the passport.  A passport is a single document that can be used to prove identity *and* right to work in the US when filling out the I-9 form for a new job.

Kids still get five-year passports.

Even though I naturally oppose government ID requirements, the passport does have certain advantages for those few times when I "need" government ID.  A passport has no useful information on it aside from name and DOB.  There is no address (unless you write one in the "if lost, return to" section.  No SS#.  The Passport number is not linked to many "useful" databases.  It is not part of the DMV social control system that has grown up around the Driver's License.  It is unchallengeable.
