Subject: Got your message
:

Thanks for your message.  Sometimes it takes a day or two to get through 
all my email.  I will get back to you, or have someone from our company 
get back to you, as quickly as I can.   Thanks for your patience.  If you 
need to speak with someone immediately, please call our corporate offices 
at 408 988-3832 [called, got voicemail: closed until Monday.].  If you need 
to contact me by phone, see the contact information on my web page at 

http://www.pgp.com/phil.

In December 1997 my company, Pretty Good Privacy Inc, was acquired by 
McAfee Associates, which is now known as Network Associates [ref. kra.org].
If you haven't seen it already, you should take a look at the latest 
version of PGP, version 6, available in both commercial and freeware 
forms, for Windows and Mac, available for Web downloading from our 
company's web site at http://www.pgp.com.

The best site with the best all-around information about PGP, including
frequently asked questions, is http://www.pgpi.com, which is in Norway.  
They have information on where to get PGP if you live outside of the US or 
Canada, for commercial or freeware use.  They also provide pointers into 
our own domestic web site here to help you easily find where to get the 
latest versions of PGP in the US, for business or freeware.  They also 
tell you how to download the PGP source code for peer review, and where to 
get the Unix versions.  You can also download PGPfone from there.
