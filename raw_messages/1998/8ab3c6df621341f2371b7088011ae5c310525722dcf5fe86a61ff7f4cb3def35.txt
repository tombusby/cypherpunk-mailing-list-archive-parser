Pragmatism, as far as philosophy structure is concerned,  is opportunistic in 
the sense that it gets a free ride on other's failures to come up with basic 
premises that are compatible with reality...

Well, this is a point not shared at all by the collectivistic-oriented 
philosophies, which places the "good of the collective", whatever it may mean,

imposing confiscation, imprisonment and death it to cut them out of their 
tools...
