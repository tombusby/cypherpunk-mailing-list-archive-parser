Ugh, um, ...but he was a nutter, unlike me. ;-)

The other half of the reason I chose the IP list is because
of my dislike of its owner, nutter Michele Moore.

She is trying to profit from a book claiming various government agencies
knew full well the OK Murrah building was going to be blown up, and
purposely did nothing. Trying to profit from other's misery.

(At least my nutter anti-ECHELON "Cryptography Manifesto" is free.)

She also terminated my list subscription when I made a single post
asking for people not to make homophobic posts. She was 100% unforgiving
on this, even though I promised not to make such a post again. She
described the homophobic posts as "Christian". (This was around the time
Pat Robertson made comments about Florida's Disney being hit by God with
hurricanes because of its "gay days" promotion.)

It's also a very high-volume list, and I recently asked her about
posting about car antennas...

I've been snipping down articles a bit since then.

As far as I know, no one has complained about my posts
relative to the new law.
