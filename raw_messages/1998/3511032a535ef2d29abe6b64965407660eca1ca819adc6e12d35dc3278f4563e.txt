Not to bug you personnally, just a comment on the general state of affairs:

IMHO, there is no such thing as "legitimate needs of law enforcement" that
could justify such a limitation of the freedom of the individuals who had
done
nothing wrong.

"legitimate" in our present context means to "counter things that are
presently illegal", notwithstanding that an immense portion of the
population,
which in essence does not try to get a free ride from some sort of law, do
not
agree at all with the said law.

Somehow, I think that it is time to emphasize our taking of the moral high
ground.

Definition:  FACISM: n.:  a political and economic movement, strongly
nationalistic, magnifying the rights of the state as opposed to those of the
individual, in which industry, though remaining largely under private
ownership, and all administrative
political units, are controlled by a strong central government.

"One of the ordinary modes by which tyrants accomplish their purpose,
without resistance, is by disarming the people and making it an offense to
keep arms".  - Joseph Story, U.S. Supreme Court Justice.
        -------------------------------------------------
the German gun control laws were enacted by the "liberal" Weimar Republic
government that preceded Hitler, and were a strong aid to his coming to 
power -- because they disarmed Hitler's opponents, and Hitler's adherents
ignored them -- as criminals have always ignored gun control laws.

Disarming the public is a frequent first step toward dictatorships and
genocides.  Once the disarming is complete, the public is helpless against
those who have the guns.
