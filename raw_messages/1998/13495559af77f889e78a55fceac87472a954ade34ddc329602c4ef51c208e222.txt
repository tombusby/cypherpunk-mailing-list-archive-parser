Nick,

I am somewhat puzzled by your response. Do you assert that a software based
solution, executed on a general purpose CPU under a general purpose OS, can
afford the same protection of whatever the secret in question may be as a
hardware token, such as a smartcard? A hardware token lacking the very API
to extract the secret through software based attacks?

If so, could you please share with us the revolutionary breakthrough in
computer science that negates the effect of decompilers and runtime
debuggers on Arcot's software?

Furthermore, how do you consolidate the claim on Arcot's website that
"ArcotSignTM [...] offers [hardware solution] tamper resistance in software"
with the statement by Arcot's very own cryptographic advisor, Bruce
Schneier, that "Of course. It's less secure than hardware solutions".

Perhaps I have worked in this industry for too long to fully adjust to the
novel genius displayed in "virtual one-time pads", "virtual smartcards", and
"virtual security".

Thanks,
