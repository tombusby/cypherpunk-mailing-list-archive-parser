These bland-info-overloaded days, Blanc:

   The Center of Attention = the Eccentric

You will not be visible, listened to, or read online 
unless you got something deeply offensive to 
say, quote, report, swear to god to, degrading of
self and others, litigable, libellous, insulting, vulgar, 
prohibited by multiple laws, violative of fairness and 
decency, newsworthy, or a well-thought-out alternative 
to sheepledom, Joe Sixdom, PC, MC, Real Identity,
the Tax Code, unequal distribution of wealth, straight
sex, kinky sex, fat, diet, exercise, sloth, grammatical 
rigor, speaking in unknown tongues, numeracy, 
science, art, politics, religion, quantum computing,
nanotech, borderlessness, Y2K, the talk shows,
the amazing future of the Internet.

The center is gone for good, cry a tear, then bravely affirm:
good riddance to Ptolemaic centricity. Normalcy is now para.
Listen to what your teeth are picking up from the spectrum
transmitting to the inner ear bone: the spheres whistling
Dixie in the dark.

Tim's telling what the quarks are whispering.

Tim's an oddball wizard, we're all bank-shot eccentrics, 
no home on earth, we the intergalactic outcasts gumming
the dried teat once unemptiable: faith, self, clan, country,
ideology, bye, bye (white male) American pie.

There's one Rosebud refuge left: the US Senate/Bohemian
Club.
