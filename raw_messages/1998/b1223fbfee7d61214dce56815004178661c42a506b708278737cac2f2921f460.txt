Dear One Nation Supporter in New South Wales,

Hard copy of Helen Dodd's book:
==============================
I was surprised to learn that small number of the limited edition, numbered
(150) copies of Helen Dodd's book "Pauline, the Hanson Phenomenon" signed by
Pauline Hanson are still available. They will definitely be sold out after
this post so get in quick.

The cost is Au$75 each and send you emails to:

camint@geocities.com

(As a matter of interest a $20 copy of Pauline Hanson's "The Truth" recently
sold for $250.)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
One Nation birthday party:
=========================
For those of you ***who are members of Pauline Hanson's One Nation*** we are
holding a celebration of the party's first anniversary over the Easter
Weekend (April 10-12) on Pauline's rural property near Ipswich in South East
Queensland. In true Australian style camping and bar-b-ques under the
starlit sky will be the order of the day. There will be competitions,
entertainment like bush dancing, karaoke and horse racing - and much, much
more. 

If you are interested please contact (07) 3369 8214, 3848 2197, 3399 6662 or

from $55 for the one day to $85 for the three.

Book before you put this one in your diary - once again very limited
numbers! Max of 400 people to be accepted.
