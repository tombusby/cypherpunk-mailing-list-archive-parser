LOWER YOUR CHILD SUPPORT!!!

Don't be a DEADBEAT DAD!!!

Join the FATHERS' RIGHTS COALITION and learn how to legally reduce
your court-ordered child support WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY.Millions of FATHERS 
have been unjustly labeled as DEADBEAT DADS because they cannot afford 
to pay their child support due to factors beyond their control such as unemployment,
under employment, and unforeseen or unexpected expenses.

Most fathers are treated unfairly by the courts because they cannot afford the expense
of an attorney.  Even worse, fathers that employ an attorney to assist them in trying to 
obtain a child support reduction end up having to explain to the court why they can
pay an attorney and not pay child support. 

Failure to fully pay your child support can cause you to lose your drivers, business or
professional license.  As well, owing child support can ruin your credit rating and 
prevent you from obtaining employment.  Your failure to pay all of your child support 
can cause you to be jailed or imprisoned. Ignorance or inaction could totally ruin your life!

For only $49.90 you can join the FATHERS' RIGHTS COALITION and receive with
