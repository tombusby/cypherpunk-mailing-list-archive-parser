This does not answer my original question, which is: what encryption method
are
you using? All it says is which encryption methods you are *not* using.

If I felt that it was highly unlikely, I'd hardly be asking, would I? Poor 
cryptography is worse than none - it encourages people to believe their data
is safe when it is not. Good cryptography can stand up to having its
algorithms
made public. Can yours?

Without providing more information, customers can not make that decision for
themselves.

Then you should be active in political groups advocating change of those laws.
In fact, if you really believe in encryption, you might want to offer this as
a test case - even a reporter can see how silly it is not to be able to
protect
your ATM PIN.

Many strong encryption algorithms are free.

Many algorithms can be tuned for different levels of complexity.

I am doing so. I am also copying this to the cypherpunks mailing list,
as other people ought to be made aware of this issue. Nothing I have quoted
seems to be nonpublic information.
