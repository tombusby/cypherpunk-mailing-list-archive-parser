Now there's a really intelligent response to the MIB! I think Blanc would
have done a better self-service to have responded that way.

MAKE THEM GET A WARRANT! It's your ONLY legal defense against a fishing
expedition! It's our CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to require a warrant before
letting them in! We are NOT criminals just because we do not allow the MIBs
to make ILLEGAL and UNCONSTITUTIONAL searches of our properties!

If they can't convince a judge AND obtain a specifically worded search
warrant then they are obviously fishing! Tell to go find a real deep lake...

I also give the writer an A+ for the Clintonian and Reagonesque touches!

We have learned sooo much from our wonderful President Clinton, haven't we?!

>
>Have you ever heard of a group called the Cypherpunks?
>
>It rings a bell.
>
>Are you a member?
>
>No.

>
>I have no idea. I don't join organizations.
>
>Are you a member of the Majordomo organization?
>
>No. The only majordomo I've ever heard of is a mail list manager.
>
>Where have you seen this Majordomo?
>
>Oh, everywhere. I think it's worldwide in scope.
>
>(scribble scribble)
>
>It's some kind of utility program. Everybody uses it.
>
>(scribbling stops)
>What can you tell us about it?
>
>Nothing, really. If you want to get on a mail list you send a
>"subscribe" message to a majordomo. If you want to get off, I
>think you send an "unscrive" message.
>
>Have you ever done that?
>
>Maybe. I don't recall. Anyone can submit your e-mail address

>
>Spam? (the agents look at each other)
>
>Junk e-mail. I delete most of my e-mail without even reading it.

>
>(scribble scribble)
>So, are you denying being a member of the Cypherpunks?
>
>I don't know what that means.
>
>Have you ever subscribed to the Cypherpunks e-mail list?
>
>I have no idea.
>
>You have no idea? You don't remember?
>
>I don't know what I've subscribed to, unsubscribed from,

>
>May we look?
>
>No.
>
>Are you going to make us get a warrant?
>
>Get what you like. My disk crashed last week and I threw it away.

>
>Columns?
>

>
>(oh shit)
>(scribble scribble)
>Oh yeah? Which ones?
>

>

>

>

>
>I don't recall ever hearing of anything like that.
>
>Do you know who Tim May is?
>
>Nope. Sounds like a real common name, though.
>
>How about Blanc?
>
>Is that French?
>
>Never mind. Thanks. We'll be seeing you.
