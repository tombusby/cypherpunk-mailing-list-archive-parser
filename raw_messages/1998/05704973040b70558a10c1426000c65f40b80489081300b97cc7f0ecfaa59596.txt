Apparently, the password can be up to 80 printable characters in length...

According to one of the READMEs that comes with a public domain
implementation of the PKZIP crypto algorithm, there is a known-plaintext
attack against it described at http://www.cryptography.com/.

If it's 8 or less lower-case letters, it would seem that it's probably
crackable in a reasonable amount of time on a high-end desktop PC or
workstation.  Anything more would probably require a distributed attack.
