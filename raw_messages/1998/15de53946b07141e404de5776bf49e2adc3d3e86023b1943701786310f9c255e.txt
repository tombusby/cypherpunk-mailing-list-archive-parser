 The whole point is that since such a system offers no way to verify
that Alice has indeed at any point given them 'everything' she has to
tell, they will keep beating Alice; Alice, recognizing this at the
outset has no reason to give them anything because she knows that since
she cannot prove she has given them everything they will beat her again
and again no matter what she does. The idea of successive keys unlocking
more and more important data means that she can chose to give them some
of her keys and then just grit out the beatings til they either develop
conscience (unlikely), lose patience, (more likely), or figure they have
gotten all there is to get.

While this method guarantees a beating, it really does offer the best
chance of getting away with the withholding of the most secure keys.

The only chink in the system would be independent knowledge from a
coworker or some such that there is more there.
