Yes, but they don't give you as easily measured level of the incident
radiation.

with a neon bulb or a flourescent tube (what I prefer) you have a hard time
mapping radiation level to brightness with commenly available photometers.
Photo quality stuff isn't nearly accurate enough.

Sand has lots of piezo. You don't want piezo because the ground pressure on
the stake will cause excessive noise.

As to non-conductive, you *WANT* it to be conductive otherwise the signals
will form ground waves and propogate horizontaly. You can see this with
radar signals from aircraft that bounce off the tarmac (I used to live next
to the Austin airport and had access to a spectrum analyzer).

If the ground plane isn't conductive it isn't a ground plane.
