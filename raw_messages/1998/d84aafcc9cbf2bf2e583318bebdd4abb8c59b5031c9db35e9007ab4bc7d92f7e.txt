I somehow missed the full thread on this topic, but I disagree
that "cheaper, as always, *is* better."  There are many markets
and situations where people (Americans included) shop by "value"
(perceived or otherwise), not just price.  This is what VARs and
"branding" are about and what enables market power.

For example, Gerry Heller, CEO of FastParts - an online auction
for semiconductors, was quoted in a recent Forrester Research
report as admitting that even in this commodity-like market
"availability is more important than price" when it comes to
auctioning semiconductors.
