Interactive Industry Leaders and Top Policy Makers to Meet 
at WashingtonWeb Internet Policy Forum

	Washington, DC -- With the mounting interest of 
Washington in the Internet, key policy makers and Internet 
industry executives will come together for a strategic 
discussion about the impact of politics on the Internet.  
Sponsored by the Association for Interactive Media, the 
WashingtonWeb Internet Policy Forum, February 9 and 10, 
1998, is the premier top-level meeting between the 
Washington policy community and the leaders of the new media 
industry.

	"Internet executives and government officials come 
from very different backgrounds.  There needs to be an on-
going dialogue between the users and regulators of this 
powerful medium in order to ensure that businesses may 
continue to grow and serve the public.  The WashingtonWeb 
Internet Policy Forum is designed to facilitate this 
discussion," said Andy Sernovitz, President of the 
Association for Interactive Media.

	Currently, over 300 Members of Congress have co-
sponsored bills regulating interactive businesses.  Federal 
regulatory agencies including the FCC, FTC, NTIA, Treasury, 
Federal Reserve, White House Office of Technology 
Assessment, and the Patent and Trademark Office, are 
considering new legislation and regulation.  Commerce on the 
Net will be forever shaped by the dozens of bills, 
regulations, and policy directives that are already on the 
table.  Participants will have the opportunity to interact 
with the very legislators and regulators who will make these 
decisions.

	A partial list of topics to be discussed at 
WashingtonWeb include:  Pending Legislation and Regulation: 
The Industry Response; Potential Expansion of FTC and FCC 
Jurisdictions; Taxing the Internet; Beltway Wonks vs. Web 
Gurus; Consumer Concerns and Industry Self-Regulation.  
Speakers (to date) include:  Representative Rick Boucher; 
Adam Theirer, Heritage Foundation; Adam Clayton Powell III, 
The Freedom Forum; Pete DuPont, IntellectualCapital.com.; 
Robin Raskin, Editor & Publisher, Family PC Magazine; 
Kenneth Dotson, CBS Sportsline; and Gordon Ross, NetNanny.  
Sponsors include:  Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, Policy.com, 
CNN/Time All Politics, Net Nanny, IntellectualCapital.com, 
and Exodus Communications.

	The WashingtonWeb Internet Policy Forum will be held 
February 9 and 10, 1998, at the Willard intercontinental 
Hotel in Washington, DC.
