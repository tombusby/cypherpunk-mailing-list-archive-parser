JVM, 8-bit processor, 6k SRAM, some tamper-resistant features,
RTC, and 1024-bit math accelerator in a US$50 ring.  Cool.

I remember someone telling me recently some MIT folks had done some
research in using the human body as a communication bus.
That seems like a synergistic technology to wearable crypters.
