Uh, how does one read this in Lynx? The first page instructs you to choose
your nearest location. The "Mirror Sites" page is an image map. Chosing this
"image map" will pop up a series of selections like "(318,85)" and chosing
one of these dies with a 404. There are four options below that: "Russia," 
"France," "Brasil," and "Japan." 

Chosing one of these brings you to a bunch of frames which aren't even named
sanely. Frame "ob_li" has nothing in it. Frame "links" has nothing in it.
Frame "un_li" has nothing in it. Frame "oben" has nothing in it. Is anyone
beginning to see a pattern?

Nearest I can tell, the people running enemy.org are just as clueless as the
people programming at Microsoft. It's possible that they're even more
clueless. If they want to attack Microsoft, they need to learn how to make a
web page first.
