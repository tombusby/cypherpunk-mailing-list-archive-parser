Hm, interesting choice of terms for comparison. So you're admitting that
anarcho-whatever isn't a social do-gooder, the intent is not to make the
system better or more equitable. Rather you're admitting, apparently
tacitly, that the goal of the anarcho-whatever is personal rather than
social improvement. There is also a further tacit admission with this
system won't address the social ills that plague us currently.

I must admit I'm impressed. In a couple of days I've run across two seperate
anarcho-whatever supporters who admit their proposal won't address the
social ills but rather leaves them up to chance. That's more than in the
last 20 years.

I'd like a reference to this particular list if possible.

I'd ask the same question of the anarcho-whatever but you took care of it so
adroitely above...
