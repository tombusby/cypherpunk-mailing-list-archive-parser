Who has both the motive to deny economic reality and the power to do so
in the short term?

Who controls it, how and why?

Capitalism and democracy have nothing to do with each other.

"capitalism is...the mortal enemy of ...the market."

"capitalism is...the mortal enemy of ...the [free] market."

"capitalism is...the mortal enemy of ...[free] market [capitalism]."

"capitalism is...the mortal enemy of ...[capitalism]."

Hmmm, there is a problem here.

"[Modern pseudo-]capitalism is the mortal enemy of [free] market
[capitalism]."

There, that works.

Money can't rule, it is not sentient. Who controls money?

I can't believe after 69 years people are still shoveling the same
socialist and protectionist bullshit.

I cannot figure out how someone can get so close to pointing on the
problem with [modern] capitalism and still come to all the wrong
conclusions.

I've never seen populism and [free] market economics twisted together so
perversely.
