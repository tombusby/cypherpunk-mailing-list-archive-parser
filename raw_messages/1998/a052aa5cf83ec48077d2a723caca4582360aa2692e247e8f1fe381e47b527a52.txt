Oh yeah...

Software development is a long way from selling software, not the same
animal at all.

I mean when I go down to the dozen computer stores within a mile or so of my
house I am truly deluged by software from countries outside of the US and
Canada. I mean we have all heard of the Indian and Bulgarian software
billionares haven't we? And all those folks in Turkey just rolling in
cash...

Further, who do the majority of these folks who actualy make a reasonable
living work for either directly or under contract? Large US and Eurpean
countries thats who.

That's why those folks can make a living developing (not selling) software.

I can tell how often you buy perfume, the ones I buy for my girlfriend
certainly have a little 'c' on them... And as to the number of companies
that are actualy developing perfume versus reselling it under their own
house brands...there might be a couple dozen succesful (say stay in business
more than 5 years) in the whole world and I would go so far as to hypothesize
that if one were motivated to plot the number of companies per year over the
last say 50 years you would see the number go *down*.
