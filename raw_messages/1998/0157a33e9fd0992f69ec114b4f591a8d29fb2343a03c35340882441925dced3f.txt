Announcing:  WWW CRYPTOGRAPHY ARTICLE DATABASE

Counterpane Systems
http://www.counterpane.com/biblio/

Counterpane Systems has created an extensive bibliography of links to 
cryptography papers available on the World Wide Web.  We hope to 
build a comprehensive database of published papers available on the 
net, organized both by author and by year.

Users can view the bibliography by author (every author is indexed, not 
just the first author) or by publication year.  There will also be a single 
page containing all the citations, to facilitate searching the full bibliography 
(by keyword, for example) with your browser's search function.

Counterpane wants this database to be a research tool for the community, 
and for it to be continuously updated.  We will frequently monitor the 
WWW for new articles for our database.  Researchers can also submit 
articles for inclusion in the database using an on-line form; see the 
webpage for details.

Please help.  If you have papers on the Web, please submit them into 
our database.  If you know of any archives of papers that I missed, 
please let me know.  If there are any features you'd like to see, please 
suggest them.

Future enhancements include grouping of papers by subject, the 
inclusion of searchable paper summaries, and the ability to comment on 
research papers.  We hope to also broaden the scope of the database 
to computer security in general.

Please take a moment to try out the Counterpane Cryptography Article 
Database, and let us know what you think.


Thank you,
Bruce Schneier
