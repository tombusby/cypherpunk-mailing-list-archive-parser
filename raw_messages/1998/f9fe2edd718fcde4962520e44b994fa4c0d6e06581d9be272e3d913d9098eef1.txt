>    This is going to be the year of free software. I have honestly come to
>    believe that. The free software movement is about to make tremendous
>    gains in respect and mindshare in realms where it has long been
>    ignored. Big software firms may want to start worrying, because the
>    world is changing around them.
>    
>    Anybody who didn't read Eric S. Raymond's The Cathedral and the Bazaar
>    paper should go and do so now. It describes the Linux development
>    model nicely, as well as the reasons for the success of that model.
>    Netscape has credited this paper with being a crucial influence in
>    their decision to free the source to their browser.
>    
>    As of this writing, Eric is evidently in Silicon Valley discussing
>    licensing terms with Netscape. The word is that he is also meeting
>    with several other "leading Silicon Valley CEO's" to discuss the free
>    software model. One wonders who else may decide to adopt the bazaar
>    model of development.
>    
>    Whether or not other firms follow Netscape in the near future, free
>    software now has a visibility that was lacking before. Peruse the set
>    of articles listed below, and you'll see what we mean. This can only
>    be good for the Linux world, as the validity of its model of
>    development gains the recognition it deserves. It's looking like
>    interesting times.

>    David Miller, the force behind the Sparc and SGI ports, finally
>    resurfaced after a longish, low-profile period. To see what he has
>    been doing, check out the Cobalt Micro page. I don't know anybody who
>    has actually run one of these cool, blue Linux boxes, but they look
>    like a fun toy...

>    Does unix need to be rescued from the hackers?. This item isn't
>    particularly new, but Michael Hoffman's article on the need for a
>    seamless graphical user interface for unix systems is still good food
>    for thought. Another person, Perry Harrington, would like to replace

> Linux in the news
> 
>    Wired news ran an article on free software last week. The obvious
>    point of interest was Netscape, but Linux rated some favorable mention
>    as well. It's a reasonable discussion of the merits of free software
>    in general.
>    
>    Accolades from the Emerald Isle. An article in the Irish Times
>    financial section is also favorable toward Linux, explicitly as an
>    alternative to NT. I assume that "Linux remains at the coalface
>    technologically [...]" is a positive thing...
>    
>    There is a four-part series on free software in news.com this week.
>    It's a reasonably good and sympathetic series, despite its title:
>    "Socialist Software."
>    
>    Many of us have heard the old argument: "There is no technical support
>    for Linux." Well, then, why has Infoworld awarded its 1997 technical
>    support award to the Linux community? It's a great bit of recognition
>    that just because software is free doesn't mean that it's unsupported.
>    Show this one to your boss.
>    
>    Ah yes, and their award for operating systems went to Red Hat 5.0...
>    
>    Two other articles in Infoworld: Nicolas Petreley thinks that
>    Netscape's move could be a winning strategy, while Mark Tebbe talks of
>    the model used by "a renegade OS such as Linux" and raises, you
>    guessed it, the spectre of support.
>    
>    "[Linux] is emerging as a viable competitor to Microsoft's Windows NT"
>    according to an article in the New York Times. Note that this site
>    requires registration now... The old convention of using 'cypherpunks'
>    for the username and password will get you in, if you don't wish to
>    register separately.
>    
>    The folks at TBTF ran a couple of Linux-related articles this week.
>    One, dedicated to estimating the size of the Linux community, comes up
>    with 5-7 million installed Linux systems in the world.
>    
>    We are told January's issue of Sky & Telescope has a nice Linux
>    article in it. We haven't seen it, though; check your local newsstand.
>    
>    
>    CNN's article on top selling software for January includes a reference
>    to Red Hat Linux. It's number three in the "Business Software
>    (MS-DOS/OS/2)" section. "Business software" can almost make sense, but
>    "MS-DOS"???        [Security] A serious X-windows security problem has
>    been reported in XKB, depending on X11 version and environment, which
>    can allow local users to exploit a "feature" XDB to execute arbitrary
>    programs with extra privileges. Quick vulnerability check and fix are
>    provided in the posting to linux-alert. You can also see Red Hat's
>    advisory on this bug.

>    The AT&T Crowds project has chosen linux for their next target. Crowds
>    is intended to protect a person's anonymity as they browse the web and
>    already runs under SunOS, Solaris and Irix.
>    
>    The filter program that comes as part of the elm-2.4 package contains
>    two vulnerabilities, one of which could be remotely exploited. Details
>    here.
>    
>    Michal Zalewski reported a problem with gzexe, part of the gzip
>    package. Seems it uses predictable filenames in /tmp, which may allow
>    users to destroy the contents of files on your system. Use of gzexe is
>    not widespread, but Red Hat recommends upgrading your version of gzip.
>           [Kernel] The current development kernel version is 2.1.85. It
>    includes the ability to boot off of MD striped disks, a bunch of SCSI
>    changes for machines with the IBM MCA bus, bug fixes, and
>    documentation updates. Thus far, reported problems are few, though
>    there are evidently some build problems with the MCA SCSI stuff.
>    
>    Alan Cox states that TCP is "somewhat broken" in the 2.1.8x series,
>    "and will remain so until it's fixed." As always with development
>    kernels, be careful out there. Patches continue to roll in towards a
>    (still somewhat distant) 2.2 release.
>    
>    A stated goal, once development starts on 2.3, is reworking and
>    cleaning up the sound driver code. Some of you may have noticed that
>    it can be a bit, um, difficult to configure and make work right. It's
>    not clear how that development will proceed, but Colin Plumb posted a
>    good, concise article on some of the issues involved.
>    
>    Richard Gooch continues to update his enhancements. The MTRR patch
>    (MTRR stands for Memory Type Range Registers - now we all understand,
>    right?), which greatly speeds frame buffer access, is up to rev 1.8
>    (against kernel 2.1.84). His "devfs" patch (runtime creation of the
>    /dev tree) is up to version 18. Both are available from his patch
>    page. Still no word on when (or if) these patches will go into the
>    2.1 kernel.
>    
>    Unless you have a multiprocessor machine, be sure not to compile your
>    kernels with SMP enabled. Recent development kernels seem to be even
>    less than usually forgiving in this regard; SMP kernels on a
>    uniprocessor machine can die in weird and unpleasant ways.
>    Unfortunately, SMP is still the default, and is not a configuration
>    option; you need to edit the Makefile and comment out the SMP = 1 line
>    near the beginning. Believe me (voice of experience here) it's an easy
>    thing to forget...
>    
>    Also in the SMP arena is a flurry of activity around IO-APIC use. The
>    IO-APIC is an interrupt controller on multiprocessor systems which is
>    able to route interrupts to any CPU, thus helping to create a true
>    symmetric multiprocessing system. However, each motherboard seems to
>    do it a little different, leading to one of those bits of hardware
>    obnoxiousness that takes a long time to sort out. The 2.1.85 kernel
>    added a document describing IO-APIC for those interested in the
>    details.
>    
>    Is the Linux Maintenance Project dead? The question was raised this
>    week, since the web pages have not been updated in recent times. The
>    answer is that the maintainer is busy, and some new ways of running
>    the web pages are being worked out. Expect some activity there in the
>    not-too-distant future.
>    
>    William Stearns is working on a program to automate the process of
>    building a new kernel. Check out his web page for more info. Since
>    we're a weekly publication, chances are we'll be behind a rev or two
>    on the kernel release by the time you read this page. Up-to-the-second

>    Red Hat 5.0 users have also been griping a bit about how the errata
