Sir,

I can understand your emotional reaction to some of my wording, it is its
specific intent to ellicit such a reaction. It's a measure of the readers
maturity to be able to ignore the noise and focus on the issues. However,
in this particular case this seems to be working in the negative respecting
my goals. So, in order to open channels of dicussion I would like to make an
offer. I will desist on the use of these psychological warfare techniques
and their destabalizing effects on your emotional state *if* you will
return to an open discussion without resort to ad hominim and straw man
arguments and address the issues directly and in plain language without
resort to legalistic verbal camouflage to skirt the main points.

Thank you for your time in considering this offer.

Sincerely,
