If a Privacy Card is legal, and can be issued by Visa, Mastercard, American
Express, Discover, or some new issuer, and if merchants sign on (as would
presumably be the case by default with Visa and so on), then what is the
"social pressure" you speak of?

Corporate cards are already widely accepted...most of you probably have a
card issued to you through your employing institution. I see no "social
pressure" to block usage of my Institute of Applied Ontology corporate AmEx
card.

The real roadblock is that government makes such privacy-protecting
measures either difficult or illegal.
