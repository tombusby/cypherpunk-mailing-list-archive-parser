I believe Dave Wagner broke this, and posted his attack to
cypherpunks, a few months ago; if I recall correctly, his
attack reduced the final security of this to that of a
little more than one DES operation.  (The attack worked when
n=1.)  This reenforces what we already knew:  When you chain
multiple encryption algorithms, you can prove that your
result is no *weaker* than any one of those algorithms, but
that doesn't mean it's any *stronger* than the strongest of
them.
