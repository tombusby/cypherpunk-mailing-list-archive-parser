             CQRE [Secure] Exhibition & Congress
             --------------------------------------------------------
         Nov. 30 - Dec. 2, 1999, Duesseldorf, Germany


CQRE [Secure] Exhibition & Congress provides a new international
forum giving a close-up view on information security in the context
of rapidly evolving economic processes. The unprecedented reliance
on computer technology has transformed the previous technical
side-issue "information security" to a management problem requiring
decisions of strategic importance. Hence, the targeted audience
represents decision makers from government, industry, commercial,
and academic communities.

If you are concerned with solutions relating to the protection of
your country´s information infrastructure or a commercial
enterprise, consider submitting a paper to the CQRE [Secure]
Exhibition & Congress.

economic processes will also be welcome. Authors are invited to
