If any of you are interested in what's going on in nanotechnology these
days......

www.nanothinc.com

They're trying to be an all-encompassing resource on nanotechnology. Although
this industry is in its infancy, there's some really interesting things going
on. 

Regarding the site itself: It helps to have a high speed modem as there are
alot of graphics. They also play with a bit of shockwave so it would help to
have that plug-in as well.
