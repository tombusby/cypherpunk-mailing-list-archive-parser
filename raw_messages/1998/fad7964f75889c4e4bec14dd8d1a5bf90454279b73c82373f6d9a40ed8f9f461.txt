I was with a friend in Cafe Flore the other night and I had to ask the
counterperson what was playing on the stereo. Sort of techno but with
vocals on some tracks, minorish key, really great.  Anyway, the CD arrived
and track 10 is called "PGP". And yes, they're talking about *that* PGP.
My God, an ode to data privacy. This computer thing is getting out of
hand. :)
