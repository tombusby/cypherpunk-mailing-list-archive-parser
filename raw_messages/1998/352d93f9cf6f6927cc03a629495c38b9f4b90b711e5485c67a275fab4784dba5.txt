#   I'm bored with the usual run-of-the-mill jobs and am looking for a
#   challenge.  I want to solve problems, find solutions, and create
#   things with computers.
#   
#   My background is in programming/computer security and I have a
#   strong creative talent.
#   
#   My dream is to work in the R&D environment where I can be given
#   a problem/idea and turned loose.

#   I have just moved to Columbus from San Diego where this type of thing
