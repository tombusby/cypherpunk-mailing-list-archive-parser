 On the surface there would appear to be some parallels worth thinking
upon with regard to ham/FCC. but the ham radio community for the most
part qualifies under the category of 'sheeple'. Separate out the
hotheads and idiots and you have a handful of forward thinkers who
want to try to push the envelope held back by the vast majority of
reactionaries. Even when the forward thinkers want to push the
envelope within the rules, not even asking for relaxed or waived
rules, they react with 'this is not the way we have always done it.'
The FCC and the Washington establishment is well aware of this and
that is why they more or less leave hams alone to regulate their own
quiet little tea party.

 I cannot see the FCC looking kindly on the use by hams or
establishment of a Citizen's Radio Data Service (as has been proposed
several times through the years) to establish a secured delibrately
obscured data network. As far as hams are concerned they are limited,
right off the bat, by regulations prohibiting use of 'codes or
encipherment whose purpose is to obscure the meaning of the
message(data).' The ham self-regulation may be a precedent, but I
don't think it would provide any leverage on this matter. Of course,
there is always steganograpy ... one man's GIF is another mans data.
