>      LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- A man arrested on charges of possessing
>      what is believed to be the deadly toxin anthrax predicted on a radio
>      talk show the day before his arrest that the United States would be
>      the target of a major biological attack within two years.
>      
>      Tuesday, Larry Wayne Harris, speaking on Talk America Radio
>      Network's "The Buck Stops Here," gave a detailed description of what
>      he said was a plot involving more than 200 "sleeper cells" of Iraqi
>      students poised to unleash anthrax and bubonic plague bacteria on
>      the American people.
>      
>      "The odds of us making it through even the end of this century
>      without a major biological incident are very low," Harris said.
>      
>      Harris, 46, and William Leavitt Jr., 47, were arrested Wednesday
>      night in a Las Vegas suburb after an informant called the FBI to
>      report the two men told him they had anthrax. They are being held at
>      the Clark County Detention Center.
>      
>      Laboratory test results to determine whether a substance seized was
>      in fact anthrax were delayed Friday. No reason was given.

>      Leavitt's attorney, Lamond Mills, said in an interview with CNN in
>      Las Vegas he believes the tests will prove negative.

>      "On Monday, I think the test results will be in and show that it's
>      non-toxic, and they're going to have to stand up and acknowledge
>      that. And their case is going to be flushed," Mills said.
