DATA FELLOWS AND SONERA JOIN FORCES TO CREATE SECURE VPN SERVICES FOR THE
NEXT MILLENIUM

Espoo, Finland, December 1, 1998 -- Data Fellows, the leading global
security solutions vendor, and Sonera, the leading Finnish
telecommunications service provider, have announced a partnership to create
next-generation Intranet and extranet services.

The scope of the partnership is to develop a secure IP service platform by
combining Sonera's leading-edge telecommunications services with Data
Fellows' award-winning secure VPN and anti-virus products.

"Security is not a simple issue. We see leading telecommunications service
providers in a key position to help corporate customers reap the benefits
of the Internet without the inherent risks," says Risto Siilasmaa, CEO of
Data Fellows. "Over the years, Sonera has always paved the way with
innovative telecommunications services. Well-managed strong security is the
logical next step."

"Our key challenges are the increasing demand for mobility and the
increasing use of extranets between companies," says Jukka T Leinonen,
Managing Director of Sonera Solutions. "Managed IP-based virtual private
networks with a functioning Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and strong
security constitute the foundation for future corporate information
systems. Data Fellows can provide us with standards-based, proven security
with globally available strong encryption." The first products and services
will be announced early next year.  
  
Data Fellows' groundbreaking F-Secure products provide a unique combination
of globally available strong encryption, revolutionary anti-virus software
and policy based management. Data Fellows products are relied on by the
world's largest industrial corporations, best-known telecommunications
companies and major airlines, several European governments, post offices
and defence forces as well as several of the world's largest banks. Data
Fellows was selected one of the Top 100 Technology companies in the world
by Red Herring magazine in September 1998.

Sonera Ltd is Finland's leading telecommunications company, with
subsidiaries and associated companies in 14 countries. Internationally,
Sonera is a forerunner in the rapidly growing field of mobile, data, and
media communications. In 1997, Sonera's net sales amounted to FIM 8
billion, and operating profit was FIM 1.7 billion. The Group employs 8,200
people.
