The antispam assholes suddenly blocked domain ix.netcom.com.

(an amazing thing to do, all in all, and shows how far away from reality
can people be carried out by religion)

It turned out that sendmail at our mail relay site was ckecking 
their "blackhole DNS database".

I deleted all the rules that refer to them and now things seem to be OK.

I am sorry for your troubles, Bill.  Thanks for letting me know.
