ID once meant name, address and telephone number, now a name, tel
num and e-mail is okay (along with "Advt").  The NYT claims it owes this 
to its readers to show who's not who.

The "ads" are called "reader notices" by the NYT, which calls to verify
the bona fides of the purchaser. And they will not publish everything
requested (no vitriol, darn it). There's vetting but mawky pleas swing
the censor, indeed, the vetter seems to boost haywire to keep the 
mad buying. Is that not a Brit legacy, too?

Here's the poop for arrangements (as of 1/96):
