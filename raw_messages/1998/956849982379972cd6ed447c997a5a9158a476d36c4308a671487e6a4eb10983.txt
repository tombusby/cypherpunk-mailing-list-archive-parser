Subject: CIA changes Web FAQ: concedes spying on Americans

Last month, the CIA had to change its Web FAQ page because of my case,
Tsang v. CIA, which was settled when the CIA promised not to spy on me
again.  But it refused to make the same promise to cover other Americans.
The original FAQ page had said "No" to a question whether or not it spies
on Americans.  Now it concedes it spies on Americans.  The new CIA FAQ is
at:
	http://www.odci.gov/cia/public_affairs/faq.html

See my account in Sunday's (Jan. 18) Los Angeles Times Opinion page:
A CIA Target at Home in America.  It can be found at:
