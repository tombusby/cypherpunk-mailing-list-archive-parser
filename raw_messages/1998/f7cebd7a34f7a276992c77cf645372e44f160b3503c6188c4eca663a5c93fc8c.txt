$50 PER SIGNUP - NO KIDDING!
PAID WEEKLY IF YOU WISH!

This banner program should be at the top of
your links page for a couple of real important
reasons that will make perfect sense!

1.  It doesn't compete with your site - or anyone's!
2.  It pays $50 for your signups, and $10 for each one
     that anyone you refer signs up!
3.  It gives them something they need right now!

Publicize the program to other webmasters
and make $10 override on all their signups!

We will send your payments weekly anywhere
in the world . . . and the payments are guaranteed!

First, write down your referral code 000034
(that's 4 zeros and 34)

Thanks for your time!

Be one of the first on this new program --
make your own $$$ and all the overrides!
