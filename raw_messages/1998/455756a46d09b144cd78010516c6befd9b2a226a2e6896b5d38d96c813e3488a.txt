>Jetico <www.jetico.com> a Finnish company (I believe) offers a number of
encryption algorithms in its BestCrypt package, among which is GOST which
it reports having a 256 key (it also sports Blowfish and DES as I recall).
I also remember a few weeks ago reports in the press and on the List of a
porn ring broken up and some agent involved saying that the some porn was
encrypted in an old KGB program which sounded much like GOST.  The
implication is that it's transparent to the feds.  However I have no idea
about various levels at which it might be implimented.  I'm sure the real
experts on the List will fill you in.
