I want to let all my friends know about this scam going around.  It does
not matter who your local or long distance carrier is, this can cost you
a
lot of money.  Please read and if you get a call like this, report it to
the police and the FCC.  If you have a caller ID, get the number too.

High Priority **

On Saturday,  24 January 1998, Naval Air Station, Joint Reserve Base,
New Orleans' Quarterdeck received a telephone call from an individual
identifying himself as an AT&T Service Technician that was running a
test on our telephone lines.  He stated that to complete the test the
QMOW should touch nine (9), zero (0), pound sign (#) and hang up.
Luckily, the QMOW was suspicious and refused.  Upon contacting the
telephone company we were informed that by pushing 90# you end up giving
the individual that called you access to your telephone line and
allows them to place a long distance telephone call, with the charge
appearing on your telephone call.  We were further informed that this
scam
has
been originating from many of the local jails/prisons.  Please "pass the
word".
