Our mailing list is devoted to the intelligent people who are fighting fo
our freedom using crypto.  although you may fall into the category of
enjoying crypto you are obviously stupid and therefore not what this list is
aimed at.  An intelligent person would ot have sent a message to all the
people on the list asking a dumb question.  There are also a number of
hackers on our list and annoying them means flames galore (possibly)  My
advice is to get an aol account where you will be welcomed
