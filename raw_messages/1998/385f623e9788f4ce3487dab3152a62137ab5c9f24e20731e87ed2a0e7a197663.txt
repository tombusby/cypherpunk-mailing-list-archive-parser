A distributed decentralized terrorist group can trash almost any country's
infrastructure as well.  The gov't knows this, but if it were to start
happening (or their intelligence indicated it might) guards would be 
sent to the power stations, transformers, water works, radio relays, 
NAPs, refineries, etc.  

These guards would be physical, guarding physical resources against 
physical threats.  They would be able to resist smaller threats.
As you say, if outnumbered, they're eventually hosed.

The recent gov't interest in 'cyber' threats against infrastructure
reflects the fact that the government doesn't dominate the digital domain,
and can't protect it with troops, and needs it to run civilization and its
armies.
