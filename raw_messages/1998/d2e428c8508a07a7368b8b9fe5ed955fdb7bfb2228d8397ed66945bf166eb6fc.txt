  Penalty for Private use $300.

My guess is about 4-7 page.  

Paper clip at lower right side.

If last letter from Mitchell is any indication of rational
behavior, then my guess that this will eclipse the former.

But I did not open it.  This is a weekend.  I have principles.

NO envelope was received from court in response to

I will fax contents of U.S. Department of Justice envelope

We must ALL keep a good sense of humor.

A mathematician, physicist, and engineer we all asked to calculate
the volume of a red rubber ball.

The mathematician measured the diameter, then solved a triple integral
to find the volume.

The physicist submerged the red rubber ball in a vessel of water
to measure its displacement.

The engineer looked it up in his red rubber ball handbook.
