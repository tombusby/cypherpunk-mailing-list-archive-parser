(note: Due to the unexpected load on our systems - anyone who subscribed or
sent us mail between the 9th of Sept and the 12 of September should
consider doing it again - our server load peaked at approx 30 times the
normal daily load - so our mailbox filled. We now have expanded our mailbox
to 5M - hopefully this will be enough)

Call for Papers

The Insider - December 1998 edition

The Insider (http://www.ticm.com/info/insider/index.html) has been in
publication since November 1997. Since then it has gone trough a number of
changes - all for the better :}. The latest change is to move from a
newletter containing just the musing of its editor to a "learned journal".
Yes, the papers will be refereed and the editorial board has some weight in
the IT security world.

Our editorial committee now includes: Andy Smith, Dr John Tongren and Dr
Joseph Williams


On that note this is the second Call for papers.

We are looking for papers on Information Technology Security and fitting
within the following broad areas: Audit, Design and Maintenance of IT
Security.

The Papers can be from 1000 to 2500 words. We may accept papers of down to
600 words or up to 5000 words but they will have to be of the utmost quality.
