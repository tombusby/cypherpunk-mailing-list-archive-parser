No more excuses...with Contact-Pro for Windows organizing your business, club or church contacts is quick, easy and effective...and, for a limited time only, it's FREE!

If you're at all like me, you've made the same resolution year after year:  This year I am going to organize my contact information so that I can...serve my clients better...save an enormous amount of time...make more money faster...etc.

But, like me (until I found Contact-Pro), year after year resolve failed in the face of complex, expensive, ineffective, time-
wasting software that either didn't do the job, was too costly to be realistic or was powerful but impossible to learn to use.

But, then, a friend introduced me to Contact-Pro and I finally got my business contacts organized quickly and almost instantaneously.  Now I keep track of all my addresses, phone numbers, relationship histories, and all my communications in one integrated, easy-to-use application.  I even use the merge mail and merge fax capability to send customized messages to prospects and customers. My business has never been better. Now, I'd like you to try Contact-Pro for your contact management needs.

It's probably the best contact manager money can buy. PC Magazine said it's "... so powerful it could run your business..." but they also said that "... its greatest strength is the ease with which you can manipulate data."

Contact-Pro is software for everyone from the home user to business networks.  Use it to organize your business, club, church or organizational contacts or members at any level to save time, enhance your client/customer satisfaction levels and increase profits, contributions, etc.

If it's so good, why is it free?

Because the developer needs users to try the product and spread the word to others who might be interested. No tricks, just really great software and a great deal!

You get the single-user Contact-Pro license absolutely free -- not a cut-down or restricted copy -- the full product! You pay only $14.95 to cover disks or CD, printed User Guide, shipping/handling and 30 days technical support via e-mail.

Simply go to our web site
