A Leyden Jar _IS_ a capacitor, which _IS_ a mechanism to hold charge.
Capacitors don't have to come from a factory in plastic or ceramic packaging;
they're simply two (or more) conductive surfaces separated by insulation;
that insulation can be air (or probably even vacuum), though there are
much better insulators around, which commercial capacitors normally use.
				Thanks!
