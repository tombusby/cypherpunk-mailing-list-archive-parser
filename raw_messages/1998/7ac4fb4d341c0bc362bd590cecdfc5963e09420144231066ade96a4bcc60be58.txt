Not to disturb your exegetic reverie, here, Gord, but I asked Mr.
Magaziner, when he spoke at at the Electronic Payments Forum earlier this
month, in front of about 400 or so digital commerce and e$ types, the
following question:

"Given your administration's, um, success, in banning strong foriegn
cryptography, how do you propose to ban it in the United States?"

His answer then was that he was absolutely postively against key escrow or
limits on cryptography of any kind. Besides stealing all my carefully
worded thunder :-), he got a big round of applause. <grumble, grumble
goddamn liberals, grumble, grumble>

He also said that the major reason for the, um, complexity, of US crypto
policy was that the administration's internet commerce types were fighting
the law enforcent types tooth and nail about it.

I want to smash the state as much as the next crypto-anarchist :-), but I
figure this is what is happening. The spooks gave up on this crap long ago,
and it's just the cops standing in front of the steamroller now. Money
trumps crime-FUD, just like it did spook-FUD. F=MA, and all that. :-).


Cheers,
