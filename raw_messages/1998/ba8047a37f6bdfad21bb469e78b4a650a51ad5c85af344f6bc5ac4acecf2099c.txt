Sorry, I probably filtered it out.  I've had "Bruce Taylor" in my mental
bozofilter ever since he used to work for Charles Keating.  The only thing
that's changed since then is that (so far as I know) Bruce no longer
relies on pilfered S&L funds for his crusades.

Now how's that for a filtering fact?
