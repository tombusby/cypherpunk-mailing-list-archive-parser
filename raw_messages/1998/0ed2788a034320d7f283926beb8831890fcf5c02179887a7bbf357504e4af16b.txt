[Notwithstanding my preference for the latter]...

Is it the cypherpunk response to back off with our tail between our legs?
I hope not.

I smiled when I read about Toto's plans to appear in court in a perl-RSA
T-shirt. Toto has balls so big he needs a wheel barrow to get around.

And, more importantly, if crypto-anachy and removal of governments weren't
on the cypherpunk agenda. Lets not pretend that Jim and Toto (and to a lesser
degree the scrutinee J Choate) are not scapegoats for all of our opinions.

Yes. "defensible", but they weren't defended. Jim pleaded. As would anyone
in the face of sufficient pressure.

The rants are ok anyway. They are clearly metaphors. But the prosecutors
aren't playing fair. The man is "dangerous". And not because he wrote "bomb"
in crayon on a cardboard box. But because he made waves. Waves that we caught.
Waves that the straights and sheeple might catch.

Just.

I thought this might be because of his excessive use of metaphor rather
than a persecution of a medical condition unrelated to mental competence.

I took the frequency of little Timmy May's 2nd ammendment rifs as a sign
that he was clean on that score. (Tim always seems to be a couple of steps
ahead).

Illegal crypto export. That's more like it!
