There are shredders, and then there are shredders.  The SOHO-sized
shredders that just cut things into ribbons aren't very thorough
(and it's been demonstrated that documents shredded that way can
be reassembled by sufficiently large numbers of Iranian college students)
but they're good prep for burning the papers.
On the other hand, the cross-cut shredders that leave flakes no more
than 1/8" rectangles or even smaller chad are good enough for
classified documents.

Of course, if your documents are on floppy disks, any shredder that
won't jam on them does a pretty good job :-)

				Thanks!
