    statute of limitations has run. at the time, I did not
    give it much thought except the aggravation of filing the
    paperwork for what was a common business transaction. It
    was actually easier to get cash in las vegas than a cashiers
    check as the banks were so pissy.  the casinos were far 
    better than the banks once you established out of town
    credit with them --and they were 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
    week. I wanted those aircraft engines bad --the vendor in
    Chicago had the only two available for close to six months
    and he had agreed to sell them to Canada but was waiting
    on the letter of credit --the casinos wired the money direct 
    which turned the deal --the engines were on a return flight 
    the next morning --a Saturday. transferring money from a
    casino is not the best place in the world for obvious 
    reasons, despite its expediency.

    structuring transactions is certainly illegal now, but I 
    have not seen that kind of money since retiring after
    having had a run of bad luck with my health a few years 
    back (and lost my FAA medical cert).
