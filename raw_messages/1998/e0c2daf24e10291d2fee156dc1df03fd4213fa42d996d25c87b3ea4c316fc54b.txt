We've transcribed the Euro-Parliament STOA report, 
"An Appraisal of the Technologies of Political Control," 
6 January 1998, a portion of which was offered earlier
by Axel Horns and Ulf Möller.

It's a grim assessment, revealing more than most of us want to 
face about the dark side of high technology, especially what 
the most technologically advanced nations are deploying, and 
building to sell to the worst of humanity, and how export laws 
are flaunted to cut criminal deals in defiance of high-minded law 
and public policy.

It demonstrates that he national security heritage continues, 
sharing military technology with governmental outlaws around 
the globe.

And the US is leading the market.

It would be cathartic for this report was widely read, pondered,
then acted upon, in the US and globally. Kudos to the European 
Parliament for sponsoring it. And congratulations to the authors 
and the beleaguered organizations who've been trying for years
to diminish this over civilized madness, to jolt us out of 
techno-narcosis.

There's much in the report that's been discussed here, and much
more that has not but deserves to be.

The full report is 112 pages, 50 pages of main body, 13
pages of notes and 25 pages of bibliography. We've
not yet transcribed the detailed bibliography.
