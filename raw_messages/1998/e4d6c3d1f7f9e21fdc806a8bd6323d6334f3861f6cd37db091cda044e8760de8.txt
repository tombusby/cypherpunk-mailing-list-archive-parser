****Discover Alien Life With Your PC And SETI
 TOKYO, JAPAN, 1998 NOV 5 (Newsbytes) -- By Martyn Williams, Newsbytes.
The SETI@home project, which hopes to harness the idle processing power
of thousands of desktop personal computers to help in the search for
intelligent life in the universe, is back on track with an April 1999
launch date.

The project was launched in mid 1997 and was scheduled to begin
operations early this year (Newsbytes, August 18, 1997) but the launch
was delayed after funding problems slowed research and development
work. Now, with new funding and hardware donated by Sun Microsystems,
the project is back on track.

Hoping to attract the millions of computer users that believe in the
existence of intelligent life in space, the project will be based
around a special screensaver. Like any screensaver, the software kicks
in when you aren't using your PC but unlike other software, the
SETI@home application won't present you with a banal selection of
flying windows of swimming fish.

Instead, it will be doing something much more useful: analyzing radio
frequency spectrum data captured by the Arecibo radio telescope in
Puerto Rico. The analysis is searching for a signal out of all the
noise from space - a signal that may reveal the existence of
intelligent life.

The project team estimates that once 50,000 PCs are enrolled in the
project, the SETI@home program will rival other similar SETI (search
for extraterrestrial intelligence) programs that are looking for
signals from space and may turn up signals that would otherwise be
missed.

The program works like this: data is collected from SERENDIP, a SETI
project based at UC Berkeley, on magnetic tape and transferred to
SETI@home servers. This data is then distributed to participating PC
users as they log onto the Internet and the data is analyzed on their
PCs. Once finished, the results are returned to the project servers via
the Internet.

First tests of the system, with 100 volunteers, has just begun and
the project hopes to make available the first generation SETI@home
screensavers in April 1999. These will be available for Windows, Apple
and Unix based platforms.

What's in it for the user? Apart from helping science, the team says,
"There's a small but captivating possibility that your computer will
detect the faint murmur of a civilization beyond Earth."

For more information on the project, how to offer your spare computer
capacity and how to donate money, check the SETI@home Web page at

of the page are also available.
