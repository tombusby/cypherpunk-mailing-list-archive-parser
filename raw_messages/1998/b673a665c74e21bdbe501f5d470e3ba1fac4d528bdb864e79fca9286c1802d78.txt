Proven false by experiment:  Observe what happened with 
Verisign and MIME.

The cost is not signing your stuff.  The cost is setting up a 
key and publishing it, and getting other peoples keys and 
verifying them.

Integration with Eudora makes it trivial to sign and to 
decrypt, *after* you have created and uploaded a key, and 
downloaded and verified other peoples keys, which is not 
trivial.

People would rather the kindly benevolent government did that 
hard stuff for them.

Verisign/MIME is *already* integrated into everyone's
mailers, and they are not using it because Verisign key
management is too hard, and Verisign key management is
arguably more user friendly than PGP key management, though
clearly less user friendly than Crypto Kong's (lack of) key
management.
