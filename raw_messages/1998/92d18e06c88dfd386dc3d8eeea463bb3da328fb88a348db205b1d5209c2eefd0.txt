Monopolies may depend on government for long-term stability,
but fads can stick around for quite a while before dying out.
Remember Disco?  :-)

Attila also talked about Intel making badly-designed microprocessors.
It was somewhat of a vicious circle, since the big market for 80*86s
required bug-for-bug compatibility with Microsloth's "640K is enough" 
real-mode DOS, partly because of the large investment companies had in 
applications like word processors that ran in that environment.
Getting out of the problem requires replacing a whole bunch of things
at the same time, and incremental upgrades can't get you there.
(For a horrendous example, there's the Air Traffic Control system,
brought to you by the same government that wants to help us fix our
Microsoft addictions; got any spare 360/90 clones?)

Obviously, ship the spam to Microsoft and be done with it :-)
The Spam Wars does seem to be muscling out "Libertarians vs. Statists"
as the canonical all-consuming political discussion on the net,
though there's a fair bit of overlap.

Sigh.  In the business world, we tend to be stuck with Microsoft products,
chosen by the same clueless bureaucrats who choose 10-pound laptops :-)
				Thanks!
