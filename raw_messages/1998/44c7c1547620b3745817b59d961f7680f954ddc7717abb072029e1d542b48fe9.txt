	Prove it. Prove that in a competitive market certain goods and
services will be MORE expensive than in a Government-as-Supplier.

	How many Corporations you know buy $300 hammers, or $1000 toilet
seats?

	I don't begrudge a profit where it's due. Bill Clinton isn't due.
Neither is Newt Gingrinch, or any other Feeding at the government trough
pig.

	So, they don't get fired (usually) they don't get more than censured.

	No, the problem is the police. To quote (IIRC) Lydia Lunch:

	"Neo Nazis with night stick dicks, no brains but banging into yours
in the middle of the night looking for whatever don't fit in with their
ideologically unsound version of reality".

	Also known as "You wanna act like a fuck'n gang banger, I'm gonna
treat you like a fuck'n gang banger" to two teenage black males who (like
every other black male in the neighborhood) had learned to walk around the
corner when the cops drove by.

	The cops in the larger cities are so fucken dirty that a "citizens
oversight commision" will either be a politically packed joke, or wind up
changing members every couple months from attrition.

	Oh, and that has been working OH SO WELL thus far.

	No I don't. but check the numbers, there is a $6000 LESS collected
in road taxes (average) PER CAR for each car in america. That $6k comes out
of my pockets as well, and as a bicyclist I my share is MUCH less than that
of a Bronco. Not to mention that I don't pollute anywhere near as much, if
at all.

	Yeah, having to support the lifestyle habits of others really DOES
beef me. I pay *MORE* than my way, and I *WORK HARD FOR IT* (all jokes
aside). Others do NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO MY LABOR.

	That is slavery, pure and simple. No constitutional gobblygook can
change that.

	How many millions have died in the last 100 years IN wars started
by and for the advantage of the state?

	How many died at the hands of Stalin, Hitler. and other dictators?

	The state, whether here in the US, or in other countries tends to
treat the humans that comprise it with little concern for their health or
livelyhood, and the ugly truth is that the same characteristics that are
necessary to keep a government in line are the same ones that make a
government unnecessary.

	If you have citizens that are honest, principled, and willing to
assist those around them, you have no need for a "state".

	Without honesty and principles you have Slick Willy.

>Unless you kill somebody or move a few tons of coke your individual chances
>of being killed by the state is less than being struck by lightening.

	There are 1.7 million people struck by lightning every year?

	I am not going assume that our country is any better just because
it's subjects are my neighbors. No, we don't kill as many, but name one
country that has jailed more of it's subjects, and the truth is, we are
getting worse.
