Tell them the following:

"I am aware of the doctrine of jury nullification and I will inform my
 fellow jurors of it.  I will invoke it in cases where the defendant
 has been charged with a victimless crime, i.e. drug-related offenses,
 statutory rape, or other thoughtcrime, or when the law is otherwise
 unjust or unreasonable."
