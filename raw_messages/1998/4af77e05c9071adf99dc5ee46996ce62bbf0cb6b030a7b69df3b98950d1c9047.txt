You missed my point - the cost of a CPU-year and GB-year drop rapidly
every year; the costs of storage plus associated CPU for 100 years of 
storage are probably just a bit higher than for 5 years.

For normal businesses, that's true, but eternity servers, if they can
be physically located, probably will require a bit more lawyery.

You're probably right, though you may not need 7x24 sysadmins,
and they can share their time maintaining quite a lot of servers if
they're all cookie-cutter.

Somewhere between 10:1 and 100:1; the cost of sysadmins making tapes
may be higher than the media itself :-)

The price of pipes is very roughly proportional to their size.
The size of the pipes you need are roughly proportional to how much
data gets transmitted during your busy hour.  This gets cheaper
every year as well, but nowhere near as fast, and the volume
depends on how interesting the data is to potential readers
as well as on how big it is.

There are different models for how to run an Eternity server,
but any server will need bandwidth based on how much is getting retrieved.
In any case, the machine transmitting data knows which request
it's responding to, even if it doesn't really know who the
requester or the author are, so it's not unreasonable to charge
a retrieval fee or stick on an advertising banner.

You might want to give away that THC recipe for free just to end
the drug war, or to make supplies cheap and plentiful, or because
it's a bogus recipe using your own special brand of yeast.  
It's the principle of the thing :-)  On the other hand,
if the provider of the service deliberately doesn't know what
the documents on the system are, to him it's just shipping bits,
and content is Somebody Else's Problem.

I'm not talking about how to get users - I'm talking about those
annoying banners from Doubleclick and LinkExchange that fund many
of the interesting services on the net because advertisers think
it's worth their money to buy impressions.

The assumption is that True Names and physical locations are probably
anonymous.  Doesn't mean that a reader is going to retrieve documents
of unknown content by unknown authors - you may very well know that
Zed WareMeister has the best deal on slightly-used Microsoft Products
and can be found on alt.eternity.warez, and his reputation capital 
accumulates under the pseudonym rather than his True Name.
But there will also be authors whose names are well-known but whose 
locations aren't - Salmon Rushdie may be selling digitally signed copies 
of his latest book online, but he still doesn't want to be easy to find.
