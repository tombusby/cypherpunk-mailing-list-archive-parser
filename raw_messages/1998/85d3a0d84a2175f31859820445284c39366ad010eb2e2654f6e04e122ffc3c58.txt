That's true.  That's why you need to do it seven times, in order to
properly randomize the deck.

It's for exactly this reason that players at computer-dealt bridge
tournaments complain about "flat" distributions.  When they play in
"real life", people usually don't shuffle seven times, and the resulting
suit distributions end up skewed ("ghoulies" is the extreme case of this).
The players are used to this, though, and when they get actual random
hands, the distributions are much flatter.
