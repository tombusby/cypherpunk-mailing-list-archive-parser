Type-II messages don't support latency yet (or not until fairly recently,
I can't remember). Type-I remailers don't, by default, do any reordering,
but reordering is not as useful for type-I messages (unless you remix). 
Cracker uses Mixmaster to reorder type-I messages. In addition to the pool
size of 5, it also will remail a maximum of half the messages present, so
in reality, the pool size floats up and down (but not lower than 5).

The odds are somewhat worse (for the attacker). In the case of the
scenario above on cracker, the odds of any given message being cycled out
of the pool (the pool is processed at six minute intervals) is generally
50% per cycle. Thus, there is a 75% chance that it has been sent by the
end of the second cycle, and therefore a 25% (.5*.5) chance that it is
still in the queue. The current RMS latency (from the remailer's own
stats) is 19.5 minutes. You want to about double that to be sure that the
message has really come out (and then, you still can't be sure), so that's
about six cycles. If we are doing 5 per cycle, then the odds are 1 in 30. 
A very rough estimate.  However, by my estimates, it's more like 12
messages per cycle (typically; it's variable for the reasons above), so
that runs it up to 1 in 72 or so.

(And of course, the remixing ensures that all messages are
indistinquishable, whenever possible.)

Latency occurs before reordering. Latency: +00:00 does nothing, BTW, and
it's the default. Latency: +12:00r adds a 0-12 hour random delay before
reordering.

Which is probably not so hard when you record all inter-remailer traffic,
which is probably what happens somewhere.

Yep, that was part of the motivation for remixing: To keep eavesdroppers
from intercepting partially-decrypted reply blocks. It also prevents
traffic analysis based on the message section after the reply block. Reply
blocks, of course, tend to get smaller after each hop, while the message
getting delivered tends to get larger. Automatically encapsuling type-I
messages in type-II format whenever the recipient supports it prevents
this type of traffic analysis.
