What a bunch of crap!

I suggest you go over to Iraq and talk to the Kurds who were slaughtered
in CBW attacks by the Iraq military (thanks Germany) and while you are
over there ask Iraq's neighbors what they think of them getting Nukes. If
it wasn't for the Israelie attack in '81-'82 he would have had the past 15
yrs to produce weapon grade uranium and plutonium (thanks France).

Grow-up! The world is a dangerious place with dangerious people in it.
Iraq is one of those places just like Cuba was back in the '60's.
