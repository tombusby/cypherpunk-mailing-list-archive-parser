And Marijuana remains California's number one cash crop as long as it is
illegal... documented way back when by Dukmejian's (sp) agriculture
secretary, whom he fired after the report. The cops cite you, confiscate it
and smoke it, and everyone's happy because they're all making $480 per
ounce from the end consumer on this crazy gene-engineered greenbud
designed, catalogued, and bred by the University of California biology
departments (esp. Santa Cruz). If it were legal, tobacco shops would stock
joints for a tenth the price... they need new markets with the stricter
tobacco legislation; maybe there's a lobby. I watched Dennis Peron battle
it out with some meat-fisted guy from the Sherrifs' orgs in Congress. The
cop went on about how

"if we decriminalize marijuana, marijuana would no longer be illegal"

and attempted to justify its classification with crack, methamphetamines
and heroin. He and Peron were two extremes. Peron, who drove the medical
marijuana bill and is also gay, runs under the republican ticket. So, I
voted for him in the open primary to screw up their statist ics. I had fun
with that open primary.
