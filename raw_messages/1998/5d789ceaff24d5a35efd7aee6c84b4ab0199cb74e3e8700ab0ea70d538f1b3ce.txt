AN AMERICA WITH TWO LEGAL STANDARDS IS AN AMERICA WITH NO LEGAL
STANDARDS
              September 15, 1998

Mr. Speaker, if Joe Q. Citizen lied in a civil trial, he would be sued
for every penny. If Joe Q. Citizen lied to a Grand Jury, he would go to
jail. Lying is perjury. Perjury is a crime.

Now, having said that, what is going on here, Mr. Speaker? Does America
now have two legal standards, one for you, one for  me; one for he, one
for she; one for generals, one for soldiers; one for Presidents, one for
residents?

Let us tell it like it is. Joe Q. Citizen cannot apologize, Joe Q.
Citizen is not censured, Joe Q. Citizen is prosecuted. And let me warn
Congress: An America with two legal standards is an America with no
legal standards.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of the lives of all of the
soldiers that gave their lives fighting to preserve our freedom.

>
>In searching for Congressional e-mail addresses recently, I found the
>below listed web site.  For those of you who have tried to contact many
>members of Congress at once you know how time consuming the process can
>become.
>
>ElectedNet! will allow you to search for a single member by name, state,
>just one party, etc. or you can e-mail all members of Congress at once.
>It provides an effective way to quickly get your message out and uses
>your e-mail program not some "fill in the blanks" type interface.  Using
>this method you will be able to use your spell checker and retain a copy
>of the messages sent for future reference.
>
>In order to improve the impact of your message you should format your
>e-mail like a standard mail letter to congress (minus the TO: section)
>and INCLUDE your return mailing address.  Most members of Congress will
>not reply via e-mail but by U.S. Postal Service, so your return address
>is critical.  This is probably to prevent someone from changing an
>e-mail reply and forwarding without their approval.
>
>Even if you send a letter (e-mail) to a Congressional member who is not
>in your voting district, they will usually respond and track the number
>of letters for or against an issue.  With this web site it is easy to
>just "click" on another name to be included in your letter to Congress
>and the more letters some staff person has to send out the greater the
>impact your message will have during the weekly Congressional office
>staff meetings.
