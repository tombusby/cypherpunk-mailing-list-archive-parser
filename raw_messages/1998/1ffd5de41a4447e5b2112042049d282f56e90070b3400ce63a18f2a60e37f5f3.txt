Kenneth A. Minihan and George J. Tenet Elected to America Online, Inc.
Board of Directors
New Board Members Hail From NSA and CIA 

DULLES, VA /DenounceNewswire/ -- 5 November 1998 -- America Online, Inc. 
announced today Lieutenant General Kenneth A. Minihan, Director of the 
National Security Agency and Chief of the Central Security Service, and 
George J. Tenet, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, have been 
elected to its Board of Directors. AOL now boasts a board that includes 
the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell; a former 
Nixon aide General Alexander Haig; and two distingished leaders of the 
U.S. intelligence community. 

"I am proud today to announce the election of Lieutenant General Kenneth 
Minihan and George Tenet to America Online's Board of Directors. Both of 
them possess records of proven leadership and commitment to public 
service that will be invaluable to our company as we work to build our 
business and the interactive medium into the next millennium," said 
Steve Case, Chairman and CEO of America Online, Inc. 

Mr. Case added: "Lieutenant General Minihan's record of service to our 
country, both in the military and in his current work with the NSA, is 
without equal in our times. His commitment to America's security and our 
country's future fits squarely with AOL's determination to build an 
online medium that dominates people's lives -- helping us to learn, to 
organize their lives, and even to engage more fully in the political 
process." 

Mr. Case continued: "George Tenet is a visionary leader in both the 
world of intelligence-gathering and the mass marketplace. He has played 
key roles in landmark achievements for our society. His expertise in the 
world of cloak and dagger will serve AOL in meeting the critical 
challenges facing the Company and in fulfilling our commitment to build 
a medium that threatens society as no other before."

Mr. Case wasn't done yet, adding further: "We look forward to working 
with the NSA and the CIA as we migrate the AOL network over to complete 
ECHELON compatibility with the next six months." ECHELON is the 
government's secret worldwide network that monitors all voice, data, 
fax, video, satellite, and digital communications in every country, 
recording, indexing, and collating every utterance made between every 
man, woman, child, business, or other organization, as well as between 
any two computer systems anywhere. 

"The perception that the Internet can change and improve peoples' lives 
and to reconnect them to their community is powerful and extraordinary," 
said Lt. General Minihan. "I'm honored to serve on the Board of a 
company that has been leading the way in creating such a perception in 
the public's mind, and leading the way to shaping a medium that that 
will open new doors of opportunity for our national security state." 

"In the next few years, public policy discussions in Washington and 
around the world will have as much to do with the development and 
ultimate impact of the Internet as any technological advance," said Mr. 
Tenet. "I look forward to serving a Company that is at the center of 
these policy discussions and is playing a large role in determining the 
success -- or failure -- of people around the world."
