Dr. Ron Paul often introduces good bills that will never get anywhere,
because he's _not_ a mainstream Congressscritter.
He was a conservative Republican Congresscritter from Houston, 
quit the GOP in ~1986/1987, ran for President as a Libertarian, (lost),
and a couple of years ago decided to re-emerge as a Republican.

He's generally in favor of personal and economic freedom,
though he seems to believe that the US government owns the country
and therefore has the right to ban immigrants; I took the Ron Paul
bumper sticker off my car a few years after the election when he
endorsed Pat Buchanan for the Republican nomination instead of
the also-bad George Bush.  He's also rabidly against the U.N.,
and borders on Black-Helicopter paranoia on occasion :-)

He's willing to take a strong stand against the Republicrats 
when there are issues of principle, and therefore doesn't have a 
lot of support - often he and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Socialist, 
are about the only members opposing a bill.  So no surprise if the bill dies.
