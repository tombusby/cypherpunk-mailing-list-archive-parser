China _is_ currently a data haven, and the US trade talks have been
focussed on getting them to stop it.  It's not using the Internet,
just CDROMs and snailmail, but it's a huge market...

But to do that you've got to know what's on your server,
and data havens strongly depend on deniability and scalability,
so you don't sell those bits on the chips implanted in your head.
You could manage your storage in a way that lets users specify where
they _don't_ want a given opaque file to be, so they can keep
the anti-Foobarian speech out of Foobar, but if you let them
specify where they do want it, it's too easy to plant stuff.
