Who are the "digerati" and why are they "the
cyber elite"? They are the doers, thinkers, and
writers who have tremendous influence on the
emerging communication revolution. They are
not on the frontier, they are the frontier.

The digerati evangelize, connect people, adapt quickly.
They like to talk with their peers because it forces them
to go to the top of their form and explain their most
interesting new ideas. They give each other permission
to be great. That's who they want to talk to about the
things they are excited about because they want to see if
it plays. They ask each other the questions they are
asking themselves, and that's part of what makes this
cyber elite work.
