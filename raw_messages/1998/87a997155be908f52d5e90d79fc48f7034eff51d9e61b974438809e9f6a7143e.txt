Pentagon may modify websites
WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 (UPI) _ The Pentagon is reviewing its Internet
policies to determine if there is too much information on its public
access websites.

The Defense Department and the four armed services operate several
Internet websites. Internet users including newspaper reporters, high
school students working on term papers and military history buffs visit
them frequently to download photos, news releases, and other
information.

But Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said today that top
Pentagon officials have become concerned that the information contained
on those websites could be used by terrorists and others for illegal
purposes.

Bacon did not say what information officials are specifically concerned
about or what caused them to begin reviewing the content of the
department's websites. He did say, however, that no information
contained on websites to date has been put to use by terrorists.

''This is more in the area of heading off a problem rather than
reacting to one,'' he said.

No date has been set for the website review to be completed. _-
