Well... It looks as though the 17th will be a "good day to die"
if your an Iraqi...Many sources seem to be targeting the window
of Feb 17 - Feb 23 for the start of hostilities...
Wag the dawg... comes to mind of course... I wouldn't put it past
King Willie to do such a thing to deflect attention from Peckergate..
It seems to me though that the lunatic in charge of North Korea
might just find that Feb 17- 23 is also a good time to play
games in the south :(  after all... the worlds policeman will be
preoccupied and stretched mighty thin...
