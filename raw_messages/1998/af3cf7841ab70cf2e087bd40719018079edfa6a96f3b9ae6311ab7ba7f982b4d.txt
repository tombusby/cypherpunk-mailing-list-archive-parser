It seems likely that the current release candidate 

http://www.jim.com/jamesd/Kong

is going to be the actual release 1.0.

Being a good respectable law abiding American resident alien
I intend to set up two buttons, one that you click on if you
are are a US or canadian citizen, and one that you click on
if you are not.

It would be nice if the non citizen link led somewhere.
