Nope. What I am saying is the absolute magnitude of the carrier wave is
irrelevant, it's the modulation that matters and that modulation if small
and it's riding on a big carrier is hard to get at because you swamp your
front-ends because of dynamic range.

Shielding will attenuate all parts of the signal so it is a Good Thing (TM).

Gabba gabba hey hey...thought I don't run my Tesla Coil when my computers
are on, they object to the 4ft sparks.

Peltier devices are for thermal transport by binding the thermal photons
and transporting them to a different environ where they may be emitted.
Hence the original environ is cooled.

You're talking about Josephson Junctions I suspect and they're useless for
signal detection, they're a switch. SQUIDS are what are used for truly
small level signals.
