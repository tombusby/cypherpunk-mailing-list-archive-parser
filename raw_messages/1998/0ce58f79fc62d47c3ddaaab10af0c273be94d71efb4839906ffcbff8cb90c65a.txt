1.  There are lies, damn lies, and statistics. 
2.  So if the quoted material is included it's bad and if it is not
included it's bad. I think I see the general idea.  Use the rules
appropriate for complaining about whoever you want to complain about.
3.  And what I said was along the lines of most were justified, but some
showed his lack of clues.  Merely being incomprehensible to a person
means little if the person is a little clue-shy.  Badly written is a bad
thing.

And the general degradation of our society to the level that taking the
moral ground is something to be ridiculed is not a political issue?

That comment was in reference to two private (and anonymous)posts
purporting to be AOL weenies seeking such things.
