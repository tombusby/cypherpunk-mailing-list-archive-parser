But the question is one of how fast the key-search can be made, not of when
the key would be found - and I though the d.n website displayed a figure for
keys-per-second. That it takes the network not very long to find the DES key
0x0809182395f8ee isn't a very interesting piece of data; the keys-per-second
figure is more useful.
