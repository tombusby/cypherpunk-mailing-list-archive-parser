DESTRUCTION

Washington -- President Clinton November 12 extended the national
emergency regarding weapons of mass destruction that he originally
declared on November 14, 1994 with respect to the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States posed by the proliferation of nuclear,
biological, and chemical weapons ("weapons of mass destruction") and
the means of delivering such weapons.

Following is the White House text:

THE WHITE HOUSE
Office of the Press Secretary

November 12, 1999

NOTICE

CONTINUATION OF EMERGENCY REGARDING
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, I declared a national
emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States
posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical
weapons ("weapons of mass destruction") and the means of delivering
such weapons. Because the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
and the means of delivering them continues to pose an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States, the national emergency first declared on
November 14, 1994, and extended on November 14, 1995, November 12,
1996, and November 13, 1997, must continue in effect beyond November
14, 1998. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622 (d)), I am continuing the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 12938.

This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted
to the Congress.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON

THE WHITE HOUSE
November 12, 1998
