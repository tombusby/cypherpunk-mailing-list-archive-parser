We are currently needing brokers for the $9/$15 Dental Plan. If 
you or someone you know is looking for an additional income 
PLEASE LET US KNOW when you fax the above information. The Dental 
Broker program has a nice up front pay cycle and a very good 
residual for as long as the person is in the dental plan. And 
there is no license required to be a broker.

So let us know about the dental and if you know of someone 
wanting to be a broker. Tell them to contact us by faxing the 
same information.

Thank you again for your interest.
