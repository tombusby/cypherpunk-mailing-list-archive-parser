Simon Hossack has sent us a copy of a letter to Oliver Heald 
MP (UK) from the House of Commons Library on US signals 
intelligence in Europe, with focus on Menwith Hill. It is an answer 
to Mr. Heald's request for information on the charge of US 
spying in the STOA report as described by Duncan Campbell 
and Nicky Hager.

The letter documents successive parlimentary and journalistic 
inquiries about the USA/UK 50-years-long arrangement for joint 
intelligence and HMG's answers.
