>  Yesterday I got an email from Jeff Veen at Wired pointing me to the
>  server that Netscape is running its What's Related? application on.
>  This server is part of the project they did with Alexa Internet, and
>  it's the back-end for the What's Related? feature in Netscape 4.5.
>
>  I had a little time to kill, was looking for a diversion, so I sent a
>  message to Netscape's server via script and I was blown away. It's
>  XML! Yes it is. And why, oh why, didn't they tell anyone? (Or did I miss
>  something?)
>
>  Anyway, I wrote an app that talks to their server. It interfaces thru
>  an HTML form. You enter the URL of a site, and I find out what's related,
>  with a twist. The URL to the related site links back to the form, and I do
>  a lookup on *that* site, allowing you to interactively walk their
>  tree of relationships.
>
>  This is just a demonstration. I want to be sure that people interested
>  in building XML apps have a way to experience the XMLness of what
>  Netscape has done, which is very interesting, for sure.

>  doing? Building cool servers and editors, of course!
