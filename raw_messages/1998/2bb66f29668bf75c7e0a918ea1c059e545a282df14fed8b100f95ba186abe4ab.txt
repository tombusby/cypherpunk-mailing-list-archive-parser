                           Scoop the Grim Reaper!
                                      
                               Who will live?
                                      
                               Who will die?
                                      
        And who will win the grand prize in Dewey's Death Pool -- an
   all-expense paid, two-day Hollywood Death Tour for two. Or one of four
          quarterly prizes -- a fabulous celebrity death library.
                                      
     It's fun, it's easy -- and all you have to do to win is correctly
     forecast more celebrity deaths for the calendar year 1998 than any
                               other entrant.
                                      
    Here's how it works: Between now and December 31, 1997, fill out an
   entry form, listing your picks in descending likelihood of death. For
     instance, if you believe Celebrity X is a cinch to die within the
   year, list him or her in the No. 1 slot, followed by your second most
     likely choice in the No. 2 slot, etc. For tie-breaking reasons, a
   correct pick in the top slot is worth 10 points, a correct pick in the
    second is worth 9 points, and so forth. (Please list an alternative
      name in the event that one of your choices dies before the game
   begins. The alternative will be substituted in the empty slot and you
              will not receive credit for the original name.)
                                      
     At the end of the year, the contestant with the most correct picks
   wins. If there's a tie, the winner will be the person with the highest
     point total. In the event of a point-tie, the contestant with the
          youngest decedent will win. Judges' decisions are final.
                                      
     In addition, quarterly prizes (an assortment of guide books, maps,
   videos and other celebrity death memoribilia) will be awarded for the
   most correct picks within the four three-month intervals ending 11:59
    EST on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 1998. In the
   event of ties, tie-breaker rules described above apply. Standings will
                     be updated on the site regularly.
                                      
   To qualify as a correct "hit," a death must be noted in one or more of
   the following publications: New York Times, Los Angeles Times, U.S.A.
                      Today, Time, Newsweek or People.
                                      
     Paid obituaries do not count; the death notice MUST appear in the
      context of a news story, roundup item or editorial obituary. If
   someone's death is not mentioned in one of the above publications, you
                          will not receive credit.
                                      
    You will not receive credit for a death if you somehow contribute to
   that person's demise. If there's any dispute over the exact date of a
    celebrity's demise, information listed on the death certificate will
                                  prevail.
                                      
    Dewey's Death Pool is open to residents of the 50 United States and
      the District of Columbia who are 18 years or older. For complete
                       rules, see the Official Rules.
