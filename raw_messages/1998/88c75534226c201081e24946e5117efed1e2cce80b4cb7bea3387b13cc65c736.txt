Of course not --if these services were provided in a free market.  The
problem is, they're currently provided by a monopoly which is willing to
initiate force (or threaten to do so)  against any competitors.  Look at
what happened to poor old Lysander Spooner when he started competing
with the mail carriers back in the 19th century.

This much must be obvious, even to you --after all, we've been telling
you this, in different ways, *over* and *over* again.

You again make the argument that everything'd be fine if it weren't for
those nasty people who are abusing their offices.  Surely you remember
the flaw in that argument.  If you don't, read my last post.

Gee Jim, you're just as bad as those other statist pricks who like to
reinterpret a word's meaning after it's been changed by decades of
propaganda.

For instance, I very much doubt that "welfare" and "forced charity" were
synonymous, back in the late 18th century.

You still haven't given any solid arguments as to why this is the case. 
You still ignore what we've been telling you and persist in believeing
that all anarcho-capitalists are socially irresponsible at heart.  (Even
when the only apparent difference between me and you is that I'm not
willing to point a gun at another person, or have it pointed for me, to
make him perform his "social responsibility" to give me his property for
one reason or another.)

Really?  The parallels we've seen recently have been striking.

You were correct right up until the open-parens.

Oh no, they haven't started doing that *yet* (as far as I know,
anyway).  They're steadily moving in that direction, however.

What's wrong with moving a few tons of coke?  Who is harmed by coke who
does not wish to be?

That would explain your responses.  You read them so fast that all you
see are little hooks for you to tack on your pre-recorded statist rants
to, while your mind skims smoothly over those arguments which don't
conform to your preconcieved notions.
