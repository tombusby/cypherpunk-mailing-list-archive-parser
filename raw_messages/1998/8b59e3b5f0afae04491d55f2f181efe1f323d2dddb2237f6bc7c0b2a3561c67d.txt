Ok. Let's use the example of fire stations and insurance companies that came
up earlier.

What do you suppose the impact on the bottem line will be by increasing the
amount of non-income-producing-services that such a situation would require?
Each insurance company would be responsible for many, many stations
scattered all over the country. This means some sort of centralized
mechanism to create policies and other procedures and their requisite costs.
Now, consider what that means to the payment each policy holder is going to
have to deal with. It's going to be large because it's going to have to take
up for parts of the company that don't bring in policy income but still
require service coverage.

Now by distributing this system out and assigning it to governments and
providing equitable service to all, no questions asked they're there we, we
get a system that is reasonable in cost and provides good responce.

And we don't have to pay the insurance company a bunch of money to do a job
they don't want to do (otherwise they'd be in the fire fighting business and
not the insurance business).

Lot's of them throw good money after bad. All businesses do. It's human
nature. I know of one company that got so carried away with spending for
little dribbles and drips that they ended up having to stop hiring new
employees that the company desperately needs. I used to work for one,
Compu-Add, that led to its final demise.

Agreed. But the solution is term limits on Congress-critters and a
re-vamping of some critical laws.

Well I happen to come from that sub-culture so I can speak from experience.
The majority of times I or my friends were hassled we were asking for it.

Knowing Lydia's reputation I'd suspect she'd agree.

If anything interesting happens here in Austin with the new over-sight group
I'll send a pointer.

No, and that's my point.

How the hell do you figure that one? It may come out of YOUR state taxes but
it certainly doesn't come out of mine (I don't have state taxes). The funds
for road and such is collected solely through gasoline and auto related
sales taxes in Texas.

Perhaps you should fix your state government...

Now if you're talking about the federal taxes for roads, that has NOTHING to
do with your or my driving vehicles on those roads. It has to do with a
program implimented in the early 20th century to create a good road net in
the US for military use. The taxes are justified in principle, if not in
amount, through commen defense.

Interpeted?

  
We, the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, 
establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common 
defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to 
ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the 
United States of America.

Most of the wars of this century were started either by people acting in
concert willingly (eg Nazi Germany) or pure accident (eg Prince Ferdinand
has already lived through one assissination attempt, a reasonable man would
have gone home).

> 	How many died at the hands of Stalin, Hitler. and other dictators?

A lot more than at the hand of honest people, which is my point as well.
These were people, not governments. The citizens willingness to participate
aided and abetted each and every one of them and weakens your use of them in
your defence.

Yep, I see lots of that every day. In one hand you complain about welfare
and then in the other claim that the state is uncaring. Can you please make
up your mind?

Yeah, and if frogs has wings they wouldn't bump their butt when they jumped.

If your process relies on this it's doomed from the get go. This ain't
Vulcan.

And Bubba next door as well as that face that stares out at you every

There aren't 1.7M poeple killed in the US by the LEA's. That would be about
1-in-150. There are several hundred people killed by lightening each year in
the US. The number of people killed in activity complicent with LEA's is
probably not a great deal (at most an order of magnitude) over that.

Agreed, one of the reasons I support this mailing list and my local
activities.
