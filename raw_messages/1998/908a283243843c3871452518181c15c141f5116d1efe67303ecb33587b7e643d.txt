We offer three of the US complaints in the embassy
bombings:

   http://jya.com/usa-v-qaeda.htm

These describe charges against Wadih el Hage, Mohamed 
Sadeek Odeh and Haroun Fazil, filed in New York's
Southern District.

El Hage is the American arrested last week that Guy 
referred to with the "This is a listed crime?" thread.

NYT reports on El Hage and Fazil:

   http://jya.com/fazil-el-hage.htm

Odeh is the first suspect arrested at the Pakistani 
border.

Fazil is an explosives expert charged with making the Nairobi 
bomb and directing the op. He is a fugitive with a $2m reward 
offered.

All are allegedly members of Qaeda, Bin Laden's "international
terrorist" group aiming to kill Yanks worldwide for Echelon-type
stuff.

Know who's with Jim and CJ at Springfield? Blind Sheik Omar
of World Trade Center bombing fame and Mafioso John Gotti, 
who nearly croaked from lack of dental care at another pen.

The place has a distinguished history. See its honor roll on
Alta Vista. Search "Medical Facility for Federal Prisoners."
