I haven't _seen_ Lance Cottrell's NSA ID badge, but many of the hard-core 
cypherpunks have them - it's amazing how official things look when they're 
laminated in plastic!  Even the one with Hugh Daniel in a tie... 

Anonymizers don't do very well for extortion yet.
Sending the anonymous message is the easy part - paper mail is much
better at anonymity, since there's much more of it, and the default
collection methods in most countries are anonymous.

Then you've got to get the targets to READ email - some do, some don't.
Email to most politicians is like paper mail to most of them - 
gets sorted by the pound, and if there's money attached you'll
get a thank-you note.

It's collecting the ransom money that's hard - without Digicash,
there's no good anonymous payment mechanism.

I usually post anonymous postings from the Netherlands, myself.
It simplifies jurisdictional questions.
				Thanks!
