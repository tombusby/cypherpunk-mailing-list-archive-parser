This has been mentioned before. Only suggested response so far is to fight
tooth and nail to ensure that hub-dependent programs can work transparently
with a software fill-in. Otherwise you could potentially need to break a
tamper-resistant chip, patch the software (fortify^2...), or pull off some such
superhuman feat.

(By the way, the address for letters to the editors of Mobile Computing and
Communications, in case you want to respond to the articles mentioned, is

More redundant reiterations of senseless nonsense:

I'm not so confident it'd be backdoored, but if it's closed-source (not
unlikely) that is, for obvious reasons, bad. Even if not, it will, with
probability just barely <1, result in Intel as a major CA. I don't think the
hub'd be backdoored because it'd be a risky investment for anybody to backdoor
it; although I'm not sure the hub'd be closed-source, anything trivially and
undetectably compromised is about as bad; Intel'd use the hub to become a CA
just because it makes business sense.
