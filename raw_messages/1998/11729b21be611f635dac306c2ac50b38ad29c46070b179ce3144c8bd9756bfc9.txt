ARE YOU BEING INVESTIGATED ?



Learn the Internet tools that are used to investigate you, your 

friends, neighbors, enemies, Employees or anyone else!  My 

huge report "SNOOPING THE INTERNET" of Internet sites 

will give you...


* Thousands of Internet locations to look up people, credit, 

Social security, current or past employment, Driving records, 

medical information, addresses, phone numbers, Maps to city 

locations...



Every day the media (television, radio, and newspapers) are 

full of stories about PERSONAL INFORMATION being used, 

traded, and sold over the Internet... usually without your 

permission or knowledge. 


With my report I show you HOW IT'S DONE!!!
	

It's amazing..

	

Locate a debtor that is hiding, or get help in finding hidden 

assets.



*   Find that old romantic interest.


*   Find e-mail, telephone or address information on just about 

     anyone! Unlisted phone numbers can often be found 

     through some of these sites!!



Perhaps you're working on a family "tree" or history. The 

Internet turns what once was years of work into hours of 

DISCOVERY & INFORMATION.




      Check birth, death, adoption or social security records.


MILITARY

      Check service records of Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine 

      Corps. Find out who's been telling the truth and who's been 

      lying. Perhaps you can uncover the next lying politician!!!
 


FELLOW EMPLOYEES;


* Find out if your fellow employee was jailed on sex charges, 

or has other "skeletons" in the closet!!

   educational claims, Find out Military history and discipline, 

   previous political affiliations, etc.

WHAT'S THE LAW? STOP GUESSING!!


* Look up laws, direct from law libraries around the world. Is 

  that new business plan legal?? 


NEW JOB?  NEW TOWN?  NEW LIFE?


   Employment ads from around the world can be found on the 

   Internet. Get a new job and disappear!



The Internet can tell you just about ANYTHING, if you know
