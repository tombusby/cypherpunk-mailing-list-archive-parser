NYA and John Young

I bought three books for you guys at B Dalton at the Cottonwood
mall in Rio Rancho last night.

One is titled

	LOS ALAMOS
	and the development of the 
	ATOMIC BOMB

	by Robert W. Seidel

The book covers von Nuemann, Feynman, Ulam, and Metropolis.

These guys pioneered use of Monte Carlo techniques in nuclear bomb
design.

My former MS and  Ph.D. student Ted Lewis 

http://www.friction-free-economy.com    

told me some years ago that the GFSR 

http://www-hto.usc.edu/software/seqaln/doc/html/gfsr.3.html          

is used the nuclear bomb simulations.

We were into Monte Carlo work in the '70s

But in the '80s I WAS FORCED into the business of electronic locks, data
authentication
and fuzing weapons.

Let's ALL hope for settlement.  So that we CAN ALL move on to better
projects.

Later
