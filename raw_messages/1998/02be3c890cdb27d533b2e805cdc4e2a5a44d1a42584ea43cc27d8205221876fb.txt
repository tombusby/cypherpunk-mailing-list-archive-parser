Actually not.  There are quite a few business that have employees as
shareholders.  Most shares of companies are reasonably priced and
easy enough to get a hold of.  Selling them on the other hand is
not so straightforward.

Sounds Marxist to me.  Your percentage of equity in anything is
proportional to the risk level you take.  The employee risks none
of their own capital so cannot legitimately expect to be rewarded
with stock.  The employee is free to leave at any time and thus
discontinue their only investment in the company, their day to day
presense.

Of course that does not preclude the employer from offering stock
as an incentive to long term commitment or as an enticement to stay
when the market takes a downturn etc.  In that case the employee
is then taking a risk -- basically the opportunity cost of moving
to a more lucrative situation (one of which is working for himself
and becoming an "evil robber baron").

Hmmmm.  That would work like a charm when it comes to paying dividends.

What the business does it hire them so they don't have to risk their
own capital.  Of course the labor/socialist view is that they are
being exploited.  I encourage all workers who think the "from each
according to their abilities to each according to their needs" model
works well to emigrate to Russia.  As PJ O'Rourke says, "there they
boil stones for soup".  Go to China and see what kind of "profit
sharing" deal they will make you.  Better yet, try to become a 
prosperous self-employed person.

Ask Marx.  Apparently you don't think capitalist models work.

More PJ O'Rourke...

"And here is another shock.  Professor Samuelson, who wrote the early
editions [of "Economics"] by himself, turns out to be almost as much of a
goof as my friends and I were in the 1960s.  'Marx was the most
influential and perceptive critic of the market economy ever,' he
says on page seven.  Influential, yes.  Marx nearly caused World War III.
But perceptive?  Samuelson continues: 'Marx was wrong about many things
... but that does not diminish his stature as an important economist.'
Well, what would?  If Marx was 'wrong about many things' *and* screwed
the baby-sitter?"
