For comic relief, see

http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/arts/groucho-fbi-file.html and

http://www.thenation.com/issue/980928/0928WIEN.HTM

regarding Hoover's investigation of a famed Marxist comic.

(BTW, Obergruppenfuehrer Freeh's characterization of Declan as a
"radical" reminded me of the mathematical quip by that obscure Marxist
comic, Karl:  "To be radical is to go to the root of the equation!")

Cigar jokes are left as an exercise for the reader.
