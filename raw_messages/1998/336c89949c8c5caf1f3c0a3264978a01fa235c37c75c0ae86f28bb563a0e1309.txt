   WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following is the statement
of Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, on Senate passage Monday night, Sept. 28, 1998, of the
Hatch-Leahy-Kyl Substitute to S.2392, which was initially introduced
by Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, at the request of the Administration.
The bill also includes a new amendment by Sen. Fred Thompson
(R-Tenn.).

   The bill now goes to the House. The bill's purpose is to encourage
the full disclosure and exchange of solutions and test results for
Year 2000 computer problems, by providing limited liability
protection, for a limited time, for specific kinds of Year 2000
information that is considered essential to remediation efforts,
but not for faulty products or services. It promotes
company-to-company information sharing, without limiting the rights
of consumers.  The bill also includes a Leahy provision chartering
a national Y2K Website for consumers, small businesses and local
governments.

   "Four-hundred and fifty-eight days from now, millions of computers
controlling our air traffic, recording credit card sales, running
electric and phone systems, tracking bank deposits and monitoring
hospital patients may crash in befuddlement.

   "No bill can magically solve the Y2K problem, but this bill
greatly increases the chances that people will come forward more
readily with solutions.

   "This bill also includes a provision I have offered that will help
consumers, small businesses and local governments by chartering a
national information clearinghouse and Website as a starting point
to provide rapid and accurate information about solving Y2K problems.

   "Knowledge is power in exterminating the millennium bug, and it
makes perfect sense to amplify and encourage the use of the Internet
itself as an information resource in grappling with this problem."
