An anti-cookie, I like it.

LISTSERV provides a cookie and makes you type "ok" in the body. Making
that "ok" or "cancel" and keeping the cookie active for a day or so
seems like it would be a really simple modification. One "cancel" of
course is over-riding and final.

Similarly for majordomo and other custom acknowledgement schemes.

Most lists and services have dealt with the problem of someone
accidentally subscribing or maliciously subscribing someone else in one
of two ways:

A) send and acknowledgement message with a randomly generated
authorization code that requires the user to respond.
B) send out a password and require the user to login before account is
activated.

This works only if you assume the malicious individual will not receive
mail sent to that address. This therefore falls down when the address is
a mailing list or other distribution point that the malicious individual
has access to directly or via archives.
