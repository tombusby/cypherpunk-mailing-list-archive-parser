Hi Mr. or Ms. support@xroads.com,

I'd like to advise you of abuse of your system and the resultant spam that I
am receiving as a result.

I've checked my subscription list and it contains NO xroads.com subscribers
at all. You are apparently having legitimite, non-commercial traffic
forwarded to your site in order to cause excessive work and potential denial
of services (to your customers).

Please police your own house before you go around threatening $500 leins and
prosecution on others.

Have a nice day.
