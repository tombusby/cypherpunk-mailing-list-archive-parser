Everybody's belief/morals are different.  For instance I take that
last paragraph of yours and laugh at it.  To many americans doing so
would not be immoral because many people don't believe in god.  Your
moral yardstick would be different from mine.  People in the bible
belt have different morals from those in las vegas.  If I had religous
right morals I'd kill myself.
