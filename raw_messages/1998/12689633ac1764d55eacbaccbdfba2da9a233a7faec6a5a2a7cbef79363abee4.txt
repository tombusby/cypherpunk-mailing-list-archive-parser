Itex Sues Over Yahoo! Postings

Friday, September 4, 1998; 12:13 p.m. EDT

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An investment firm is suing the people who posted
online messages on a Yahoo! bulletin board accusing managers of
incompetence, even though the firm has no idea whom to sue.

Itex Corp. listed 100 ``John Does'' in its lawsuit filed this week in
Multnomah County Circuit Court.

In May, somebody using the name ``Orangemuscat'' declared on the Yahoo!
online message board that Itex's ``current management is blind, stupid and
incompetent.''

The lawsuit charges the author of the message with defaming the company and
its president, undermining the confidence of Itex's investors, customers
and barter exchange members.

``Orangemuscat,'' ``Investor727,'' ``colojopa'' and other names are listed
as defendants ``presently unknown to plaintiffs but whose true identities
will be included in amendments hereto when those identities are discovered.''

Donovan Snyder, an Itex lawyer, said it was necessary to sue in order to
find the authors of the message, but he declined further comment.

Itex, a barter exchange brokerage, had engaged in a bitter takeover
struggle with a rival brokerage, and has faced questions from critics who
challenge the way it values its assets. The company previously has turned
to the courts to battle former employees and critics.

Yahoo! disclaims all responsibility for the messages that are posted on its
message boards.

``We have no way of knowing who some of the people are,'' said John Place,
Yahoo's general counsel.

Place said Yahoo's policy is to refuse to surrender any user information
unless a court orders it to do so. But even under a court order, he said
Yahoo! would have a hard time identifying users.

The case is one of many that are pushing courts to define privacy rights on
the Internet.

``I would not want to limit people's ability to post information online,''
said Lois Rosenbaum, a partner at the Portland law firm of Stoel Rives.
``But I would like to see some accountability for what they posted.''

Rosenbaum represented Beaverton-based Epitope in a 1993 case against a man
who posted critical remarks about the company on a public bulletin board on
the Prodigy online service. In that case, the comments turned out to be
from a stockbroker with an interest in driving down the price of Epitope's
shares.
