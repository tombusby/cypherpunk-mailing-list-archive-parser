Well I've used all three version. In particular after I got my current Sun
4/380 from the local CACTUS Unix user group I tried several variaties of BSD
on it and none of them have stayed up as long, had as many applications
available for them, or been easier to debug than Linux SPARC (and that is
behind x86 by a couple of generations - though that should change in the
immediate future). I also tried it on my Amiga 2000 when there wasn't a
working version of Linux for it. I've got like 5 different disk sets I've
tried over the last 3 years, thanks I'll stick with Linux SPARC. I've even
got an *old* version of BSD before they went with their current license scheme
that I used when I worked at Compu-Add from '91 through '92 in their POS
support department because one of our food chain customers liked the way
the box arched....:)

I have yet to see any BSD installation with a total uptime greater than 8-10
weeks whereas I've seen my *old* 1.1.59 Linux version (still running on
einstein.ssz.com at this very moment) stay up for over 6 months between
reboots (and even then it wasn't a requirement, the clock keeps wondering off
and by 6 months it's nearly 12 hours ahead).

I have no desire to get into a OS war, I currently use like 6 different
os'es at home - to each their own.

But to assuage your curiosity I prefer AmigaDOS and/or Plan 9 with Logo
for programming (now if I could only find a decent Logo compiler),
though Amoeba is starting to look pretty interesting. I'd use BeOS a lot
more if I thought for one second there was a real future for it, even though
I do try each release.
