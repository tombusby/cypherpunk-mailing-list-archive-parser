We are designing an extranet for our non-employees, customers, and partners
to work on program information.  All users will be authenticated by personal
digital certificates that we will issue from our Netscape Certificate
Server.

It is my understanding that users from Canada, Italy, and Norway must have a
certificate encrypted at 56 bit.  Are you aware of any other
restrictions/requirements?

The crypto law survey mentions use of Trusted 3rd parties for Italy and
Norway.  Are there commercial companies that act as Trusted 3rd parties?

look forward to hearing from you.
