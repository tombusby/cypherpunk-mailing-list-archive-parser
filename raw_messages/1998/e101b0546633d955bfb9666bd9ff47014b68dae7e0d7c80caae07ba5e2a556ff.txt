The second year of a new conference is perhaps the most difficult--the
novelty has worn off but the conference is not yet firmly established.
But all indications for FC98 are promising.  Another success next week
will be a signal to do it again next year.

A new organization, the International Financial Cryptography
Association (IFCA) has been formed to support future meetings of the
Financial Cryptography conference.  IFCA will not only be responsible
for organizational aspects of the conference, but will also select the
program chair.  All paid registrations of FC98 will automatically
receive a year's membership in IFCA (unless they indicate that they do
not wish to join).  Others may join by paying membership dues.  A
first general meeting of IFCA will be held on the evening of Tuesday
February 24, just before the conference rump session, and all members
are encouraged to attend.

The main purposes of the meeting will be to elect directors and to
discuss possible locations for FC99 (and perhaps FC00).  If you are
interested in hosting an FC conference and can provide some logistic
support for it, you are invited to bring a proposal to the meeting.
Ideas tossed around so far have mostly focused on other "financial
island" locations, e.g., Grand Cayman, Hong Kong, Manhattan, Jersey,
etc., but anyplace reasonable will be considered.  (There will almost
certainly be insufficient information available at the time of the
meeting to make a decision, but an indication of the wishes of the
membership will be gathered to help guide the directors.)
