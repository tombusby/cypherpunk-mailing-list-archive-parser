I cannot give such example because hard crypto products are not available to
the general public.

I am unaware that microshit OS has hard crypto built-in. The only hard crypto
package I have ever seen for sale at mail-order (and thus not anonymous) is
NAI's PGP (and I have never seen any hard crypto available in a store for cash
- but that can only mean that there is no perceived demand).

However, any hard crypto that would work on system level and encrypt all
communications is not available for purchase (it is available for free,
though, in the form of IPSec package with 128-bit block ciphers for
*BSD operating systems.)

There is a number of VPN companies that offer crypto boxes, but AFAIK they
either do not mention crypto scheme they use or they say DES. There is
only one VPN company that advertises 128-bit crypto in it's product.

You'll miss all the fun. After talking to 5-6 departments one concludes
that no one knows anything about 4758, but they are all nice and helpful,
and forward your call to each other. 4758 does not exist for casual callers.
My guess is that if you have been dealing with IBM for some time you may
be able to get it.

To recap, there are no hard crypto drop-in hardware products available to
general public in the USA today.

The question is how to make money by selling hard crypto in the US. NAI seems
to be the only company that can get away with so-called "publishing exception"
in the commercial world. Their joining the key recovery alliance is probably
unrelated :-)

There are many neat ideas. But no hardware.
