We have received such enthusiasm from customers and reviewers, alike-we
just had to share!  At Extensis, we never get tired of having multiple
wingdings attached to our reviews, and the quotes are even better! Judge
for yourself.


"QX-Tools 4.0 belongs among your most valuable XTensions. 
QX-VectorEdit's ability to import PostScript and PDF alone is worth the
price." - Publish, 12/98

"Some inventions are so obvious, you wonder why no one thought of them
before-enter Extensis QX-Tools 4.0. QX-Tools is an excellent collection
of XTensions and it's a good value too-even if you only use half of
them"-Computer Arts, 11/98

"QX-Tools 4.0 enables designers to transcend XPress' limitations and
work more efficiently and intuitively."-eMediaweekly, 9/98
