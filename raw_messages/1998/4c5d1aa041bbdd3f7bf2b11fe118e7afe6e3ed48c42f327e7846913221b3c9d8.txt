    in the U.S. the _best_ you will ever do is run a smokescreen

    dont use Switzerland; it has been translucent for at least 20     
    years and is fast approaching transparency.

    Lichtenstein --if you can get an introduction into Landesbank from
    a local 'truehand'   --even better, if you can get into the PrivatBank.
    just remember, if it is the former, as you enter the main circle in
    Vaduz from the south, get out and kiss the bricks.  if you can not
    get the introduction, dont count on the extra services. secondly,
    you can not own anything in Lichtenstein without a residency permit
    and good luck on that one.  as they say: no further information 
    available....
