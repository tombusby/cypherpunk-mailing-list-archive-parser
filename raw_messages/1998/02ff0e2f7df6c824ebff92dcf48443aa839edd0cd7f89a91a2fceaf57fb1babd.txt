My mistake. Since it really does only handle individual apps it's of limited
utility in the Windows world because of the numerous ways to get system
level access.

Considering that this doesn't prohibit apps from getting access to that
memory, it only prohibits that memory page from being written to disk, it
has limited utility. It's only real protection is against disk scans.

For example a bogus service could gain system level and initiate a DMA
transfer of that non-swappable ram into their own address space.

Sure it is. It's the entire reason to have big online memory pools. Idealy
you'd have a computer with nothing but gig's and gig's of ram and no hard
drive at all.

No, simply provide it enough ram it never has to swap out to disk except in
the case of updates to files. If ram's that cheap we could do away with the
drive completely.

They why do I (and you unless youre using a tty) keep adding ram to my
Win/Linux/Solaris/AIX/HP/etc. boxes to reduce the swapping that is taking
place? It's slow, we put up with it because we can't afford those hundreds
of meg's of ram to hold our app and the entire database file (for example).

No, it wouldn't. The question of swap or virtual space is one of economics
and not computer architecture. If it were economicaly feasible there would
be no drives just fast main ram.
