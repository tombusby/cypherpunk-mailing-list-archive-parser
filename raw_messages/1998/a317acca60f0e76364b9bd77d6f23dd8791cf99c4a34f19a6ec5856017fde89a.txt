Software Money
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)

        Successful political campaigns follow a simple formula: 1) Spend
   heaps of money; 2) Puzzle out how to squeeze your message into one

        Silicon Valley finally got the first part right. Software

   soon-to-be-announced project (contracts haven't been signed yet) grew
   out of the Alliance for a Secure Tomorrow, which firms hurriedly
   created last fall to battle FBI-backed legislation banning software
   such as PGP, which is capable of encoding messages so securely that
   police can't crack them. But the AST languished. Soon CEOs of more

   aggressive approach. "The only time you're going to win this battle is
   when you put money on the table," says Lauren Hall of the Software
   Publishers Association.
