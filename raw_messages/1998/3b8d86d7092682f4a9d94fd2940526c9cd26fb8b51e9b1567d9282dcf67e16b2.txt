 Company expects to acquire $50 million in assets by mid-1998</B>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  
DALLAS --<FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3><B> </B>UNFC<B> </B>), a diversified real estate investment firm formerly known as Universal Fuels Company, is quietly acquiring over $50 million in previously undervalued, undercapitalized or mismanaged commercial properties and
 making this new major player<FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3><B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>one of the best moderate-risk real estate investments in 1998.  
 
Founded in 1975 as Universal Fuels, the company provided uranium to the world as an alternative fuel, but as uranium became less used as a nuclear fuel source than other more economical and useful materials, Universal Fuels' stock declined almost to extinction over several years.  Less than a year ago the stock price was less than 1¢.
 
Four months ago officials from Camden-Townwest, a privately held real estate investment firm, approached Universal Fuels former management about converting Universal Fuels into a publicly traded real estate conglomerate.  Camden-Townwest, founded in 1994, grew from $19,000 in cash to $3 million in assets in three years without seeking any outside capital.  Since the change in management and corporate mission last October, <FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3><B> </B><A HREF="http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=UNFC&d=t">U
NFC</A><B> <FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3></B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3>has seen its stock value increase by over 800%.   
 
Remington-Hall<B>  </B>is now making its move to increase assets at a tremendous rate.  By mid-year management expects to acquire in excess of $50 Million in office buildings and multi-family properties at a significant discount to their market value. "We have been referred to as 'Cat Burglars of Real Estate'," said Douglas Fonteno, president & chief executive officer.   "And that's a title we hope to keep."
 
Larry Hood<B> <FONT  COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE=3>,</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>formerly Chief Operating Officer of Pizza Inn and Chief Financial Officer of Reliance Mortgage Company, is Remington-Hall's Chief Financial Offi
cer, giving the new company immediate and substantial financial integrity.  Wade Hyde, previously public relations and investor relations executive for Blockbuster Video and FoxMeyer Corporation, is Vice President of Marketing & Public Relations. 
 
Currently Remington-Hall<FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3><B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>is seeking to be listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq National Market.  The company anticipates announcing over $10 million in newly acquired assets by the end of January.
