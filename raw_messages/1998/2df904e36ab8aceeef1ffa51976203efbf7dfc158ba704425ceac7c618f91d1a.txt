The three new programs that are sweeping the industry.........

HURRICANE..Extremely fast.This extractor goes to major search engines (you can 
pick from a list of 10 of the most popular search engines) and conducts a search by 
keyword or keywords. It then spiders the web pages that come up as search results 
extracting the email addresses and saving them in a plain text format. You can define 
how deep the search is to be. You can filter out addresses such as those with 
webmaster or admin. You can use additional filters to have the software only include 
url's containing certain keywords. It can also eliminate  certain url's with specified 
keywords. This makes for some very tight targeting. The cost of Hurricane is $ 250  
but scroll down to see the package deal.

The demo will work showing you how fast and accurate the software is but you will 
not be able to save or use the addresses collected.

general addresses. You input a city and state and hit the start button, kick back and 
watch it collect. Quite fast. Easy to use. The cost of GEO SNAKE is $250.00
