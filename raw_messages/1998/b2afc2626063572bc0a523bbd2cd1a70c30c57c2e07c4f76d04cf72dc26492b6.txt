You can find *most* of netscum at this URL:

http://www.spambusters.dyn.ml.org/www.netscum.net/index.html

It does do very interesting things with cookies. it also allows you to
customize the typeface, the size, and the color of the text using the
cookie. Be sure at least to watch the cookies coming in on this and any
other site.

Would there be any interest if I put an anootated netscape cookie file
(cypherpunks cookie potluck) someplace like geocitie.com?

Also a composite blockfile for junkbusters and other filtering proxies.

A really neat feature for ad-filtering proxies would be to be able to
place a specified picture (or at least a black rectangle) over a jpg or
gif file being received from a URL that matches a specified pattern.
I'm not sufficiently handy with graphics file formats to tell how easy
this would be.
