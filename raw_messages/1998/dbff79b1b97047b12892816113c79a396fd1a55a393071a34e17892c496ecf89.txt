Fast Enhanced Historical Currency Table

Fast Enhanced Interactive Daily Table
   - http://www.oanda.com/converter/cc_quotes

Due to the quickly increasing access to our two new products,
we have adopted the fast cgi approach for both products.
Furthermore the choice of output as HTML, ASCII and CSV 
facilitates the importing of data into spreadsheet solutions.
If you do calculations with multiple currencies, you can
now easily get the necessary rates into your spreadsheet.

Improved Personalization of converter services
   Description of manual editing for all converters:
   - http://www.oanda.com/site/personalize.shtml
   Interactive Interface:
   - http://www.oanda.com/converter/classic?do=pref

Taken into consideration all the suggestions we have
received, we now offer many personalization possibilities
for all our converters including the customized versions.
You can now select a personal list of currencies or, if
you prefer, you keep the whole list, but your most needed
currencies always appear on top of the menu. Therefore
you can generate converters personalized to your needs
of currency information.

and the Interactive Daily Table:
