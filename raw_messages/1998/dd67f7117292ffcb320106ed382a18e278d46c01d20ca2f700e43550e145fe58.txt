Hi !

January 1st was the official launch of the most powerful           
business opportunity in the history of networking.

Here's your chance to get in on the ground floor and sieze an 
opportunity to take advantage of electric utility deregulation and
realize some of those dreams you've been dreaming.

When the telephone industry deregulated, millionares were made. 
At $215 Billion as an industry, Electric Utilities is 10 TIMES
the opportunity that long distance telephone was.
