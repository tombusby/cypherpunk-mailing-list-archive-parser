some people objected to my last post ranting about MS
tactics relative to the browser market. there has been
a remarkable development that shows how MS deliberately
attempts to "sabotage" markets through FUD etc.... an
internal policy memo that discusses their tactics leaked
to the public..

good article on Slate about how MS is attempting to
sabotage the growth of new free linux software through a systematic
strategy of "decommoditizing" or "embrace and extend" where
some people call this "copy and corrupt":

if MS's strategies in the world were as simple as "make
good products so people will buy them", who could complain?
but they constantly see software development as trench
warfare and a bloody, no-hold-barred melee. I'm positive
they will be chastised after this antitrust trial finishes..
we'll see..
