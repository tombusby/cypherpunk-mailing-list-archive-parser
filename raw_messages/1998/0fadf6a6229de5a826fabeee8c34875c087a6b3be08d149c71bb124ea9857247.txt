     Clearly, Hayek's analysis of power & the state has been superseded
by a far more nuanced view.  But, just for old time's sake, I would like
to try arguing that Hayek's (and, in fact, the Old Whig/classical
liberal) perspective may still have something to offer us that these new
views, as explicated by Williams & Davis, don't seem to have.
     Please chalk up unrelated attempts to defend Hayek to my current
fascination with "pietas", now that I've finally figured out what my
Latin teacher meant by that.

     Perhaps I'm thinking about the wrong time horizon, but it seems to
me that the 170 million or so that were marched out to the killing fields
in this century might have had some not entirely irrelevant fears of the
"planning state".  Certainly, despite my understanding of the inherent
instability of the Total State, I thank God regularly that the US hasn't
yet gone through that awkward transition period between the birth of the
Total State & its demise.
     Foucault is probably correct that we are beyond the centralized
state.  But I can't help recalling to mind my re-reading the other night
of the first chapter of R. J. Rummel's _Death By Government_ in which he
details the numerous slaughters (most by centralized states) that have
occurred throughout history prior to the 20th century.  I hope very much
my pessimism about human nature will be disproven, but I think I'll keep
my eyes open just in case.

     Given all this I'm not quite sure what to make of Hayek's personal
efforts, like the Mont Pelerin Society, or of the rumours that Hayek's
writings have had & continue to have an influence on those suffering
under totalitarianism & looking for a sign of hope.
     To be sure, this may be very distant from the sort of participatory
politics that Foucault understands to be effective, but it seems unfair
to say that Hayek had no strategy of resistance at all.
     My own reading of Hayek is of a man who was (since roughly 1922)
engaged in a lifelong resistance against state power.  Admittedly, his
strategy may seem extremely subtle & long-term, but I might even go so
far as to claim that his strategy has already had some effectiveness in
its own small way... And that his intention was that its greatest impact
wouldn't hit until well after his death.

     One might even say that, in the context of a classical liberal
political discussion, the term "power" is short for "state power", (or,
perhaps, coercive power).

     It's probably just six of one, half dozen of another, as you imply.
Though it occurs to me that Rummel's particular concern about the state,
(that it will slaughter its citizens and whoever else comes under its
power), would be allayed in the situation described.  So in this
particular sense, (1) might be the most useful claim to be made.
     It further occurs to me that if Rummel is right, that a society in
which the rule of law is diffused & widely practiced will not kill its
citizens, then would could conjecture that such a society might even
afford more liberties than just to retain one's life.

     I think this is an excellent point.  Perhaps it's just taste, but
I'm a bit bothered by speaking of the political character of customs.
Certainly customs, (and non-state institutions, like the family &
friendship), have political implications, but to talk about their
political character seems to me to let politics eat too much up.  And I
think we've had quite enough of that.
