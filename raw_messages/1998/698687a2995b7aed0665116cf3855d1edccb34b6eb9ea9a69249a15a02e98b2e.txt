The answer depends very much on what your goals are.

I am aware of the allegations, yes. I would not be surprised if
they use this tactic. If I were in their position, and my job
were to at least try to read every message sent by every foreign
governments, especially those under crypto I suspect I would
try very hard to limit the amount of strong crypto that these
governments have. This may mean limiting the amount of crypto
that the citizens of the U.S. have. So be it then. The NSA
does not have the job of ensuring unbreakable kick-ass privacy
and crypto to the public. Their job is to read the Other Guy's
messages, and to make sure the Other Guy can't read Uncle Sam's
messages. We speculate that they do both reasonably well.

I am reminded of the cypherpunk's charter. We have to create
privacy for ourselves. We can't expect others to not get in
our way or to help us out. This is reality.

Then you have little to say to me. I do not see the wisdom in
running commerce over a shit-box communication system like our
internet is. The technology sucks. The protocols suck. The
implementation of those protocols suck even more.

> crypto will help secure it further.

This implies that it is not secure now, yes? Why the hell would you
run commerce over something that you know is fundamentally flawed?
It lacks wisdom.

Right. Whatever. So then I suspect that you support any jackass running
around with a duffel full of C4 then, right? After all .. its all
technology. Science is pure; technology is using science as a means to
an end. That end defines whether or not we are talking about a psycho
with a bunch of C4 or a responsible civil engineer preparing to take
down a building in a controlled fashion.

This is not to imply that crypto is like C4 .. it isn't .. however
we must remember that while the mathematics of crypto are pure, we
can use that basis for a variety of things. One of them is authentication
the other is confidentiality. The FBI has no problems with the engineering
having dynamite out on the street, but they will get really pissed if it
is some average Joe. The NSA doesn't care about American's using strong
crypto (presumably) and they don't care about foreigners using
authentication technology. 

This 'artificial distinction' is a very real one.. it is the difference
between a terrorist authenticating himself as a terrorist or keeping
the fact that he is a terrorist (and his next target) a secret. 

I am not claiming that I think misuse of crypto is a legitimate reason
to bottle it up, but one must be reasonable and look at it from NSA's
perspective.

If the NSA is so far ahead of the general public in mathematics,
then yes.. considering that the NSA's job is to break crypto, we
should feel that we are getting our money's worth. Now, whether
or not we want to spend our money on that in the first place is
a different story. Selling me a champion racehorse for $1 is a
damn good deal, and it is worth the money.. but I don't have much
use for a horse.

Then don't pay taxes. It is a rather simple fix. I don't like big
government much myself, but I'll be damned if I am going to piss and
moan and claim that it is the root of our evils. It isn't .. rather,
our evils give birth to such monstrosities in the first place.
