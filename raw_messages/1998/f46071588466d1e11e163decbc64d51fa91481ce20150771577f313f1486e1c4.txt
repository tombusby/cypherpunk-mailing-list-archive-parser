The FCC ruling is a result of lobbying by a company that has actually built such a  location device. The requirements are tailored to the capabilities of their device and they probably expect to automatically win the contracts.  I don't remember their name but the devices need to be installed in about one out of 3 cellular base stations. 

I am only guessing now, but it's not unlikely that they have been assisted in their lobbying efforts by certain three-letter-acronym agencies. They knew that the goverment would look favorably on a device to track people and would eagerly buy their excuse of 911 caller location.
