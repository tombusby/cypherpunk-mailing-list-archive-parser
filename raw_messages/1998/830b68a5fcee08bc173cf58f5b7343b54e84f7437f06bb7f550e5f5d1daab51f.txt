If the keys aren't easily obtainable, the hash of them is no use
either, so we are already relying on the availability of other text.

If the information was valued people would keep copies and mirrors.
They could for example post it to the eternity service if/when a
viable service is realised.

I viewed it more as a way to strengthen the web of trust rather than
an expensive long term paper based web server.

I think it would be ok for our purposes to omit a URL, firstly because
URLs don't always last that long, and secondly because we want to
reference the publication, but aren't really bothered about having the
application reference us.

Oh.  Not so good.

Well theoretically we could go for 32 characters for a MD5 hash output
only.  SHA1 would be better at 40 characters.  (We could brute force a
hash length reduction and maybe claw back 4 characters at an expected
cost of 2^32 hash runs).

The printed hash could be the output of the hash function run on a
text document including the keys which we mirror in various places.
We can include any text we want to authenticate in this document,
keys, time stamp hash tree outputs, URLs, mailing list addresses,
whatever.

We are at 40 characters for an SHA1 output, or maybe only 32
characters with a bit of brute-forcing.  

What do you mean that you must include ID?  Someone must give an email
address, or phone number?  Should be ok to fit one of those in the
remaining 24 - 32 chars.  Or a URL.  "jya.com" easy.

Doesn't sound news-worthy itself.
