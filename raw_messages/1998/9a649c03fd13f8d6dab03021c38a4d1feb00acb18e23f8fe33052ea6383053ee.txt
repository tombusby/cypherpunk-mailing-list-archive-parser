HOUSE APPROVES Y2K BILL

 The U.S. House of Representative has voted
407-3 to authorize the president's Council on the Year 2000
Conversion to take control of computer systems of critical agencies
if they're unlikely to be able to avert a crisis because of the Year
2000 software problem, in which old programs using 2-digit codes for
years will be unable to do correct date-based calculations.  The
Senate has not yet voted on the measure.  (AP 13 Oct 98)
