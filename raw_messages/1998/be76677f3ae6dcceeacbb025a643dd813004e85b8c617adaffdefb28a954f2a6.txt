That works in that scenario, but you do have to monitor *every* house, and
continually, if you want to catch a software pirate.. in the satellite
scenario, they're just looking for a signal to see if it exists or not.  In
the M$ scheme, you'd have to get the license key and compare it against a
database to see if that license key was in use by anyone else at that exact
moment... it's not illegal to use multiple copies of the same piece of
software, it's just illegal to use them concurrently.
