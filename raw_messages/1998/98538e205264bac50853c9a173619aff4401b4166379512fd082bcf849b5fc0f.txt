 Charges Dismissed in Ruby Ridge Case
  BOISE, Idaho  -  A federal judge on Thursday dismissed an involuntary
manslaughter
  charge against an FBI sharpshooter for the death of white separatist
Randy Weaver's
  wife during the siege at Ruby Ridge.
    U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge ruled that Lon Horiuchi was acting
within the 
  scope of his authority and was honestly discharging his duties when he
fired the shot
  that killed Vicki Weaver on Aug. 22, 1992.
    The U.S. Justice Department decided in 1994 against prosecuting
Horiuchi, or any of
  his FBI superiors and reaffirmed the decision last year.

1  It was NOT a jury which made the determination Horiuchi was acting
within the scope
   of his authority, but a FEDERAL JUDGE.
2  The Justice Department did not prosecute FBI agents

  FASCISM -   a political and economic movement, strongly nationalistic,
magnifying the rights
  of the state as opposed to those of the individual, in which industry,
though remaining largely 
  under private ownership, and all administrative political units, are
controlled by a strong central     
  government.

Morales and I were unable to meet on Thursday.  Today we will study the
docket sheets view at
http://www.jya.com/whp-10usca.htm today.  And open the letter I received
from EEOC Inspector
General Office.

The above Ruby Ridge article emphasizes the importance of a jury trial
in matters of federal 
government misconduct.  http://www.jya.com/whp043098.htm

This matter should get settled before it gets WORSE.

Later
