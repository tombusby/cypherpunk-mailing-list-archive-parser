Make that instant key changes for mixmaster remailers by using forward
secrecy and direct IP delivery to enable the interactive
communications pattern required for immediate forward secrecy.  Ulf
Moeller (current mixmaster maintainer) has this on his to do list I
think.

Even for email, I spent a lot of time arguing with PGP Inc employees
about how forward secrecy could be obtained within PGP 5.x.  (The
OpenPGP list seems to have gone dead... wonder what is going on.)

The separate encryption and signature keys provided by PGP 5.x /
OpenPGP allow you to have short lived encryption keys, and longer
lived signature keys.  The web of trust is provided by the signature
keys.  PGP 5.x implements automatic key update.  It is cheap to
generate new Elgamal keys every week or day or whatever if you share
the public prime modulus.

You can also opportunistically send use once Elgamal keys in messages
which allows someone to have even more immediate forward secrecy.

In addition you can use interactive forward secrecy between mail hubs,
and you can also authenticate this with PGP's web of trust using a
design I posted to cypherpunks and ietf-open-pgp towards the end of
last year with a subject of something like "PGP WoT authenticated
forward secrecy".
