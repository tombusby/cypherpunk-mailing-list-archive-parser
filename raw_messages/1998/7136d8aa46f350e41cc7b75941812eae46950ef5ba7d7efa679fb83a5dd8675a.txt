Given that the EFF has demonstrated hardware capable of breaking DES in a
short period of time, they should now form an industry alliance asking for
general export permission for DES. If law enforcement ever needs to access
any encrypted data, they can bring it to EFF, along with a court order, and
EFF will "recover" the key. This should be allowed under the existing Key
Recovery exception, which says things are exportable if you provide the
government with a mechanism for getting at the keys!

Of course, some will claim that EFF is selling out to Big Brother by
manufacturing this technology, and that granting export permission for DES
will only prolong the pain of export controls. Others will claim that it is
wonderful that we have finally developed a technology that solves once and
for all the crypto debate. Flames will ensue.
