This is the real fault with the conference mentality...

How can anyone reasonably expect 35 people, invitation only or not, to have
a clue about any aspect of the industry let alone some sort of birds eye
view?

I would wager that if we took the top 35 ISP's in the US they couldn't come
up with a cohesive expression of viewpoint that would have a lifetime
measured in anything more than a few weeks.

Pure hubris.
