So you've got a set of arrays that have 256 numbers in them, whether they
are random or not is irrelevant since we're going to sort them and break
their randomness. It is merely sufficient that they all be reasonably (what
the hell ever that's going to mean) different, if they're all 6's for
example it isn't going to be very interesting.

If I understand the process. Each array would cycle through in parallel
sorting 2 elements of each array. Once that was finished we'd then sort the
arrays themselves according to some process. From your description it seems
to imply that you're going to sort the 1st element descending at that point.
This in effect mis-orders each array after every sort.

This sort of system is an IFS and could lead to determinism (ie a cycle of
sort patterns that repeat endlessly) or chaos (ie a pattern that doesn't
repeat). It in and of itself doesn't guarantee any randomness merely a
continously munged sort.
