Feds Assault the Free Press

 By Kelly Patricia O'Meara

 A journalist and his wife have drawn the wrath of
 federal law enforcement. Their 'crime': allegedly
 removing a tiny piece of TWA Flight 800 wreckage
 for independent study.

It was FBI Special Agent James Kinsley who insisted the
 accused subjects be handcuffed and driven in separate
 FBI vehicles to U.S. District Court in Uniondale, N.Y.
 Secured by heavy manacles, the prisoners were paraded
 before media eager to get a look at the husband and wife team
 charged with the alleged crime of stealing evidence from the
 hangar where the wreckage of doomed TWA Flight 800 is
 being assembled. 
 
. . . . But something was very wrong. The prisoners were Jim
 Sanders, author of nonfiction books including The Downing of
 TWA Flight 800, and his petite, soft-spoken wife Liz, a retired
 flight-attendant trainer for TWA. The two spent hours in
 holding cells under the court house not far from where the 747
 exploded in a deadly fireball on July 17, l996, before being
 allowed to plead not guilty to the government's charges. If
 convicted, this couple, who just celebrated their silver wedding
 anniversary, face up to 10 years in prison.
