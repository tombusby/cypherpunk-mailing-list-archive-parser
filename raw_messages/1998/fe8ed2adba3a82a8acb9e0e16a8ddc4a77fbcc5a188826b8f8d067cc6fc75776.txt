Morales http://jya.com/whpfiles.htm and I had lunch at Wendy's at 11:30.

I read drafts of Morales upcoming filings.  And discussed legal
strategies.

After lunch, I went to the National Atomic Museum on Kirtland AFB.

The museum is across the street from Sandia.

They now charge for admission ... but I made it in for $1 as a senior
citizen.

The museum main hall tour is laid out by history date of radiation.

The self-guided tour gets interesting about the time of Hahn,
Heisenberg,
Fermi, Lawrence, ...  Then it gets into THE BOMB.

Lots of picture of the '50 NTS site explosions.  But as we know from
Carole Gallagher book's American Ground Zero a DOE employee is quoted
"Those Mormons don't give a shit about radiation."

After touring the main hall, I went back to a wall display near the
bathrooms.

There they have a rather-large display on LANL mathematician Stanislas
Ulam.

Ulam's thing was Monte Carlo computations.  These use random or
pseudorandom
numbers.

Ted Lewis told me that they now use the gfsr at LANL for its nuclear
bomb 
simulations.

But this is how the mess got started.  Me making contact  with a
Japanese 
professor who developed a new method for selecting the binary seed
matrix
for the gfsr.

I went into the gift shop.

I bought John Young a refrigerator magnet PROUDLY proclaiming

	1945 509th COMPOSITE GROUP 1995

           FIRST ATOMIC BOMBARDMENT

             50th ANNIVERSARY

and Orlin a colorful red and orange postcard which reads on the back

	                       Trinity
	On July 16, 1945 at 5:30 AM, at a site code-named trinity,
	approximately 130 miles south of Albuquerque on White
	Sands Missile Range, the world's first nuclear device was
	exploded.  The explosion, equal to 20,000 tons of TNT, was
	was seen and heard over the entire state of New Mexico.

Great article, Orlin. http://www.aci.net/kalliste/speccoll.htm
Madsen did good too.  http://caq.com/cryptogate

Let's all hope Congress, unlike the bureaucrats, see the merits of
getting 
the requested documents posted on Internet.  And on to settlement of
this 
UNFORTUNATE matter.

Later
