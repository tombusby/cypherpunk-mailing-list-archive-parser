Subject: GE - Icelandic DNA database

This is from the genetics mail list. Can you help to circulate as they
are asking for foreign intervention in the form of an e-mail campaign?
I suspect that once governments can point to one country that has this
sort of database in place it will be used as an example of what the rest
of us should be aiming at...ycchhhh!!!

>The controversial health database bill has been passed in
>the Icelandic parliament. It was approved by a vote of
>37 in favor, 20 saying no, and 6 MPs absent. Before the
>bill becomes a law it must be signed by the President of
>Iceland, Mr. Olafur Ragnar Grimsson.
>
>Several wide-ranging changes were made to the bill in
>the last few days. Personal protection was decreased by
>stating specifically that the licensee use unencrypted
>health data. Even more blatant is the new provision in
>the bill that the database contain genetic information.
>Formerly it was to contain only health information from
>hospital charts and doctors records.
>
>For those who have been following the discussion,
>it will be of interest to know that the bill is in
>fact now a new bill--a result of the collusion between
>the Ministry of Health, the government and deCODE
>--and the database has now become the Icelandic DNA
>-collection bill or the pharmacogenetic wonderland
>bill instead of a health database bill (see also letter by
>Bogi Andersen to the editor, Science, Dec. 11, 1998,
>p. 1993).
>
>If there was any doubt as to whether an individual will be
>personally identifiable, now it is certain that every
>person can be traced, either individually or through
>pedigrees, by using genetic tracers or DNA sequences,
>in the near future. The consequences of including
>genetic information are momentous. Therefore:
>
>1. The database bill should not be made a law nor
>should it be implemented, because of ethical, privacy,
>consumer and human rights concerns.
>
>2. If there is to be a health/genetic database in spite of
>these concerns, informed consent and independent
>ethical review committees are minimum requirements.
>
>The Icelandic Research Council which supported the bill
>has abruptly withdrawn its support following an emergency
>meeting on Dec. 14 because of the inclusion of genetic data
>in the proposed database and infraction of free scientific
>research.
>
>Likewise, the former President of Iceland, Mrs. Vigdis
>Finnbogadottir, who sat on the Board of deCODE has
>resigned due to conflict with her role as President of
>UNESCO's World Commission on Scientific Knowledge

>deCODE's statement that personal information will be

>An ethical committee was introduced in the latest version of

>
>Also, parliamentary majority spokesmen have dicussed the

>drug stores in the database! This is not specified in the bill
>but could be in later revisions, according to newspapers
>supporting the government. This would be similar to turning

>The Icelandic database bill has been considered by numerous

>is considered in the Economist (Dec. 5-12, 1998) and New Scientist
>(Dec. 5th, 1998) to set a precedent of how medical and genetic
