Natrificial's "Brain" product did the same thing, silently, or at least via
a nonobvious option setting that was not explicitly documented.  The
transmittal of all your URL's to the mother ship was how they would inform
you that you were hitting a page specially enabled for their S/W.  Totally
unnecessary, as the page, if so enabled, would be perfectly capable of
notifying the browser with the addition of a trivial plugin, e.g. or other
thing.  I raised the issue of disclosing this kind of thing and got the
usual "we're technology users too and we'd NEVER do anything with that
information..." response, like it's no big deal.  I stopped using and
recommending the product, even though it looked like with the proper option
setting I would no longer be reporting my bizarre habits to Natrificial.

This shit's outta hand .....
