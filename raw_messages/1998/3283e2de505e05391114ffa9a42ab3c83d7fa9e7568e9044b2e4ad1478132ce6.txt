I  like this for starters:

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the
press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition
the Government for a redress of grievances. "

Of course, some in Washington consider this to be a seditious sentiment.

But serious, "Information Security" is asking for too much. He is asking us
to give our personal opinions about the "most elegant" arguments. Debates
about key escrow have been raging for almost five years now. He's not
likely to get new arguments here, or newly-written articles.

I urge him to either consult the archives of this list or the thousands of
articles in many places.

Search engines are a good way to find them.

Of course, I expect various folks will answer his call and write down their
reasons. I just doubt strongly that they'll be arguments as good as what
was written years ago.
