Could someone grep their news spool for a few hundred of these signatures
and post them here?  We can do statistical analysis on them and determine
whether they all appear to be modulo the same q value.

If they are DSA signatures, they should all be mod q, where q is some 160
bit prime.  Whether everyone uses the same key or different keys, they
probably all share p and q.  In that case the histogram of the values should
be flat up to a cutoff point.  We need to collect some hundreds of these
values in order to distinguish them from random 160 bit values.

The largest q value found in a dozen or so alt.weemba messages from
dejanews started with 0xc0, so q must be at least this large if they
are DSA sigs.  This amount of data was not sufficient to distinguish
from alternate theories, such as that each person has a random 160 bit q.
