    	are you paranoid?  "dread" is a contributing factor to paranoia.

	dog days of summer --are you nuts? or just referring to Toto again?

	cowardly.  see Dorothy for counseling.

	great truths are built on small truths and fallacies are destroyed

    a disgusting comment which fits a research (bio)chemist in Turkey
    where birth control reminds me of:

   	the father of the bride, who was marrying a Turk, told her that
	she was not required to submit to the Turkish indecencies, and
	if her about to be husband told her to "roll over", she should
	refuse.

	everything was fine for about a year until one night the husband
	told her to "roll over" --she refused; and when questioned, she
	told him what her father had said. his reply was quite simple:
	"but you do wish to become pregnant, dont you?"
