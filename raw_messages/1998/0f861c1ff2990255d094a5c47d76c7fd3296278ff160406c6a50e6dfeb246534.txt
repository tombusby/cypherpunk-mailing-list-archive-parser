Imposed by a gun.

What about it?

The Soviet Union is a prime recent example. British Mercantilism.
Governments are ultimately bound to economics in the sense of human behavior
and productivity -- the more they deny the nature of microeconomic actors,
the quicker they self-destruct.
History shows that every dynasty well eventually self-destruct, to think
ours won't is foolish. My point is we don't have competitive governments per
se, you have a power void that is filled by new government that can be just
as hostile to those microeconomic actors. All our government failures have
yet to produce a sustainable government.

> False distinction. Politics is about control and power

The fundamental laws of economics are supply and demand. As soon as you
through force into the equation, it is no longer economic, it is political.

> in human society that breaks down to force and money.

The essence of money has no political roots. The essence of money is human
productivity and trade.

Money is tied to politics currently because it is regulated by force of
government and the money *supply* is created by government fiat.

> There you go again, confusing privacy with economics...

The discussion *was* *privacy*, or did you completely miss the initial
discussion? Privacy (as opposed to secrecy) is about discretionary
disclosure of information. To invade privacy is to remove or prevent that
discretion. There is an economic cost of doing so, and an economic benefit.
Corporations are bound by those economics, whereas government can mandate
transparency by whim and gun.

It is the *nature* of regulation. The end element of any regulation is a
gun. Government is a natural instrument of collective legalized force by any
group that can influence it, and to think it can't and won't be influenced
denies human nature in regards to power. Every government is despotic by
nature, force corrupts.

The legal monopoly on the *initiation* of force. And in fact you have very
little freedom (eternally diminishing) to obtain potential force (arms) and
use it in a *reactionary* manner. You have absolutely *no* freedom to use it
reactionary against government (which is in the face of the 4th).

It is an irrelevant distinction in this case, it is all government. They do
not use force against each other as any sort of competitive balance.

General democratic consensus is highly controlled by media and government
propaganda (if they are not one in the same). What is the underlying
motivation?

Is hemp illegal because people don't want people to smoke weed, or because
of the cotton lobby?

Is the war on drugs so unbreakable because people don't want people taking
drugs, or because the government funds black operations with its sales, uses
it to confiscate private property, and as a sounding post for increased
powers?

Do people not want free banking, or does the government wish to protects its
fiat currency and artificial stability flying in the face of economic
reality?

Money or power, more often than most people think.

Provided you don't corrupt the meaning of free-market to include any
possible black market, then yes, there will *always* be a black market. It
can be made rather insignificant however.

And again you pervert the meaning of free market. I'm tired arguing that
subject with you, go read a book.
