"In Hayek on Liberty John Gray treats Hayek primarily as a philosopher. His
book is analytical, not hagiographical, and almost certainly the best book on
the subject.' - Samuel Brittan, Financial Times

'The most generally accessible book on Hayek so far.' - Anthony Quinton,
Times Higher Education Supplement
...

Hayek's achievements in social and political philosophy are increasingly
receiving full recognition. _Hayek on Liberty 3rd Edition_ is a concise yet
exhaustive and provoking study of this classic liberal philosopher which
examines the structure and impact of his system of ideas and locates his
position within Western philosophy. Not available since the 1980s this
up-dated 3rd edition contains a postscript which assesses how far the
historical developments of the last ten years can be deployed in a critique
of Hayek's thought. This book will contribute to a much needed wider
debate on the future of conservatism.
