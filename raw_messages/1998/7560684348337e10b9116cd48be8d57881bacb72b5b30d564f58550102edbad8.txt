Paul Dore, a British engineer involved in SETI research
who had picked up signals from a secret NSA/GCHQ 
intelligence satellite and believed them to be from outer 
space, was asked by the agencies on November 2 to 
cease and desist publishing his findings and to cancel a 
planned press conference to tell his latest news, or face
punishment under the Official Secrets Act. The agencies 
said the satellite was part of "Project 415."

This was noted here a few days ago, but that was before
Paul's description of the agencies' visit to his home
was pulled from its original URL, along with related files
which described his findings as well as confirmations by 
other researchers:

A Project 415 (maybe the same) was first reported by Duncan 
Campbell in a 1988 article in The New Statesman, in which he
also gave the first public description of ECHELON:

It may not be related to Paul Dore's situation but Duncan's
article has had some 9,000 downloads in the last 24 hours.
Anyone seen a news report on the topic?

Thanks to KF for the lead.
