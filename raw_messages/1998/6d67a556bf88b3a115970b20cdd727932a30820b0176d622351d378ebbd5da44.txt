Doxis, Inc. Announces Forms Without Paper Version 2.1 Computerized
Data/Document Input And Storage System 

New Release Lets Pharmaceutical Workers Input Process and Analytical
Forms/Data Into Secure Document Databases, With Improved Document Authoring
Features and Capabilities. Communicates With Key Enterprise Systems.

    NORWOOD, MA Sept. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- Lewis Bell, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Doxis, Inc., Norwood, MA, a pioneer and leader in the
development of mobile computer-based forms management software systems,
announced today, at WorldPharm '98, the latest version of Forms Without
Paper(TM) -- Version 2.1.

    Doxis developed and markets Forms Without Paper -- the first software
package that allows mobile pharmaceutical workers to input critical,
real-time batch process, research and analytical forms and data -- with
biometric signatures -- directly and interactively into a secure document
database.  The original data is locked into the form, the electronic
equivalent of the original paper copy.  However, data can also be made
available to enterprise databases without retranscription, and without
altering the original form. Forms Without Paper is a client server software
toolset that provides data for trend analysis, and can be customized to
interface to standards compliant MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems),
LIMS (Laboratory Information Management Systems), and ERP (Enterprise
Resource Planning) systems.

    Lewis Bell, Doxis, Inc., President and CEO, said, "Forms Without Paper
Version 2.1 features a more advanced and flexible document authoring
architecture designed to better facilitate and speed the process of
changing and revalidating forms.  This is a major breakthrough in
computerized data/document input and storage, and provides tremendous
advantages to pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to use electronic
records." 

    Forms Without Paper Version 2.1 provides a superior vehicle for the
collection of handwritten forms and data by mobile workers.  It bridges
gaps between the capture of handwritten, signed documents and data
collection in highly regulated industries such as pharmaceutical and HBA
manufacturing. These industries now have the ability to automate the
capture of these documents and data at the point of work.  They can also
share it over
worldwide enterprise systems, with their document management systems, and
with other systems, including MES and LIMS. 

    According to Bell, using Forms Without Paper Version 2.1,
pharmaceutical companies now have a way to computerize both their existing
paper-based batch records and laboratory data sheets that is based upon
their current paradigm, and, therefore, is intuitive, non-disruptive to
their operations, and painless to implement by industry standards.

    The software enforces version control and increased accuracy of data
collection.  It automatically verifies data integrity and applied
tolerances per field.  It proactively enforces compliance with SOP's, and
provides a
patented audit trail for changes.  The orms Without Paper client runs on a
pen-based terminal operating under Windows 95(R)/98(R) -- the equivalent of
an electronic clipboard.  The hand held unit communicates with the server
via wireless LAN.  The new release will be available in the first quarter
of 1999 to pharmaceutical and consumer product manufacturers subject to FDA
regulation.

    Bell is quick to point out that the new system does not obsolete
existing forms processes, but rather automates them, making them more
efficient and secure, and less error prone.  "Many companies do not want to
reinvent the wheel when it comes to processing the forms they use
throughout their operations," Bell states.  "However, they do want a better
way to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of their forms.  They want to
control their forms throughout their life cycles, as the valuable corporate
assets they are."

    Using Forms Without Paper, a worker now enters the data onto the
electronic clipboard using a pen, just as he or she would when using a
paper form.  The layout of the form is the same as the paper version, and
workers can also print out the paper form if they need to.

    As it is collected, information is date and time stamped, operator
identified, and secured within the intelligent form to provide a cGMP
compliant audit trail that will include all information captured in
association with the data.  Digital signatures that are captured are
non-excisable, and can also be verified to authenticate the entry, if
desired. Completed forms are stored in a Secure Document Database.

    Once transferred to the user's network, information is available to
backend ODBC databases, desktop applications, and ODMA standards compliant
document management software.  Forms Without Paper can also be used as a
front end to enterprise packages such as SAP(R) and BPCS(R), allowing
pharmaceutical
companies to extend the reach of these applications to mobile workers. 

    Training on the system is available, as well as consultation and
professional services, including validation services.  Distribution,
product support, consultation and professional services will be handled
through the
Doxis direct sales channel.
