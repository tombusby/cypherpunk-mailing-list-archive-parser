The Program Committee of the Digital Commerce Society invites any member of
the dcsb mailing lists to submit their proposal for a luncheon talk to the
Society.

Speakers can be any *principal* in any field of digital commerce. That means
anyone who is doing interesting research or development in, or who is making
significant market innovation in, the technology, finance, economics, law,
or policy of commerce on the global public internetwork.

The Committee tends to consider the person giving the talk first, and then
gives the speaker lots of discretion in the content of their talk -- as long
as it pertains to DCSB's charter to promote innovation in internet commerce.


The Society's meetings are held on the first Tuesday of the month at the
Downtown Branch of the Harvard Club of Boston, One Federal Street,
Thirty-Eighth Floor, in Boston, from 12 to 2 in the afternoon.

Unfortunately, the Society can not remunerate a speaker for any fees or
expenses other than, obviously, the speaker's lunch, and basic overhead
projection equipment. There is dial-up internet access for the meeting room.

If you, or anyone you know, are interested in speaking to the society,
please send, via email, a proposal, consisting of a single paragraph on the
speaker, and a single paragraph on the proposed talk, to Robert Hettinga
<mailto: rah@shipwright.com>, the chairman of the DCSB Program Committee,
and the Society's Moderator.

A list of previous speakers can be obtained with the following URL
<mailto:majordomo@ai.mit.edu?body=info%20dcsb>, or, if your
mailreader/browser doesn't support mailtos,

send

info dcsb

in the *body* of a message to majordomo@ai.mit.edu .

Thank you for considering DCSB in your speaking plans, and, if you have any
questions on your submission, please contact me directly.

Cordially,
Robert A. Hettinga
Moderator and Program Committee Chair,
The Digital Commerce Society of Boston
