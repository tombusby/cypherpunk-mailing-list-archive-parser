Of course not! The People's Socialist Nirvana of Oregon
is a foreign country. Just the fact that almost all
other foreign countries recognize the U.S. passport as
valid identification for things far more momentous than
the purchase of alcohol doesn't mean that the PSNofO
has to!

What do they require in Oregon? A little holographic
tatoo in paisley? A barcode on the tongue? Oh, I know!
A machine-readable ID on the inside of the rectum!

Has anyone figured out the obvious answer to this shit?
If you have, don't answer. And don't send me the bodies
by UPS collect, either.
