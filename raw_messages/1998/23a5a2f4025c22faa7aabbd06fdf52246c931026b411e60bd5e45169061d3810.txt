Boy, do I feel like an idiot!!!

I got my head out of my ass and checked out the headers on some
of the messages coming from the list and discovered that many
of them, including the one I am referring to above, are forgeries
by Ulf Moller (who has those two 'eyes' over the 'o' in his name,
just like the eye in the pyramid on the US dollar-bill, which 
means he must be a Bavarian Illuminati shill).

I would like to apologize to Tim, and to all of the other
cypherpunks that I have offended by my stupid, ignorant posts
and attitude on the list.
I'm not really a CypherPunk. I don't even suck cock!
(OK, I sucked my brother's cock a little, when I was younger,
 but that was just 'experimentation', OK? By the time I was
 nine, I had started fucking my little sister, so that *proves*
 I'm straight, eh?)

Anyway, I don't think we should put up with this shit from Ulf
(DoubleEye Illuminati) Moller. Let's all spam him.
