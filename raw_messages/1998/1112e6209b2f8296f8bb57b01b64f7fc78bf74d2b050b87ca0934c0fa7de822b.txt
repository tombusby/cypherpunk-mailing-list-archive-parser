Governors push national ID plan
Rewrite of executive order could be key

The National Governors Association would like to have a national ID system,
and plans to work with the White House to reinstate Executive Order 13083 to
make that a reality.

The bipartisan NGA is claiming much of the credit for stopping Executive
Order 13083, but they also plan to help craft a revised version of the order
that will alter the relationship between states and the federal government.

An internal document used by the NGA to inform all governors of their goals
and objectives was made available to WorldNetDaily, along with a "Fact Sheet
on Federalism" used by the White House staff. Both documents were provided
by a Republican source.

Each document shows that both the White House, and the nation's Governors,
plan to put the currently suspended executive order into effect.

"This is because of demands by citizens, businesses, and the federal
government to make all government more accessible and open," claims the NGA.
"Pressures for uniformity and simplification come from globalization in
trade and telecommunications policy, regional environmental quality
solutions, and a greater need for some type of personal identification
mechanism to combat fraud, crime, illegal immigration, and mismanagement of
funds.

Congress passed the "Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility
Act of 1996," which authorized the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration of the Department of Transportation to establish a national
ID system through the use of driver's licenses. Those guidelines are spelled
out in Section 656 (b) of the act. They include the use of Social Security
numbers on all licenses, and in all data bases beginning Oct. 1, 2000.

The act also calls for digitized biometric information to be a part of each
license, or "smart card." The biometric information will include
fingerprints, retina scans, DNA prints, and other similar information.

Thousands of letters of protest were received by the Department of
Transportation during a public comment period, which concluded in October.
The exposure of the plan in WorldNetDaily, and the outcry that followed,
prompted Congress to place a moratorium on the national ID, as well as the
medical ID law.

Congress included three clauses in the omnibus appropriations bill to
withhold funds for implementation of the national ID, medical ID and
Executive Order 13083. Apparently the governors are not pleased with those
actions, according to their document.

The documents obtained by WorldNetDaily clearly show that the NGA would like
to facilitate a national ID system, and the organization believes Executive
Order 13083, with some revisions, is needed to facilitate that.
