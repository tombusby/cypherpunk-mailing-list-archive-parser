Don't you think they are going to wonder why *that* line is so varied in
color? Or assuming deep color pallettes, why so many colors are selected
when only a few dozen are actualy used in the drawing?

I suspect they'll wonder why that particular file is so much larger than
the other graphics files with the same number of layers.

Look for the pixel that has the unique color mapped onto it.

And can't handle more than a few dozen colors and limited layering.

This suggestion is unworkable in application.
