"If you think of yourselves as helpless and ineffectual, it is 
certain that you will create a despotic government to be your 
master. The wise despot, therefore, maintains among his subjects 
a popular sense that they are helpless and ineffectual." 
                          --Frank Herbert, The Dosadi Experiment 


I don't think many cpunks (and other freedom loving people) are necessarily
nihilistic so much as they have come to the conclusion that to ignore and/or
subvert government has higher probability of success than trying to reform
it -- much to the demise of the Libertarian Party. The whole cryptography
and geodesic communications being the bane of the nation-state theme tends
to support this idea.
