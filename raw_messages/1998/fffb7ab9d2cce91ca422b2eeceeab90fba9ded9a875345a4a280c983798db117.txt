That should set off flags for truly honest politicians (talk about a non
sequeter).

This of course assumes that there is some faith in the system.

But the point isn't to vote for just anybody. I keep having this echo of
Federalist #5 (I think that's the one about political parties) going through
my head. The problem with our system is that we need a more representative
form of government. It shouldn't be simply a football game (which leads to a
related but deep issue about American psychology itself) but a fair and
honest representation of the peoples desire. The only things I can find that
would make such '3rd party' strategies work is if the representation was
done by percentage as in Englands parliament.

I'll think about this one. Several points come to mind and I'm not sure
how to express them at this point. The point I can address is that it isn't
that people voted for a drunk dwarve. It was the issue was so trivial or
irrelevant that it didn't matter who goes in there, it simply doesn't
matter. In that case the only answer is to opt out and spend ones time
dealing with the issues and problems that do matter.

The question is deeper than simply participation, it's addresses the entire
point of the system that needs our participation in the first place.

I'd guess they were testing.
