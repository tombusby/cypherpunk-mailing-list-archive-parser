U.S. Allows Export Of Crypto Product
(12/22/98, 5:38 p.m. ET)

Network security specialists ODS  Networks has won government 
approval to export its strong-encryption product to companies in 42 
countries, without a  government-backed key-recovery feature.

ODS, in Richardson, Texas, said it is the first U.S. company to 
receive a blanket export license from the Department of Commerce to 
ship its encryption product.  The government strictly controls the 
export of encryption products with a key-recovery feature and key 
lengths of 112, 128, or 1,024 bits. 

The ODS products use an alternate "stream recovery" feature that 
lets users protect encrypted data. The company said its 
stream-recovery scheme helps resolve conflicting requirements for 
privacy and monitoring. 

ODS said its objective was to introduce a monitoring capability that 
protects the rights of innocent third parties in criminal 
investigations.
