I played around with nytimes.com some more and I'm certain that it does check
for the presense the ID= in the cookie (but not the value).

Apparently the following 2 is necessary and sufficient:
NPLCNYT=(whatever it tried to set it to)
ID=(anything; I used ID=0 to save bandwidth)

With ID=0, it says "welcome, 0" of the first page and I see no problems.

A good idea. here are more of mine:

#.reference.com
wafer userid=cypherpunks@bwalk.dm.com
wafer passwd=cypherpunks

(I haven't been able to register cypherpunks@algebra.com on reference.com)

# amazon.com cypherpunks@algebra.com cypherpunks
wafer group_discount_cookie=F
wafer session-id=1451-4798095-404463
wafer session-id-time=886320000
wafer ubid-main=3578-1328899-434066
wafer cf=c90fe571f7b5f873

By the way, junkbuster does NOT strip cookies in secure http. Be careful.
