There is over 400 BILLION DOLLARS in unclaimed and 
lost money in North America and we want to help people 
get their money back! 

In a continuing effort to inform the public of this money, 
Personal Funds Recovery, Inc. is launching an INFOMERCIAL
to air across North America. This INFOMERCIAL will educate millions 
of viewers about the over 400 BILLION DOLLARS that needs to be 
returned to it's rightful owners.
 
We are looking for 300 INDEPENDENT AGENTS who will become 
a part of this campaign. Each Agent will own an exclusive territory 
and will receive a percentage of every lead generated from the national 
informercial!  Your involvement will be very financially rewarding.
