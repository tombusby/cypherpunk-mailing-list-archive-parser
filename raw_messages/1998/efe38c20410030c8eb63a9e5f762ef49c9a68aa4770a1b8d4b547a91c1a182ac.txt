STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION - Worldwide Caution
============================================================
PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT - WORLDWIDE CAUTION
 September 4, 1998


U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Office of the Spokesman


In light of the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya 
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on August 7, 1998 and the U.S. air 
strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan on August 20, 1998, the potential 
for retaliatory acts against Americans and American interests 
exists.  In addition, terrorists, including Osama Bin Ladin, 
continue their threats against the United States and have not 
distinguished between military and civilian targets.  We take these 
threats seriously.  The U.S. has increased security at United States 
Government facilities worldwide and a number of our posts have 
suspended or limited services to the public.

The Department of State reminds Americans to maintain a high level 
of vigilance and to take appropriate steps to increase their 
security awareness to lessen their vulnerability.  Americans should 
maintain a low profile, vary routes and times for all required 
travel, and treat mail from unfamiliar sources with suspicion.

American citizens traveling abroad should contact the nearest U.S. 
embassy or consulate by telephone or fax for up-to-date information 
on security conditions.  Current information on post operations is 
also available on the Internet at http://travel.state.gov.  In 
addition, U.S. citizens planning to travel abroad should consult the 
Department of State's Public Announcements, Travel Warnings, 
Consular Information Sheets, and regional travel brochures.

This Public Announcement replaces the August 20, 1998, Public 
Announcement Worldwide Caution and expires on December 4, 1998.
