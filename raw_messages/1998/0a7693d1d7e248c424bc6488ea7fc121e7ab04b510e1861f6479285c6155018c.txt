Meganet Corporation Ships Virtual Matrix Encryption Nationwide; New $1.2
Million Challenge Begins Today

LOS ANGELES, April 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Meganet Corporation, who challenged
Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT - news), Intel (Nasdaq: INTC - news), Dell
(Nasdaq: DELL - news), AT&T (NYSE: T - news), NCR (NYSE: NCR - news)
and many other high tech companies with their unbreakable encryption
is shipping VME98 nationwide. As of today, April 1st, 1998, anyone in
the continental United States of America can buy VME98 directly from
the Meganet web site at http://www.meganet.com. Prices for the standard
edition are only $100 for a fully operational application.

After 12 months of Research & Development, Meganet Corporation completed
21 different commercial versions of VME98 last month, and the product
is now being sold nationwide through the World Wide Web.

Virtual Matrix Encryption is the strongest encryption available today,
and the product is available ONLY in the United States of America. For
the time being, there are no sales in any other countries, though Meganet
Corporation is considering applying for an export license.

Meganet Corporation also keeps on working on standardizing VME with the
different standards committees.

Meganet Corporation is also launching their 3rd challenge which is worth
$1.2 million over the next 12 months. Starting today, and for the next 12
months, Meganet Corporation will post a monthly $100,000 challenge for
registered users of VME98. This new challenge shows Meganet Corporation
has absolute confidence that VME98 is completely unbreakable.

Today's date also marks 1 year from the first 1 million dollar challenge
that brought Meganet Corporation nationwide recognition. The challenge
lasted 45 days and over 55,000 people participated. None have succeeded.

Today also marks the end of the second challenge which lasted over 6
months, where Meganet Corporation challenged the top 250 corporations
in the U.S. to test and break VME97. None have succeeded. The challenge
solution will be posted on the Meganet web site at http://www.meganet.com.

Meganet Corporation has a U.S. patent pending for VME. The technology
uses a new field of encryption and a new algorithm to encrypt data
that is completely different from any existing method. VME is the only
algorithm that does not encrypt the data or transfer it. By comparing
the data to a random built-in Virtual Matrix, a system of pointers
is being created. These pointers are meaningless outside the context
of the matrix they belong to, while being repeatedly encrypted in a
plethora of algorithms. Even in the unlikely event that the algorithms
are compromised, the set of pointers discovered is completely unrelated
to the original data, and there is no way to derive the original data out
of the pointers set. The Virtual Matrix encryption enables the world's
first and only unbreakable encryption.

Encryption can be found at http://www.meganet.com.
