I expect so.  I also expect the spooks will be the ones submitting the
child porn to the service.

RICO may make holding a portion worse than the whole thing as it may
then be construed as a conspiracy, RICO allowing asset forfeiture.

Alternatively holding a portion makes it more difficult for the
attacker to determine who the holders are, and to mount a
multi-jurisdictional attack (eg seizing disks in multiple countries).

Not sure how it would work out in practice.
