I wonder who won the pool on how long you would last before departing
in a tiff. :)
 
But I digress.

I think that regulations which permit applied math to be patented are
counterproductive, as do many other countries.  Given that such
regulations are in place in the United States, one would expect them
to be upheld by the courts.  Whether any of this is "wrong" in some
abstract sense is a religious debate, in which I am uninterested.
 
Let us examine the two statements:
 
 I.  Certainly, given what was known at the time widespread
     data communications created a commercial demand for
     secure communication over insecure lines, a person
     setting out to create a software solution to the
     problem, knowing what was then known about
     cryptography, trapdoor functions, and other techniques,
     would almost certainly have employed modular
     exponentiation or discrete logs to solve the problem.
     If RSA hadn't been patented at the time it was, it most
     certainly would have been independently discovered by
     multiple individuals and widely employed, without the
     present licensing restrictions.  Prior published works
     on cryptographic trapdoor functions involving the
     factoring of composites and possibly even encryption by
     modular exponentiation existed long before the RSA
     patent.
 
II.  Obvious prior art sufficient [in the current regulatory
     environment surrounding patents in the US] to
     invalidate the RSA patent in court has never been
     published.
 
Now, given that these two statements are not opposites of each other,
one is not going to refute the first by stating the second, no matter
how big a bullhorn one employs.
 
>> There is a huge difference between "prior art" and "invalidating prior
>> art" under patent law.  Indeed, to invalidate the patent, it would

> It seems to me you are agreeing with my comment here.
 
I have only argued that obvious prior art exists.  I have also stated
that I would favor a regulatory climate in which such obvious prior
art would preclude a patent being granted.  I have never stated that
we currently live in such a regulatory climate.  In fact, we do not.
 
> Pretty far-fetched response. They tried to overturn the patent on

Many words, like "prior art," have specific legal meanings which
differ from their common English usage.  Kind of like economists
arguing that there is no "demand" for food by poor people, because
they have no money with which to purchase it.  I use the term "obvious
prior art" to mean prior publication of the essential methods and
techniques with which a technically skilled person, given the same
problem to solve, would arrive at the same or a similar solution.
 
Put two graduate students at opposite ends of a wire, with the world's
prior-to-1977 writings on cryptography, trapdoor functions, the
intractablity of factoring the product of primes, and the modular
exponentiation problem.  I suspect the RSA Public Key Cryptosystem
would not be long in emerging, even if one employed particularly dense
graduate students.
 
That is what I mean when I use the term "obvious prior art."
 
> Again, it seems you've conceded my point here. What part of "nobody"
> don't you understand?
 
I was proceeding upon the assumption that the enumerated "points" you
claimed I was making were ones with which you disagreed.  If that is
not the case, I am prepared to declare early victory.
 
"Nobody could afford to litigate [against RSADSI]" is misleading, as
even the wealthy don't employ the expensive option, when a cheap one
is available.  Besides, I have never contested that the current
regulatory climate supports the patenting of things like RSA even in
the presence of prior publication of the essential mathematical
elements.

There were plenty of companies who had the financial power to squash
RSADSI like a grape, and probably change the regulatory climate as
well.  There was no incentive for them to do so, and they probably
have applied mathematical patents of their own which they are fond of.
 
Had RSADSI sat on the patent, and refused to license it to others,
both they and their patent would probably have had a very short life
span.

Yes, the "method and apparatus" transformation.

They rarely litigate patents where the cost to litigate is enormous,
the technology may be cheaply licensed, and the chances of success, or
of even trying to explain the topic to the average layman, are
minimal.

Well, I suppose Vin could just be a bored essayist in need of

I think you are having some difficulty separating out the sarcasm
here.  Besides, the suggestion that Vin has a vested interest in
defending the RSA patent hardly translates into an assertion that
everyone who disagrees with me on some subject is someone's paid
agent.
 
Abstraction from the specific to the general is not an accepted tool
of inference.
 
You, for instance, are probably quibbling for entirely different
reasons.

That sometimes happens when one party "summarizes" a flame war, and
posts it elsewhere.  Deal.

"Practically anything" is not unequivocal, and is a correct
description of the current patent review climate.

Vin alleged that RSA being granted a patent proffered compelling
evidence of the unique worth of the thing being patented.  It is
correct to apply general comments about the patent-granting climate to
this specific case.  For a better example of confusing generals and
specifics, you may re-read your own comments on "if someone opposes
me, someone must be funding them" above, incorrectly abstracting my
comments about Vin to the general population. :)

Bzzzzzzzz. Wrong Answer.
 
And we will have to deduct additional points for abstracting again
from Vin to the general population vis a vis "Security Dynamics is
paying for those who opppose me."
 
The best you can get on this mid-term is now a C. :)

Most of the factual material refuted nothing I was claiming, and
refuted things I wasn't claiming, such as Jevon's book containing a
complete description of PKC, as opposed to being the earliest known
work which contained something related to the topic.
 
Again, an attempt to impress people with the volume of the evidence,
rather than with its quality, which when combined with the occasional
snide remark, meets my definition of "tirade."

His post is discredited because it fails to address any of my points
about the RSA patent, and instead argues forcibly for a collection of
self-evident surrogate issues, carefully selected for their ability to
be easily confused with the real ones.

"Demand" in common English usage means that something is being
clamored for.  In Economic terms, it means half of the phrase "supply
and demand" which is something entirely different, said economic
demand existing for anything which is purchased.
 
> that the demand curve has a particular (flat) shape, did you make that
> up or did you rely on empirical evidence?
 
I believe that surveys by privacy groups long ago showed that GAK/Key
Escrow/Key Recovery was not being clamored for by corporate America,
although attempts were being made to incentivize it by the
intelligence and law enforcement communities.

I was using "demand" in its ordinary English usage.  You were using it
as an economic term, in an attempt to call the mere fact that GAK/Key
Escrow/Key Recovery-enabled software was purchased at all "demand" for
it.  Which, to use one of Clinton's favorite phrases, was "technically
accurate, although misleading."  :)
 
> Or perhaps you meant to say that the demand curve as a function of X
> was 'one-to-one onto' itself.
 
Uh, no.  That was definitely not what I was saying.  I don't think it
is what you are trying to say either, but thanks for using "1-1" and
"onto" in a sentence about functions.

That would kind of depend on how "X" was priced, would it not?  If you
give things away for free, people will probably take one in case they
need it someday, as it costs them nothing.
 
This does not equate to "demand," or "clamoring."

That's one possible explanation.  To test your hypothesis, we should
see how well Vin's agreement tracks RSA's inclusion of additional
encrow/GAK/recovery features in the future.  He may have to change the
name of "The Privacy Guild" to something less impressive.

I'm sure you've been attacked before, by people a lot less nice than
myself. :)

Hmmm.  Well, patents on pure math are not allowed, ergo, math must
be suitably transformed in order to be patented.

There is a fundamental difference between telling me I cannot practice
modular exponentiation to communicate with people without licensing
it, and telling me I cannot make RDRAMs without licensing that.
 
I am unlikely to replicate the RDRAM design by accident.  I am quite
likely to derive a given bit of mathematics given the application for
it.
 
If RSA can be patented, why not something like Householder transforms,
or cluster analysis, or the quadratic formula?  Sounds like the
slippery slope to me.

There is a fundamental difference between a physical machine whose
design required the use of mathematics, and an abstract mathematical
transformation, which may exist only in an instance of some computer
program performing a certain task.

Again, returning to the top of our discussion, the existence of
"obvious prior art" for RSA in the common English sense meaning of
"obvious prior art" has little to do with whether patents are upheld
in the current regulatory climate in the United States.
 
It would be simple to test your hypothesis, by simply giving trapdoor
functions replete with useful identities to two people, and telling
they have to construct a common secret unknown to a third party
monitoring their communication.  I cannot imagine a technically
skilled person taking very long to make the transition from some
"one-way" functions, to a practical implementation of D-H, RSA, or
whatever.
 
That would be my definition of "obvious."

My statement is point "I" at the beginning of this message.  Please
re-read it and tell me whether or not you agree with it.
