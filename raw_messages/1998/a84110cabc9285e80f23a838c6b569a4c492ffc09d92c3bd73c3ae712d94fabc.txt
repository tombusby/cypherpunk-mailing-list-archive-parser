Its not bomb-making, its destructive testing apparatus :-)

Wasn't he talking about EMI, not actual frying of chips (e.g.,
puncturing the 100's-of-nm-thick gate oxides in MOS)?
I read only the excerpt, but isn't a spark gap used for 
generating a broad spectrum, including fairly high
frequencies (think tesla coil)?  

Digital circuits don't like transients in their signals.
High frequency RF is invasive.
Capacitors are cheap.
