FCC specs aren't real tight.

My old laptop*, which passed FCC specs (at least when it was new,
before being hauled around on airplanes and trains, dropped a few times,
having cooked parts replaced, and generally getting treated like a laptop),
broadcast enough emissions that its video would show up on my parents' TV
when used 2-4 meters away.  The video sync wasn't right, so there were
several hard-to-read images of the screen on the TV, but it was obviously
emitting enough that a properly tuned receiver could read it.
On the other hand, it doesn't bother my TV from 8-10 meters away,
but I've got cable, while my parents use Real Rabbit-Ear Antennas and 
some kind of antenna-booster widget.

I have heard that passive-matrix emits less, but I don't know
if that's true from a TEMPEST standpoint or only noise output.

It is a bit easier to put a laptop into an RF-shielded enclosure,
but enclosures that worked fine for harmonics of 4.77 MHz machines
don't necessarily block harmonics of 477 MHz machines :-)
especially critical are the penetrations used to get air and
fiber-optic connections through, which are basically waveguides -
once the wavelength of the signal is short enough, they lose.

* AT&T Globalyst 250P, which is a NEC Versa Pentium-75 with a Death-Star
painted on it.  It has the expensive active-matrix 24-bit-color 640x480
screen (sigh - I'd rather have had the cheaper 800x600 8-bit-color :-).
A couple years old, and the case was a bit dented so perhaps it had been 
more radio-tight when it was new.
				Thanks!
