Wrong.  As long as it's your own code you are talking about, you can
release it under whatever license you want -  e.g., you can give
away binary code as part of a proprietary application, and you can
give away binary and source code stand-alone under GLP, LGPL, BSD
license, Artistic License, whatever.
