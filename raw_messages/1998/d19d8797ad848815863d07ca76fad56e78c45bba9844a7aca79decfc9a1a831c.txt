The local radio station just played a soundbite explaining that the 
"Anthrax" was not viable, and could not have been used to develop a 
weapon. They went on to state that the perpetrator was a "disgruntled scam 
artist whose scheme to make money off the Internet had failed."

If they can't get anything out of the bio weapons angle, there's always 
the 'net angle. The news goobers are catching onto the concept of "object 
re-use."
