This is from UK Crypto, where the ISDN-snoop part of the EuroParl 
report on technologies for political control was cited and asked if true. 
Perhaps Jim Choate, Steve Schear and others might clarify.

I think this means I series - which are all public docs...

Yes - ok.  If you have a delinquent ISDN switch AND the totalitarian
state wants to bug you AND YOU choose to use a handset which 
DOES NOT break the analogue path between the microphone and 
the ISDN NTU / TA (all standard analogue phones break the circuit, 
AFAIK.  It's only the speakerphone gadgets that could be subverted.) 
Then I suppose this is possible.  But who gives a s**t about the .1% 
of vulnerable phones. And it would be dead easy to mod them to 
defeat any such attempt.  There are loads of easier ways to mount 
covert surveillance than screwing up the phone system!

   >and listen into conversations occurring near the phone,

ISDN is NOT a 'message switching protocol', and there is none as such 
on Sys X and Y, which use SS7 for inter-switch signalling anyway.  The 
ISDN interfaces and service are only defined for the ends of various types 
of subscriber line, as far as I remember.  What happens inside the provider
network is up to the provider and is not ISDN.

I'm much more concerned about the Echelon system which was (finally)
reported in the Sunday Telegraph just before Xmas.  This system, it is
alleged, can intercept and look for keywords in ALL international comms
traffic.  I believe this also gets a mention in the Europarliament report.

Vote early and often for freely available strong encryption!!
(whatever JR mutters about 'doing him out of his livelihood' :=)  )

Key escrow is another example of complete bollocks, IMHO.

Cheers
