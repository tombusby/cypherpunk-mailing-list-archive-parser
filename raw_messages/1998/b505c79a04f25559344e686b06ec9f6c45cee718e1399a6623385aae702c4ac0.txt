This is perfect if you don't mind being a participant...

Could you get a phonebook and make a list of the sweatshops. Enumerate them
and then select 10% (if that isn't too many) and find out how many and to
whom they sew their garments for?

Remember, you can't dominate a market that can't be saturated and you can't
saturate a local market unless you find a mechanism to keep outside
competition from moving in. Currently this is only possible in very strongly
regulated markets in control economies. This implies that, at least today
because of communications and transportation improvement, only markets that
are global (though it might also work on a national level) can be dominated.
That is an interesting aspect I hadn't hit on so far. I'll add it to the mix
and see what brews up...

Though, it does occur to me that the fact that OS/2 has a stronger faction
in Europe than in N. and S. America in relation to Microsoft may be an
indication that continental saturation is possible. Might be explained by
the fact that most businesses are continental and not international in scope
of sales.

I've got to go back to work now...I'll check in as I get the chance...
