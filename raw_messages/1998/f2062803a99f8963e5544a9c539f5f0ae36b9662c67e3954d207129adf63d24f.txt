Well, you *did* ask. Don't blame me. 

It is summed up well at:

or, more prosaically, at:

A transcript of an actual game can be found at:
http://www.lazarus.demon.co.uk/mc/mc100.html - he also has many other links
at: http://www.lazarus.demon.co.uk/mc/mc.html

The Encyclopaedia Morningtonia has more detail than anyone in their right
brain would want to know about the game  at:
http://aurora.york.ac.uk/mc_em.html

Here are the rules of a slightly different game that Richard may have been
