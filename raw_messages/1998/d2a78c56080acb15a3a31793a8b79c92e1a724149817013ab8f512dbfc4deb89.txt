as a minor correction, SWIFT 's main service is to exchange payment
messages to feed into e.g. Fedwire or CHIPS so that would be double
counting

slowly on that: payment systems costs represent what economists call
'specific taxes' that is they inflict deadweight losses on the economy. More
efficient payment instruments such as some being based on bearer
certificates would per se lower GDP but lead to higher demand in theory.
Its effect would be as instant as a cut in other broad ones such as income
or capital gains that is it involves lag.

On the actual percentage of payment systems costs as % of GDP my
estimates are way higher. By simply taking clearing float days of the major
retail, business and interbank instruments, the figure is more like >2%
with current (low) interest for the U.S. and even higher for Europe. This
does
not take into account that a more efficient payment system with a higher
money velocity would lower the demand for transaction money among other
effects.
