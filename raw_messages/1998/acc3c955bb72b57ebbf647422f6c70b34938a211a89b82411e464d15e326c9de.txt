Interesting, I like that.  It makes sense.  Bill Clinton knows all
about putting things in fromt of trains, like the two kids who found
his secret cocain dumping ground in Arkansas when he was governor, so
he dumped their two bodies on a train track and the train (spotting
them, like you said Ken) tried to stop but hit them.  Further
investigation found that they had died of a massive hemorage, but
Clinton's honest people told the public that they had "fallen asleep
on the railroad tracks and were accidently hit by a train." 
Convenient, if I've ever noticed.
    I guess the thing with trains is that they are fun and a nice
ride, but modern societies push to get there quickly escalates about
as fast as inflation, so the demand to fly is becmoming more popular
as time goes on.  I think in the future, the only need for trains will
be for shipping us cpunks off to the concentration camps, seeing as
most are only accessible by train or helicopter anyway.  We'll see
though.
