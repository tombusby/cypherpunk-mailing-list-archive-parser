11MHz base frequency won't produce a clean ring at 125MHz or 210MHz, they're
not a whole number multiple of the base. How is this accounted for? What did
he calculate the Q at? At what range was he picking up these harmonics as
well as the base? The lower harmonic implies a 4MHz beat and the higher a
1MHz beat, how did he account for these signals? Personaly I would be more
inclined to suspect the information was riding on the beats. He didn't
happen to measure the frequencies to 3 decimal places did he? Since the
components are most likely 20%, 10% at best. This would indicate that his
base clock was slewing from around 10MHz to around 12MHz, this would explain
the 1MHz and 4MHz beats anyway; sub-harmonics due to excessive slew-rate.

If he was seeing ringing it had to be very low power because such off-integer
resonances only occur in low-Q tuned circuits and that implies a very quick
decay constant because the majority of energy is being dissipated in heat.
So, in effect, Van Eck is claiming that the propogation attenuation of the
125 and 210 harmonics is lower than for the fundamental frequencies in a
low-Q tuned circuit? Or is he claiming the emitted energy of the harmonics
was higher than the base drive signal?

As I alluded to with the comment I made about integrating the received
signals. The easiest way to do this sort of stuff with a small budget is
with a flying capacitor integrator.
