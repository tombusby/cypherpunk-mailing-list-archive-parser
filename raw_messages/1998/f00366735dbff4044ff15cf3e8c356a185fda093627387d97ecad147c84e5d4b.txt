A long time ago, in a network far far away, when there were wolves in Wales
and Netnews still mostly ran over UUCP instead of that newfangled Arpanet, 
and the Center of the Earth was either allegra or ihnp4, there were
some people who accused Bell Labs and probably in particular Mark Horton
of spreading Netnews as part of a plot by The Phone Company to increase
telephone usage, since more netnews volume meant more long-distance minutes.

(Everybody tried to avoid knowing what the phone bills for
allegra and ihnp4 _were_, because even internal funny-money creates
some responsibility if you know you're spending more than $1M/year of it :-)
				Thanks!
