Thank you for requesting samples of Web Cards.
We will be sending you several samples and a brochure within 24 hours.

Web Cards can be used in so many ways that we've prepared a special free
report on how 50 businesses have used them.  To get your report, simply
send an email to ideas@printing.com and it will be sent to you by email
immediately.

Web Cards are easy to order too.  You can use the on-line form at our Web
Site www.printing.com or print the form and fax it to 908-757-2604 or call
us at 800-352-2333.  We're very helpful and will work with you to adapt
your site to a postcard at no charge.

After setting up your card (which takes about 24 hours), we'll post a
"proof" of what it looks like on the Web and send you the address for you
to approve.  And if you have any changes, don't hesitate, there's no charge
for helping you get exactly what you want.

In the meantime, if you have any questions or would like sample cards for a
specific type of business, please call us at 800-352-2333 or email me at
joe@printing.com.

Sincerely,

Joe Haedrich
President
