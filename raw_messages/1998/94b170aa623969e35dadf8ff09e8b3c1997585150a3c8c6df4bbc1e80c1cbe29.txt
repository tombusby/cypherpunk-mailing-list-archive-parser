The home page for the AES is http://www.nist.gov/aes/

There is a page with current attack/break information at:
http://www.ii.uib.no/~larsr/aes.html.

Bruce Schneier et al have done performance comparisons of AES algorithms;
links to their results at http://www.counterpane.com/AES-performance.html.
