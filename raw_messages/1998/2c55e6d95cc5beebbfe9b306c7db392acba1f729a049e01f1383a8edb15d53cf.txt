Well probably the most effective way is to just take out the command and
control center. Even this would only be temporary as the government would
just keep spending more tax money to replace everything and add more
security.

What we need is a mechanism to punish the politicians who go down the Big
Brother path *and* the companies who are making big profits helping them. 

IMHO the UK, and the rest of Europe, is a lost cause, it's sheeple are too
brainwashed (FWIW the US is not far behind). The wall in Berlin did not
come down because Communism is dead, it came down because the Communist
were in control on both sides. :(
