I visited the http://sbi.jus.state.nc.us/sor/ website, did a search for
"Gary Burnore", and the story is confirmed.  If it were a "load of
bullshit", I suspect that Gary would have had it hauled away by now.
There's even a mugshot there.  Gary Burnore, of course, is welcome to
post his side of the story if he cares to.

The date listed for his conviction is about the same time that Gary Burnore
was whining about some "anon asshole" whom he alleged had falsely accused
him of molesting his live-in girlfriend's teenage daughter.  She lived --
guess where -- in Santa Clara, CA.  It looks like Gary's rampage to get a
couple of anonymous remailers shut down for spreading "libel" was bogus.
If a story is true, it isn't libel.  And when he couldn't get them to censor
embarassing posts to usenet, the made-to-order "spam baiting" mysteriously
appeared, and finally finished the job.  Just a coincidence, I suppose...

Let me guess -- this "conspiracy" to make Gary Burnore look bad has now
infiltrated the Santa Clara Police Dept., the San Francisco Police Dept.,
and the North Carolina attorney general's office?

By definition, Gary Burnore is innocent of ANYTHING he's accused of. <g>
And since this is the same Gary Burnore who was so adamant that posting
publicly-available information to usenet was acceptable:
