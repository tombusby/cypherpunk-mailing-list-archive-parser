That's truly funny....

"We the people in order to form a more perfect union...."

How does the federal government gain priviliges and immunities (ala 16th)
that aren't defined in the Constitution or an amendment? (see 9th and 10th)

Read the last sentence of the rubber-clause.....any action or law that
derives from it is required to respect the remainder of the Constitution in
full (simply crossing a state border doesn't annul the Constitution). Since
that includes the 9th and 10th (in toto) they have themselves a quandry.

Personaly, I would trust an individual handling these technologies before
I'd trust a bunch of power-happy gun-toting morons acting in concert who's
answer to everything is "my boss told me to do it" and willingly deny their
duties as individual citizens in order to play their three-initial games.

I saw a comment the other day that the government (those who support these
world views I suppose) doesn't trust the people. I wonder why after reading
laws that are this poorly constructed. Whatever the hell the intent was it
wasn't to protect life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
