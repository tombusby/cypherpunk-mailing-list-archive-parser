I think it is more difficult to have a lightweight, portable, non-maintenance
intensive solution for tempest protecting a portable than for a big
desktop box.

A desktop box doesn't care how much it weighs.  It can even be put inside
a TEMPEST rack (I saw someone selling these at a convention once; I wanted
one, but didn't have any way to to ship it back to Boston.  Sigh), or just
TEMPEST protect the entire room.

One of the problems with TEMPEST protection is that the gaskets/etc. get
worn.  Or some stupid fsck paints the exposed copper in the doorway.  Or
whatever.  I don't think requiring that the thing be portable, lightweight,
etc. is going to make it any less likely to be damaged.  If the TEMPEST
protection is damaged, it's not as if a warning LED will come on -- TEMPEST
monitoring equipment is *way* too heavy to build into a laptop, so it will
fail silently.

Certainly the traces are shorter, there are no big antennas (read: cables)
connecting parts, etc.  The power levels are power.  There aren't any
power cords if you're on battery.

However, a lot of them have plastic cases and generally piss-poor shielding
of any kind, too.

According to the Anderson paper, certain kinds of LCD-TFT have *easier to 
monitor* emissions than monitors.  I have no idea which is the case, but
I'm willing to err on the side of paranoia.  I should scrounge up some 
TEMPEST monitoring equipment around MIT somewhere and test it, though.

It's an integrated component, no keyboard wire, so it's much less likely
to lose.

You need to worry about the mesh bag corrding/breaking/etc.  But yeah, this
is a decent technique.  I wonder how small the mesh has to be to attenuate
30-40db of signal in the relevant frequencies, and if that makes it hard to
see/type through.  I should figure out what frequencies are involved.

The paper pretty clearly says laptop LCDs are not sufficiently quiet.  Until
I read this, I was under the impression they were; perhaps passive matrix
screens are and active are not. (actually, I can totally understand that
wrt the pulse modulation not present in modern crts)

I used to work in the MIT Media Lab's wearables project -- we used
this kind of approach.  Something called a "twiddler" chording keyboard 
(unshielded; my advisor fled the country before I could get a shielded one
set up), attached to a "private eye" monocular display; some odd resolution,
again unshielded.  Attached to a standard portable PC, a belt mounted
PC, or whatever.

I was going to put together a TEMPEST resistant wearable at some point.  In
addition, a mesh cloak; we'd been doing some privacy stuff, and discovered
that there were penetrating cameras in use by some surveilance companies/etc.
for anti-shoplifting/etc. -- it would be nice to shield against them.  It
never happened, oh well.

I had a real bitch of a time finding open source TEMPEST information, which
is part of why the idea was back-burnered.  I think there is a concerted
effort on the part of the government to prevent open source discussion of
the topic, through manipulation of research money, etc.  Most of my 
information was general purpose EE stuff and some EMP-shielding information,
so perhaps I'm inclined to overkill (when dealing with EMP, you have to worry
about 3 second duration *changes* in the field, so your faraday cage needs to
be of uniform materials, joints need to be the same as the material, etc.  
In the absence of material to suggest otherwise, I think the same criteria
apply to serious TEMPEST shielding, in the 85db+ range.  There is some 
speculation that the SECRET TEMPEST specs are not sufficient to resist
some modern SIGINT technology, and that there exist unknown standards for
real protection for some applications.  Perhaps this is unjustified paranoia).

Even a passive component has a resonant frequency; if you're attacking, you
may know it and can take advantage of this (hinted at in the paper).  I
don't think the palmtop being low power necessarily makes it immune, although
I'd bet it's a bit better off than a laptop.

I think the real solution is just what Ross said -- software + hardware.
With the right font and X server frobbery, you can get *better* net
image/text quality with TEMPEST protection and anti-aliasing than with neither.
And it's a great safety net in case your hardware protection is compromised.

Once the current project which by now is becoming rather tired of being
brought up in passing rather than in a real comprehensive form is on its
way, I'm going to look at the TEMPEST wearable, maybe with a verified
cryptographic hardware implementation for the important stuff.

An interim solution of a nice greyscale antialiased font in a java window
serving as a console, even if only for things like the pgp xterm, would
be a nice interim solution.  Especially since it should only take a few
hours to do, if someone has some font manipulation tools.

I was originally thinking of modifying the text mode console drivers, but
they use DOS text mode, which can't deal with greyscale.  The solution
is to use SVGAlib, GGI, or an X application.  A really cool solution
would be to make the X server itself do this to everything on the screen.
XFree86 is way too nasty a codebase for me to modify in my spare time, though.
I think Linux-GGI is the proper way to do it.
