 Comment: 

 In an on-line poll of over 6,000 IT professionals (high), 61% plan to
take cash out of their banks. 

 This is from DCI (Nov. 11).

 . . . Almost eighty percent are taking steps to minimize the impact of
the Millennium Bug : 62.4 percent plan to avoid traveling by plane,  61.5
percent will withdraw money from the bank, and 58.6 percent  will purchase

Pointing the Y2K Finger

An online Year 2000 poll conducted recently by ZD Network News and The
Harris Poll Online reveals a mixture of confidence and prudent preparation
among a group of Y2K-savvy professionals. 

Of the 6,320 people who filled out the survey, 56.8 percent identified
themselves as full-or part-time I.T. professionals. Not surprisingly, 84
percent claimed to have a "good" or "complete" understanding of the Year
2000 problem. More than half are clear on who is to blame.

Sixty-one percent of respondents believe those who build, sell and use
computers, along with business leaders, are responsible for the Year 2000
problem. And don't look to place the blame on Uncle Sam. Only 23.6 percent
of those surveyed say they will blame the government in the event of Y2K
disruptions.

Happily, the news isn't all bad. A large percentage of respondents (75.2
percent) said their companies have taken steps toward Y2K compliance.
Sixty-two percent believe their company will be able to make the necessary
changes and create contingency plans in time to meet the Jan. 1st deadline.
A healthy 84.8 percent of respondents whose companies are actively working
on Y2K believe compliance goals will be reached. 

However, only 24.1 percent reported that the process was already complete.  

Over half of those surveyed feel they are more concerned about Y2K than the
majority of people. But panic has yet to set in. When asked to predict the
impact of Y2K only 21.3 percent said they thought it would be "very
serious." Almost two-thirds believe the results of Y2K will fall somewhere
in the middle ground between "negligible effects" and "doomsday." 

Respondents are taking precautions nonetheless. Roughly three-fourths of
survey participants have checked their PCs for Y2K compliance. Almost
eighty percent are taking steps to minimize the impact of the Millennium
Bug : 62.4 percent plan to avoid traveling by plane, 61.5 percent will
withdraw money from the bank, and 58.6 percent will purchase extra supplies
in case of a shortage.
