Section 8.  The Congress shall have Power      To lay and collect Taxes, 
Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common 
Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts 
and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; 

	No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State. 

(Note that it doesn't say "Congress shall make no law..." but rather is an
absolute prohibition of taxes/duties on exports of states. It therefore
falls under the "prohibited" clause of the 10th.)

As unconstitutional.
