A few months ago I posted statistics of the types of digital
signatures used on Usenet and in mailings lists. It turns out that the
moderators' signatures in a moderated newsgroup were tabulated for the
individual posters, resulting in somewhat too big figures for one
particular version of PGP.

Here are the current figures:

   56.6% PGP 2.*
   33.7% PGP 5.*
    3.6% other OpenPGP implementations
    4.0% S/MIME

The sample contains 249 unique (e-mail address, software version)
pairs taken from various international and local newsgroups and
mailing lists that happen to be available in my news spool (consisting
of some 24,000 articles). Perhaps someone with a full newsfeed
-- whatever that is in these days -- would like to try the same?
