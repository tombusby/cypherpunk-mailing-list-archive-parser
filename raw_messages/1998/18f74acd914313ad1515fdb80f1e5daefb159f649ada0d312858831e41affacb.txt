Hi Bernardo;

TEMPEST isn't a cipher, but a technique. 

Essentially, your monitor is a great big RF emitter. As it's electron gun
turns off and on to make the phosphor screen glow, it's emitting all kinds
of radio frequencies that betray the image on the screen. A tempest attack
is a receiver that can tune to a monitor, and reconstruct the image from the
RF the monitor is emitting. Supposedly such equipment costs about $500.00
