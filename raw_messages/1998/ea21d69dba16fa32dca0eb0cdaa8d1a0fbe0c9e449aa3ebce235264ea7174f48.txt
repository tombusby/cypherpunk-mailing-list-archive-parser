Its a STU-III, operating at 4.8kbps.  Which means that you lose the
shit sound of a normal cell phone, only to be replaced by the shit
sound of a 4800bit codec.

It is *not* recoverable encryption, because as the NSA and State both
know, there are security risks there.  And we all know that our
country's most valuable secrets are transmitted by people like
Madeline Albright, and thus deserve better protection than can be
offered by recoverable systems.
