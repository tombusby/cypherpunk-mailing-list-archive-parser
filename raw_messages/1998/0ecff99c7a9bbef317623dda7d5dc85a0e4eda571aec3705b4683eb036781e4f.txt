Hello out there.

I propose a question to the Cypherpunks  community.  Other than the
infamous Claude Shannon paper published in '49 in the Bell Systems
Technical Journal "Communications Theory of Secrecy Systems",  I am
looking for a good (maybe a more layman level, published in the last
decade or so, and available on the web)  paper describing the
relationship between entropy (of information systems) and secure
communication.  

If no-one has any good suggestions, maybe you could email me with your
favorite number or color or size of pants.  

Just kidding, what I am really interested  in is, is how much Jelllo
you can fit in  your left sock.  Or hell, send me your most
provocative pictures of Margaret Thatcher in the nude.

I am, in my uneducated state of fourth-year mathematics major at
Antioch College, attempting a research project in the field of
cryptography, and would appreciate citations of sources you consider
significant developments in the field of cryptography, in the last 50
years or so.  

But your flammability has nothing to do with this request for
information at all.

So, goddamnit, thanks for your help.
