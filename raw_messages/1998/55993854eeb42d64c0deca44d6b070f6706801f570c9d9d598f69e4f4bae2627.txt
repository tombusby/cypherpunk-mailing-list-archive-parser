Wayne doesn't set policy for SSZ. I must admit I'm at a loss as to why this
particular piece of info is the least bit interesting. While I have no
objections in principle somebody else will have to do the programming and
demonstrate it will work *before* it goes into place on SSZ. Wayne does have
permission to experiment on SSZ machines. The code must be stable *and*
fail-safe. Before it goes in it will be required to demonstrate various
failure modes.

Till you see the bill for supporting all those hip (sic) graphics and have
to spend the time responding to all the bitches about how long it takes for
end-users to get those pages to their machines.

I'd like to offer another operating paradigm for the list, leave all the
marketing bullshit elsewhere.
