It simply means survival of the fittest.

We were talking about a site that has to be closed because of (new)
crypto laws, not technically down which is seldom with modern hardware.
And also you said that money is no problem!

Why you care so much about people who voluteer to run sites? They
certainly know what kind of risks that they probably face, financial
or otherwise. Do you care your neighbour who opens up a new company
and do you feel unconditionally have to give him advices?? Are you 
the one who is cleverer than all the others?

Then why did you tell me previously that the finacial problem is
nothing?? Any cite connected to the internet is certainly available
everywhere as long as the machine is up.

Remember the assumption is that a site is in a country which has
yet have no crypto laws. It then runs till that country poses
crypto laws. So you can exclude your example. If a country turns
out to be unstable than the effect is that we have one site less
from that time point. If there are plenty of sites, what problem
do you see??

If you want to discuss ethics and morality then you should better
switch to other groups where there are more people who like to hear
you.
