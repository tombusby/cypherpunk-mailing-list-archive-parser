Many of the people are in that situation. Most people don't vote for two
reasons:

1.	It won't significantly effect their lives one way or the other

2.	They don't have time, or at least don't believe they have time.

Yeah, why? (hint: see 1.)

Then Terry Pratchet is an idiot. People don't want it to stay the same, they
want it to get better. They want more money, a bigger house, better clothes,
a cooler car, etc.

If you and Terry seriously don't believe folks understand democracy (though
they may not act the way you want them to in expressing it) then you should
spend some time talking to people and askign them how much they would take
to get rid of the Constitution, allow cops to wander through their homes at
will, etc.

You're both in for a very rude surprise.

True, though I'd say the reason that we don't have a more diverse political
venue is because we don't have proportional seating in the various houses.
That was a fundamental fault with the founding fathers, they misunderstood
the homogeneity of peoples view. Of course they didn't have a clue about
television and such causing a global homogeniety. But then again, that is our
cross to bear in living up to 'a more perfect union'.

The one unifying aspect that amazes me about many of you folks on this
mailing list is your complete lack of understanding of your own duty and
responsibilities in this government. You bitch and bitch and yammer about
what's wrong but you have no desire to fix it, your so focused on initiating
violence it's pathetic. When the Constitutuion was written the job was just
begun, it wasn't finished as you seem to imply.
