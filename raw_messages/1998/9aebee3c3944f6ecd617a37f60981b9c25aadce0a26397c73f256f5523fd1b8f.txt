          The Digital Commerce Society of Boston

                       Presents

                     Mary Ellen Zurko

                    Security Architect,
                     Iris Associates

             "Oh Jonah, He lived in a whale",

                          or,

           How IBM decided to win in ecommerce
        by embracing standards and donating code

                Tuesday, December 1st, 1998
                       12 - 2 PM
             The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
               One Federal Street, Boston, MA


IBM was faced with the question a year ago of how to move from a slow
starter to a leader in security infrastructure for ecommerce. Our
traditional response to that sort of question had been "Hey kids, let's buy
a company!" However, innovative internal forces recognized the power of
the current standards and open source movements. We targeted the IETF PKIX
standards as the most likely to move ecommerce forward, hired a team of
experts in security and PKI and situated them in MA, drafted existing IBM
experts in CDSA and smart cards, put together the first cross
IBM/Lotus/Iris team and the first group with a charter to write freeware,
and delivered the initial code drop to the MIT web site hosting it in
September. The team and the freeware are called Jonah. This talk will cover
the background, current status, and future of the Jonah effort.

Mary Ellen Zurko is Security Architect at Iris, the folks who brought you
Lotus Notes. She previously worked at The Open Group. She spent the four
years before Jonah leading research in innovative and usable distributed
authorization solutions, which posited the solution of the distributed
authentication problem. Her current work on public key authentication and
infrastructures is karmic revenge for such hubris. She has published papers
in user centered security, roles based access control, WWW security and
high assurance operating systems. She is an organizer of the New Security
Paradigms Workshops and a member of the IW3C2, which runs the international
WWW conferences.


This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held on
Tuesday, December 1, 1998, from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of
the Harvard Club of Boston, on One Federal Street. The price for lunch
is $32.50. This price includes lunch, room rental, various A/V hardware,
and the speaker's lunch. ;-).  The Harvard Club *does* have dress code:
jackets and ties for men (and no sneakers or jeans), and "appropriate
business attire" (whatever that means), for women.  Fair warning: since
we purchase these luncheons in advance, we will be unable to refund the
price of your lunch if the Club finds you in violation of the dress
code.


We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or, if we
*really* know you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of
Boston", by Saturday, November 28th, or you won't be on the list for
lunch.  Checks payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston
will have to be sent back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The
Harvard Club of Boston", in the amount of $32.50. Please include your
e-mail address, so that we can send you a confirmation

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements
(We've had to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for
instance), please let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work
something out.


Upcoming speakers for DCSB are:

January    Ira Heffan     Internet Software and Business Process Patents
February   Roland Mueller European Privacy Directive

We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston
on the first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a
presentation to the Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program
Commmittee, care of Robert Hettinga, <mailto: rah@shipwright.com>.
