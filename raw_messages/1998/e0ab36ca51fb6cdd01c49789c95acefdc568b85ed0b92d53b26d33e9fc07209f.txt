So what do you need, E-mail, web space, shell?

We don't do shit until we get a subpoena, then those darned logs on the NT
server
well they just seemed to have corrupted themselves.

Course, this is NOT a invite to hack and fuck around with networks.  I'll
support objectionable content, not pricks.  No advocating violence against
people.

We host several of the white power sites referred to, we also host several
leftist political sites.
Right to freedom of the press goes beyond the government.  If private
business doesn't support freedom of the press, then there is no real freedom.

If any of you need accounts.  Drop a note.
