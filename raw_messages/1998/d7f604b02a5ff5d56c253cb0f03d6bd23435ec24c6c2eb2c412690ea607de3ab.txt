> Printz v. US ruled that  '[t]he Federal Government may neither issue =

> In New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992)  the Supreme Court =

> cannot circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the State's officers =

> Government may neither issue directives requiring the States to address =
> particular problems, nor command the States' officers, or those of their =
> political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory =

> "Although Congress has regulated the disclosure of personal information =
> by some private parties, the Constitution permits Congress to regulate =
> the conduct of individuals. In contrast, Congress may not, as a general =
> matter, regulate the conduct of the States. See New York, 505 U.S. at =

> Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States." (quoted with =
> approval in Printz, 117 S. Ct. at 2377)). "

> Congress's power to enact legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment is =

> 2157, 2171 (1997) (holding that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is =
> "a considerable congressional intrusion into the States' traditional =
> prerogatives," and that Congress exceeded its power under the Fourteenth =
> Amendment in enacting the statute); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, =

> all principles of federalism"); Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 128 =

> is, it is not unlimited"). For instance, Congress's power "extends only =

> Boerne, 117 S. Ct. at 2164 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks =
> omitted). Of perhaps equal importance, it is only a preventative or =
> remedial power, not a substantive power. See id. at 2167. As a result, =
> Congress does not possess "the power to determine what constitutes a =
> constitutional violation." Id. at 2164.=20
