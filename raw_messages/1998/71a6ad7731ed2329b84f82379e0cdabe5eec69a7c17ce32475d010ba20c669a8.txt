As if steganography was new.

Using steganoraphic techniques on low-level elements of
network communication (packets) was considered many years ago
in this very forum.  A particular suggestion seemed much more
effective than Rivest's proposal.  It aim was to hide
information among seemingly innocuous communication.  Whereas,
it is obvious to any observer of a "chaffing" exchange that
an abnormal exchange was taking place.

Of course, if all communication was "chaffed" then that same
exchange would seem perfectly ordinary.  However, the chaffing
technique (creating "bogus" packets, transmitting them along
with the real information, and seperating the two) creates
a lot of overhead... which may not use much bandwidth if
used occasionally, but would create a serious problem if
everyone did it all the time.

The earlier suggestion was to hide information in unused, least
significant, portions of the packet _header_, leaving the data
portion intact.  Thus, the overhead of creating "bogus" packets
is eliminated, the bandwidth used in sending them is conserved,
and the processing power used in seperating the "wheat" from the
"chaff" is freed.

Further, by all accounts, the data transmitted would seem
perfectly ordinary to an eavesdropper.  It could be a poem or
a picture.  However, it would be completely irrelevant, as
the real message is hidden in the header.

Finally, there are the more traditional steganographic techniques
such as using the least significant bits of gifs, jpegs, and wavs.
And, most intriguing of all, mimic functions.
