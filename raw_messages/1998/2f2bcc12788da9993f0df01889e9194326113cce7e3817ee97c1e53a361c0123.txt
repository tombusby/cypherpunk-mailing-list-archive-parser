                            Presents

                       Donald Eastlake 3rd
                         Cybercash, Inc.

                The Internet Open Trading Protocol

                      Tuesday, May 5, 1997
                             12 - 2 PM
                 The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
                   One Federal Street, Boston, MA




The Internet Open Trading Protocol provides an interoperable
framework for Internet commerce.  It is payment system independent
and will be able to encapsulate payment systems such as SET, Mondex,
CyberCash, DigiCash, GeldKarte, etc.  IOTP is able to handle cases
where such roles as the merchant, the payment handler, the
deliverer of goods or services, and the provider of customer support
are performed by different parties or by one party.  See
<http://www.otp.org>.

Donald Eastlake 3rd is a Principal Systems Engineer at CyberCash, Inc.
before which he was in the Pathworks network group at Digital Equipment
Corporation.  At CyberCash, he helped design the "CyberCash message format"
documented in RFC 2898 and implemented the library routines that support
them. He also architected and did the preliminary implementation of
CyberCash's SET implementation.  He is active in IETF standards efforts and
is currently the document editor for the IETF DNS security working group
including RFCs 2065 and 2137.


[Moderator's note: Unfortunately, Jeremey Barrett of BlueMoney,
the speaker originally scheduled for May, found himself unable
do so this month. We are in the process of rescheduling his
talk on digital bearer settlement for a later date. Our
apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.

The DCSB Program Committee thanks Mr. Eastlake for coming
forward on such short notice with such a splendid replacement
topic.]



This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held on
Tuesday, May 5, 1997, from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of the
Harvard Club of Boston, on One Federal Street. The price for lunch is
$32.50. This price includes lunch, room rental, various A/V hardware, and
the speaker's lunch. ;-).  The Harvard Club *does* have dress code: jackets
and ties for men (and no sneakers or jeans), and "appropriate business
attire" (whatever that means), for women.  Fair warning: since we purchase
these luncheons in advance, we will be unable to refund the price of your
lunch if the Club finds you in violation of the dress code.

We will attempt to record this meeting and put it on the web in RealAudio
format at some future date

We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or, if we *really*
know you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by
Saturday, May 2nd, or you won't be on the list for lunch.  Checks
payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will have to be
sent back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The Harvard
Club of Boston", in the amount of $32.50. Please include your e-mail
address, so that we can send you a confirmation

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've
had to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for instance),
please let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something
out.

Upcoming speakers for DCSB are:

June      Michael Baum        PKI Requirements from a
                               Commercial CA's Perspective
July      Rodney Thayer       IPSEC and Digital Commerce
TBA       Jeremey Barrett     Digital Bearer Settlement


We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on
the first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a
presentation to the Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program
Commmittee, care of Robert Hettinga, <mailto: rah@shipwright.com> .
