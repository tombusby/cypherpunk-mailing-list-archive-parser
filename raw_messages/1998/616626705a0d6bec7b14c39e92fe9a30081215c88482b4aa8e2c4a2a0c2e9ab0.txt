Ok, now I understand what you where talking about. Sorry, this was just a very
silly language misunderstanding (my knowledge of CRTs is based on
German vocabulary, so I mixed up "screen grid" and "mask" and was surprised
to read that you seemed to claim that the per-pixel on-off modulation
that van Eck described for his old-style terminals in fig 8c of his
C&S paper is still there in the form of current interruptions caused
by mask holes ... I hope you can understand my surprise ... ;-).
Forget everything I wrote about "screen grid modulation" in my last
reply, I fully agreed with you here.

But this is not necessarily, where the the monitor resonates nicely.
Van Eck has reported very similar results in his paper: His VDU
had a dot clock of 11 MHz and he got nice resonance peaks near 125
and 210 MHz.

If you have only a van Eck style receiver, yes. But as soon as you record
the reception over some time and observe the images phases to drift only
slightly against each other, you might be able to separate them using
similar processing techniques as used in computer tomography.
