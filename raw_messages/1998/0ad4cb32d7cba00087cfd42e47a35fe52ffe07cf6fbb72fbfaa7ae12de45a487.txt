None of the references that I've looked at state it clearly but I assume
that it must be or else we could just use 1 for everything.

Sure it can, 1 + 3 + 7. It can't be the PRODUCT of two lower primes since
it wouldn't be prime then. This sum by the way CAN'T be reduced to two primes
so Fermat's Conjecture applied to odds is clearly false.

The only proviso is the number we want to sum TO must be greater than 2.

ALL numbers can be represented as sums of primes, the question is whether
you allow repeats or not.

In the number theory realm, I agree. In the geometric real (in particular
using equilateral triangles) those constraints hold.

Note that the smallest number of sums for your example above is odd. The
reason that you must exclude the problem becomes trivial if you aren't
required to sum the 1's.

No kidding?

Actualy they are simply sums of 1's, its actualy first grade math.
