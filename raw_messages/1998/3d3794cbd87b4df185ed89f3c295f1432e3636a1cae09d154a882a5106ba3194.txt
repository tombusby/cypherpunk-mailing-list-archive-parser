cypherpunks-announce@toad.com - announcements only.
coderpunks-request@toad.com - code-related issues
cryptography-request@c2.net - Perry Metzger's relatively low-noise list
FCPUNX - Ray Arachelian's filtered list - about 10% of cypherpunks
cypherpunks-lite - Eric Blossom's filtered list - $20/year.
cypherpunks-j@htp.org (I think that's where it is.) In Japanese.
various topical lists, like remailer-operators and ietf-open-pgp
alt.cypherpunks, if it's not moribund yet.
sci.crypt - for more technical, usually less political noise
sci.crypt.research  - low-volume  technical
				Thanks!
