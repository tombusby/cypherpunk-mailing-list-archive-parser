An NBC reporter in Baghdad reported that the Iranian embassy was hit by a
Tomahawk, but I've had the news off since then and haven't heard anything
else about it. The Klinton White House won't come out and admit that they
missed, just like they won't admit that a Tomahawk landed in someone's
house last night (again according to NBC).

You are wrong, though. Comrade Klinton is worse than Comrade Hyde and the
rest. The loyal card-carrying Party members in congress are limited in power
because the majority of them have to agree on an issue. Comrade Klinton can
do virtually whatever he wants with the military under the War Powers Act
and doesn't have to answer for it until it's all over.

As I recall, the name "Desert Fox" was a nickname held by a Nazi general.
Fitting, that.
