Good.  No reason to tempt the Big Brother types (and wannabes).
BTW, people outside the remailer operator and user community seem to
assume that logs ARE kept.  I'm curious to know how often
individuals, organizations, and maybe even governments make requests
for your logs.

Oh ... also, if you don't mind, can you uuencode your /dev/null and
send it to me? <g>

Is that default reordering pool size the same for Type I and Type II
messages?

Perhaps someone can double-check my math on this.  Assuming
equally-sized messages that are otherwise indistinguishable, and a
reordering pool size of five, then the odds of matching up an
encrypted incoming message with an encrypted outgoing message are
one in five.

Thus a message chained through n remailers (each having a reordering
pool size of 5) would be diffused among 5^n possible messages to
thwart potential traffic analysis.

What I'm unclear on is how setting a Latency:  flag affects the
diffusion of the output.  Is that lattency IN ADDITION to the pool
size of five, or does Latency:  +00:00 bypass the reordering process
altogether?

My main concern is the security of chained reply blocks which are
more vulnerable to attack than normal anonymous messages.  A single
anonymous message can only be traced BACKWARDS after it's been
received.  An anonymous reply, OTOH, could, theoretically, be
"walked" through each remailer in the chain until the identity of
the recipient was discovered.  While that process would require
convincing each remailer operator in the chain to cooperate, it's a
lot more feasible than tracing a message backwards to its source.
(Yes, I know about posting to a public message pool, such as a.a.m,
but NG posting seems to be rather unreliable lately.)
