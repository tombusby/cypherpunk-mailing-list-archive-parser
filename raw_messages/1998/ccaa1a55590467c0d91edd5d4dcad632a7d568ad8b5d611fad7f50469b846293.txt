Keep in mind that Timothy McVeigh thought he had anonymity with his
use of a prepaid 'anonymous' phone card over public payphones. He was
wrong. The testimony in this regard at McVeigh's trial was 'fixed'--not
in the 'facts' of tracing his identity, but in the 'timing' of tracing
his identity. i.e. - It was made to appear to be a longer and more
difficult process than it truly was.
It is highly unlikely that electronically-based 'anonymous' technology
is going to be any more untracable than meatspace-disseminated tools
of anonymity.
