P.S.: Last, but not least: Don't get fooled by cheap imitators, I saw what they deliver, and it is just not worth the paper it was printed on, at some back yard printer shop in Guatemala City! Stay with the person whom you can trust if it comes to passports, I know the ropes of this business better than anybody else!
