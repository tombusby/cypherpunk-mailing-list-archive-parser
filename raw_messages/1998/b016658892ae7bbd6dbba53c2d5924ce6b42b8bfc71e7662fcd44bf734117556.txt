SUPER MILEAGE OFFER
 Take Advantage of TWA's New Website
 
 As a frequent traveler, you're constantly on
 the go.  So we've made it easy to access your
 Aviators portfolio information via the Internet.
 Just point your web browser at the all-new TWA
 website(http://www.twa.com), select "Frequent 
 Traveler Information", and provide your Aviators 
 portfolio number when prompted.  You can check 
 your portfolio balance, verify mileage credit, 
 and more.
 
 To celebrate our new website, when you use Trans 
 World Access, TWA's online booking system, to 
 book and travel on or before December 31, 1998,
 you'll earn bonus miles for your round-trip 
 flights.  With each round-trip flight, you'll
 earn an even bigger bonus - up to 15,000 miles in all!
 
 1st Flight - 1,000 miles
 2nd Flight - 2,000 miles
 3rd Flight - 4,000 miles
 4th Flight - 8,000 miles
 
 And these bonuses are in addition to all other mileage -
 actual miles flown, privilege-level bonus and class-of-
