	I'm not advocating "ready-made" arguments.  Rather, I'm 
	suggesting that we get rid of an *analogy*.  An analogy isn't
	the truth.  In this case, it's a way to frame the truth 
	for non-technical people.  Dropping an analogy is subtracting
	BS, not adding it.

	Now, I'm not saying analogies are evil, but the analogy
	to firearms is a *bad* one, and it stands to give people
	the misconception that crypto is many things that it is 
	not (not to mention including <stigma.h>).

	If you want to analogize crypto to something, analogize
	it to something crypto is more like.

	Well, after all, once we perfect the neural interface, we _will_ 
	all become munitions.

	You can't fight fear unless you remove some misconceptions.
	The association with firearms (which is in turn associated
	by the gov't to baaad things) is only going to cause 
	misconceptions in the public arena.

	This is, IMHO, the wrong way to remove the fear caused by
	the crypto-firearm analogy.  The right way is to drop the 
	analogy, because it's flawed.  I agree that people should
	be less afraid of guns, but you just don't have TIME to cure
	that, if you can at all.

	..As will the phrase, "cryptography is like a gun...."  Joe User
	won't see authentication as "like a gun" any more than his telephone
	is "like a gun."

	?!!?!!!

	The phase, "now, bad guys can use this to kill you just like 
	a gun, but responsible law-abiding citizens can use it too"
	is true for ALL solid objects larger than a breadbox.  You
	do NOT say this, however, when selling someone a halogen lamp
	or a Tickle-me-Elmo doll, or introducing them to anything
	new that they should have at home.  This doesn't make you a 
	liar.

	It is chillingly naive to defend an argument on the grounds
	that when dissected logically it is a true statement.  
	Do you approve of the government repeatedly warning people that 
	"crypto can be used by terrorists!"  It is, after all, a true 
	statement!  How about the next time you walk through airport 
	security you say, "I could have concealed explosives in my pants."  
	True statement, and you're not in the business of lying.  Would you 
	consider yourself less honest for not saying it?

	See, whatever the truth value of the statement, the end
	result is the suggestion of a lie.

	Dropping a flawed analogy isn't covering the truth.  Rather,
	keeping the analogy distorts the truth.  It scares and 
	alienates people and makes them think cryptography is this
	weird stuff they'll never personally use which is less
	like a PIN number on steroids and more like plastique.
	And this is the last thing we need.
