Hi Steve,

Can I forward your questions to another technology list I support as well as
the local high performance rocketry group I'm involved in? I believe
they would be intriqued by your questions.

As I understand the process you don't get around the speed-of-light issue
because the control channel still needs to be sent via radio or laser or
whatever. This was discussed in the in the original teleportation
announcement. However, I don't see anything that would keep you from syncing
two atomic clocks and then using them to make the changes in sync, this
should allow the imposition of the speed of light only on initiation and
occassion syncronization. I'll have to beg ignorance on specifics as I
haven't had the time to really dig into specifics. I haven't even read the
primary references to date.

Agreed. It would also solve many terrestrial problems as well.

True, but it would be boring compared to being there first person. I do
support robot exploration as a precursor to manned exploration.

>From what little I have delved into this, most signals coming in from 'out
there' as well as from satellites are circularly polarized. This is the
reason that the antennas have those curly-ques on them (look like a
cork-screw sorta). The last time I even messed with extra-terrestrial
signals was the SL-9 impacts. I worked with several amateur groups using plane
(flat rectangular) loop antennas to measure the increase in the background
noise in various bands (we used a HP spectrum analyzer at my site) during
the impacts. What we saw was a 'jump' across the band of several db's just
at the time-of-flight times we expected. The assumption being this was
caused by the impacts. We monitored 1MHz to 10MHz. I found it pretty
impressive. We got, if memory serves, around 6 of the large impacts.

I'll have to disagree, all forms of E-M radiation that I am aware of are
polarized to some frame of reference. The E-M fields after all are
orthogonal. The question is which field you want to pick as a reference
and the relationship of source to sensor. Circularly polarized (ie the
fields rotate around the axis of transmission at some rate) are about the
only sort that would appear essentialy the same irrespective of reference
frame.
