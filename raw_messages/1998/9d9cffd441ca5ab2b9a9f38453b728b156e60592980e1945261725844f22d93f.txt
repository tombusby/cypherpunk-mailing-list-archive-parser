NOTE the word "harmful" below, used three times, mainly meaning
"harmful competition by offering lower tax rates".

Now, this is very interesting, if unsurprising. Theoretically, there is no 
particular reason why competition in tax rates, i.e. essentially in the 
provision of government services at a lower price, should be "harmful" in 
any sense differing from competition in supplying any other service.


Naturally, the supplier of a particular service (or product) tends to think 
of competition in his own arena as "harmful", whereas competition in any
other is generally a "public good". This is obviously nothing but self-
serving;
the putative robber barons of the last century presumably thought of 
competiton in petroleum, rail transportation and whatnot as "harmful", as did
United and American when airline service opened to competition some
20 years ago.

What makes the assertions of the British and other G7 governments 
particularly irksome is that they simultanaeously advocate competition
in most areas, except their own, and at the same time make a 
- usually implicit - claim to represent some kind of public good, and 
a claim to holding the moral high ground.
