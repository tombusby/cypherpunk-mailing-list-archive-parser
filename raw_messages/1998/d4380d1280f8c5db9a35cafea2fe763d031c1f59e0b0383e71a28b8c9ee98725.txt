According to the website, there's no pool of passwords.  There's a
truncated hash that will catch most mistakes, but is useless as a test
criterion in a dictionary attack.  If you get the user's "public" key,
then you can do a dictionary attack.  The user's "public" key isn't
public, however; not even the user knows it.  If I'm understanding it
right, it's stored encrypted and the key is only given to a set of
predefined servers.  Prior relationship must exist; they admit that.
