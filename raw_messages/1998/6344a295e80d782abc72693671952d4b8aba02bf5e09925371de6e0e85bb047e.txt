But how can you plausibly threaten the power of he who has the most
power?  That would imply that a greater power exists -if so, how do we
control those who wield *it*?  Checks and balances don't work if those
in power aren't willing to check others in power (because, for example,
they're on the same side).

So?  As long as he doesn't initiate force against anyone, I see no
reason why he should be physically prevented from doing what he does.  I
dislike the way he operates, but neither I nor anyone else has the right
to initiate force upon him to stop him, so long as he doesn't initiate
force himself.

My solution to the problematic behavior of Mr. Gates is not to patronize
him wherever possible, to within a certain level of convienience.  For
example, I do not run MS software on my system --it sucks compared to
Linux.

Other people hate microsoft even more, and actively work against it. 
These people either work for competing companies, agitate the public to
shun microsoft, or write good open source software, in an attempt to
remove microsoft's market.

How?  What rights have been violated?  Did he at any time initiate force
against any of these workers?  Did he hire soldiers to storm into
competitors' offices to murder and destroy everyone and everything?  If
he has, I certainly haven't heard of it.

I suspect that any "rights" which you think have been "violated" turn
out to be non-rights, if you're anything other than a socialist.  (which
you may very well be  --in which case, you'd be irrational and very good
at doublethink, making intelligent argument futile)

I do not agree with this appraisal, and do not care, as long as he
doesn't initate force, or use the state to initate force.  Until then,
he has as much right to do what he does as you have to do whatever it is
that you do.

But my point all along is that anyone who takes a gun and tries to take
something *is* likely to face retribution --either from those he steals
from, or from others who don't wish to be robbed by him.  This
retribution can take many forms, ranging from death, to ostracism, to a
lowering of his reputation, depending upon how severe his crime was.

You just haven't been reading what I've been saying, have you?

Such events would be rare, since it's pretty easy for all parties
concerned to figure out the likely result of such an exchange.  Mr.
would-be-warlord will probably not act on his desires, since he knows
that it would at best drop his reputation through the floor, and at
worst, result in his death.

Unless of course, he's a real lunatic  -in which case, he'd have gone
out and attacked someone anyway.  It's actually better this way.  At
least we don't have to worry about intelligent would-be-warlords
manipulating the state to do their dirty work for them. 

In sum, the possibility of getting killed tends to put a damper on the
would-be-warlord population.

Ok, then think of it this way.  Instead of having one big, centralized
state, where orders are given from on high, and are thus frequently
inequitous to lowly individuals, let's go for a more evenly distributed
model.  Let's carry this distribution to the point where everyone
governs himself and his property.

Previous attempts at such things would have failed, since humaity lacked
communications systems which were fast enough to link such a system
together.  
Previous forms of government all reflect this fact.  Communication was
always very centralized, and thus governance had to be as well, to keep
everyone up to speed on what's going on.  As communications technologies
improved, states have become more and more decentralized.  (go from the
mesopotamian warrior-kings, to Rome, to monarchy, to parliamentary
government, to the US).  

And today, we are presented with the internet --the ultimate in
decentralized, near instantaneous communications.  We aren't very far
from making it possible for anyone, anywhere, to communicate with anyone
else, wherever they may be.  Obviously, this makes it possible to
progress even further by decentralizing things even more!

The net result is indistinguishable from anarcho-capitalism.  I'd be
satisfied with it.  Do you like it better from this angle?

No, but you couldn't have cited the United States before it existed

Nope, it's based on *reality*.  The only way to ensure that no one will
inflict violence upon you is to be capable of inflicting at least as
much violence upon any attacker.  What I'm telling you is that if the
above conditions exist, violence will become a very unhealthy trade, and
will not be practiced by anyone aside from the occasional lunatic who
wants to commit suicide in an interesting fashion. 

> You lose! Consistently wrong
> answers. You just don't get it.

I beg to differ.  It would appear that *you* just don't get it.  Re-read
what I've said in the light of my above paragraph, and see if you come
to the same conclusion.

> War does not produce wide spread economic
> growth in those zones affected by the war. It destroys the infrastructure

I agree that war destroys infrastructure, and is not going to cause
widespread economic growth.  I never said otherwise.  But lets look at
war for a moment, hmm?

Those who start wars usually do so because they think they can win them,
am I correct?  It would be insane to do otherwise.  If conditions were
such that nobody could be sure of winning, there would be very little
incentive to start a war, don't you agree?

Of course, in reality, wars are started between nations by their
leaders, who supposedly act on the behalf of their people.  It is
currently possible for the leader of a nation to have an incentive to
start a war which his country cannot win, so long as *he* profits by it 
-in terms of money, power, etc.  As long as he doesn't lose personally,
he can do whatever he likes (if he's sufficiently amoral, which we must
assume that some leaders will be).  

This is not the same on an individual level, however.  It is never in
the interest of the attacker to attack someone unless he can be
reasonably sure of winning.  The attacker cannot divorce himself from
the results of his actions, as the leader of a nation can, because he
cannot separate his being from his body in any effective sense.  That
is, if his body loses the fight, he's screwed.

The point you raise would seem to be yet another argument for
anarcho-capitalism.  It would appear that preople have even more
incentive not to hurt each other under those conditions than under
present ones.

> that only an organized government is capable of maintaining.

This is untrue.  Organized government is not necessary for the
maintenence of infrastructure.  See my other posts, or "The Market for
Liberty".

It is an impossible task, as my discussions with Jim Choate have shown.

I've offered plenty of validation.  You haven't bothered trying to
invalidate these validations, which would be the only way you could
logically disprove my arguement.  Instead, you've deliberately or
unconsciously misunderstood or misread my arguements until they fit in
with what you wanted me to have said.  At which point, you spewed forth
whatever canned response you had ready for what you wished I'd said.

You would be correct.  I like to count myself among them.  I have no
desire to hurt or be hurt, rule or be ruled.

100% correct.

Incorrect, for the above reasons.

We don't really disagree on the fundamentals.  I suggest that you take a
very close and unbiased look at the points where we seem to disagree.  I
suspect that upon closer examination, you will come to the same
conclusions that I have.  It all hinges on being able to think about
*why* the state might be the only possible solution to various
problems/required services.  This is usually very difficult for most
people, as they've had those beliefs drilled into their skulls since
they were young.  I've found that it's much like a religion, in some
respects.  At least, all the arguments I've ever had with religious
people on the topic of their religion kept ending up much like our
current discussion).  I've since realized how pointless it is to have
such religious arguments.  I haven't given up on politial arguments,
however, and I hope I never have to.  The result is unpleasant to think
about.

Good luck, and watch out for doublethink!
