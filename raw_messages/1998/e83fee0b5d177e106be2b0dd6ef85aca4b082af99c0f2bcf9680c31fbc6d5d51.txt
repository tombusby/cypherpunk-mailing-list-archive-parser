Um, actualy not. It is actualy illegal for me to allow you to borrow my
books, CD's, albums, etc.

They own it. The employees are acting as agents of the employer and
therefore the employer, not the employee, is the owner of that traffic. So
if you send an email to some mailing list on the clock or with their
equipment then the traffic wasn't ever yours. The owner of a copyright can
make as many copies as they choose. The question is what do they do with the
email that comes from the other person using the other employers computer to
send the traffic....

As far as I know this hasn't made it into court in this exact form, however
it isn't likely too either. The precedences, and reasoning behind, the above
interpretation is well known and understood (at least by lawyers).

What is the bill number for this?

Not viewing it since the act of putting the data on the server is an implied
permission to view. However, the instant you make a permanent copy on your
hard-drive, that's not in the browsers short term cache, would be illegal.
