                                     LEOPOLDSKRON

The most unique venue of its kind, situated in Salzburg - Austria, 
the very heart of Europe, welcomes you. 

The palace was built in 1740 as a summer residence for the 
Archbishop Leopold Firmian, and purchased by Max Reinhardt, 
the renowned theater director and co-founder of the Salzburg 
Festival, in 1918. When it was featured in the film "The Sound 
of Music", SCHLOSS LEOPOLDSKRON became famous 
throughout the world.

Today, the magnificent historic ambiance and its up-to-date 
infrastructure make SCHLOSS LEOPOLDSKRON an ideal site 
for residential conferences and seminars, and a particularly 
attractive destination for incentive and special interest group 
travelers visiting Mozart's place of birth.  

On request, we put together for you suitable incentive packages 
that include on- and off-site activities, such as visits to the 
Salzburger Festival or other cutural events, a day-trip to the lake 
district, a concert or a gala diner at the palace, for instance.
