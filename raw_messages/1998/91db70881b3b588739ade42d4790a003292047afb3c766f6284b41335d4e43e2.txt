Hey, if you're a BeOS developer (and you can become one for free,) United 
Micro will give you a discount on a dual PII-266 system w/ 128 Megs.  I 
have just such a beast, and it ain't bad.  SMP rocks.  Haven't tried to 
put Windows on it, though.

	Well sir, there's about 4 FAQs there, one of which is in
	10 parts.  What do you want?

	There's the Cryptography FAQ (the big one), the snake-oil
	FAQ, the RSA-Cryptography-today FAQ, and the SSL talk list
	FAQ.  The 10 parts of the big one:

		Overview		Public-key Cryptography
		Net Etiquette		Digital Signatures
		Basic Cryptology	Technical Miscellany
		Mathematical Cryptology	Other Miscellany
		Product Ciphers		References

	They range in size from 1-20 k, and ~100 k for the whole
	thing.
