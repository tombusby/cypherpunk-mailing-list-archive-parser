 Some of this reminds me of when I worked at Raytheon, I did some coding
for this genius at magnetic fields we had. This was the time of the MX
missile and the 'racetrack' concept, mobile launchers that moved all the
time. The idea was that a significiant percentage of the mobile launch
cannisters were empty and what the scientist I worked with had to do was
design a set of coils for the dummy cannister that would make it have
the same magnetic signature as a real cannister loaded with a real
missile ... "sort of a global thermonuclear shell game" if you will ...
