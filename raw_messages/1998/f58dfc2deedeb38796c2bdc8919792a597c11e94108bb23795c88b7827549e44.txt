Credit card transactions over the Net are new, but
not overly different.

We know how to do credit card transactions where there
is no physical card: over the pohne.  And we know how to
establish a secure merchant-customer session: via SSL.
SET is a complicated, server-intensive protocol, and I have trouble
believing
 its possible to implement a two-inch-thick standard without security bugs.
 I'm not surprised merchants are so slow in acepting it.  Why bother?
