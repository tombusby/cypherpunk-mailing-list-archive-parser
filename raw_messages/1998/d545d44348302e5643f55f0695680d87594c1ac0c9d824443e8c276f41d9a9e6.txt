You clearly don't run a website. Logs are very valuable. Any admin
who doesn't have space for at least several days of normal traffic
available on their logging device is simply not doing a good job.
A network admin running a website doesn't lose logs - careers live
and die on them (if this seems an overstatement to you, go look at
http://www.abcinteractiveaudits.com/ and report your findings.
-10 points for declaring it stupid.).

If you didn't mean "fill up the target's logs" (which I took to mean
overflow available disk space), but rather "pepper the logs with
many instances of some sort of odd political commentary", that could
have an effect. It could throw off reporting and make a new conversation
topic for editors, which might, if you managed to organize enough
people, earn you a CNET story. "CyberActivists Make An Obtuse
Statement - Click Here For Soundbyte".

Great job.

Truth is, on any major site, you'd need hundreds of robots making
your bogus requests to show up - manually telneting to port 80
is line noise these days to any serious site, unless you're poking
at potential security problems.

If you really want to try this, at least take the bother to make
valid HTTP requests that most servers will recognize. Your example
above should be something like:

GET
/I/dont/support/your/sites/views/on/such/and/such/see/www.stop.this.now.org/
for/details HTTP/1.0

(note the two newlines at the end of the request)
