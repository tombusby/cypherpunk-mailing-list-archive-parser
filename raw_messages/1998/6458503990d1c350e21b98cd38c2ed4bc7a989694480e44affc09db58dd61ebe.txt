For those of you fellas who still have the OLD excel 95 (not office 97),
try this out :


1. open a new file

2. scroll down until you see row 95

3. click on the row 95 button, this highlights the whole row

4. press tab, to move to the second column

5. now, move your mouse and click on help THEN about Microsoft excel

6. press ctrl-alt-shift and click on the tech support button simultaneously

7. A WINDOW WILL APPEAR, TITLE : THE HALL OF TORTURED SOULS

   This is really eerie okay...it has a doom style format and you can
walk all around the hall...and on the sides of the walls are the names
of the tortured souls...


8. NOW WALK UP THE STAIRS AND THEN COME BACK DOWN, FACE THE BLANK WALK
AND THEN TYPE IN EXCELKFA this will open the blank wall to reveal
another secret passage, walk through the passage and DO NOT fall off,
when you get to the end, you will see something really really eerie...

At this point in time, countless witnesses all over the world have
verified this point...it's really an eye opener. It could be a joke by
MS programmers ,or is it?


Wouldn't be surprised if Bill Gates was "The Antichrist", after all
it,was already foretold in the Bible that someone powerful would rise
up and lead the world to destruction.  And Bill Gates definitely have
that kind of power in his hands. More than 80% of the world's
computers run on Windows and DOS (including those at Pentagon!)  If
all his products have some kind of small program embedded (like this
Hall of Tortured Souls) that can give him control, setting off nuclear
arsenals, creating havoc in security systems, financial systems all
over the world,etc......all from his headquarters isn't a far off
reality! Just using Internet Explorer may just allow him to map out
what you have on your computer bit by bit each time you log on.
Perhaps the end times are near and this is just a tip of the iceberg!?

"He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free
andslave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so
that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the
name of the beast or the number of his name. This calls for wisdom. If
anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it
is man's number. His number is 666 ."    ....Revelation 13:16-18


Something for you to think about.

An eerie E-mail for everybody to think about...

The Bible, in the Book of Revelation says that without the sign of the
beast one would not be able to buy, sell, do business
transactions,etc.....  and

My question to you now is this..... Is Internet now a necessity in
doing business?  The Internet also bears the sign....

Note that the Internet is also commonly known as the World Wide Web or WWW..
...

One other way we write W is V/   (VI), so .....

              W   W   W

              VI  VI  VI

              6   6   6


This gives me something to ponder upon ... Isn't everything going
towards the Internet? (i.e., buying / selling goods, business
transactions) Isn't Microsoft always on the move to have a monopoly
when it comes to software technology? And now the Internet?

Revelation also says that the mark of the beast will be carried on
one's Hand and one's forehead.....If the Internet would indeed be the
sign of the beast aren't we all starting to carry it on our hands and
foreheads???  Screens (forehead) and make use of the mouse (hand) ???

Are things finally falling into place or are we just letting our
imagination run?

Remember, the devil came to cheat, steal, and to destroy......... so
be VIGILANT!!!!  About Bill Gates and Microsoft. PROOF that Bill Gates
is the Devil:

The real name of "the" Bill Gates is William Henry Gates
III. Nowadays, he is known as Bill Gates (III), where III means the
order of third (3rd).

By converting the letters of his current name to the ASCII-values and
adding his (III),you get the following:

      B  66

      I  73

      L  76

      L  76

      G  71

      A  65

      T  84

      E  69

      S  83

      I   1

      I   1

      I   1

  ---------------

        666 !!!!        THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST.......

Some might think ask, "How did Bill Gates get so powerful?"
Coincidence?  Or just the beginning of mankind's ultimate and total
enslavement?

Before you decide, consider the following:

      MS-DOS 6.21

 77+83+45+68+79+83+32+54+46+50+49 = 666

      WINDOWS95

 87+73+78+68+79+87+83+57+53+1= 666

Coincidence?  You decide...."To agree or to not agree with the WWW or
the Beast", is not the question.  What if the WWW is the 666? Or Bill
Gates be the Beast?

What will you do?? Cancel subscriptions to the Internet?  Resign from
Microsoft? Set out a campaign against Bill Gates in the Internet? Shut
down all Windows95 forever?  It will not do you any good.....

Think about all this and pray, pray really hard, or
else......... 
Never Stop Believing....
