That's MEGA-wishful thinking (not to mention more than a tad nuts).

The results of a major nuclear strike would take the human race to a
civilization level more akin to the Sumarians (at best). The ecological,
technological, medical, etc. failures would be impossible to deal with at
our current level of technology.

Potentialy a billion or more people would survive short-term. Nobody in
there right mind would want to trade places with them. Within 20 years the
vast majority of the survivors would be dead. If there would be more than
50M in 60 years over the entire planet I'd be surprised.

If I were setting policy I'd point a bunch/most of my nukes at myself. The
kindest thing I can do for my people is to kill them, the worst thing I
could do for my enemy is leave them alive - they'll eat themselves. Then I'd
sit back and say:

"Fuck with us and we suicide. Oh, we'll take you with us but slowly and by
your own hand."

In the process nuke their major grain belts, water resources, and raw metal
sites, leave their cities and major population centers standing and occupied.

It ain't winnable by either side except by avoidance.
