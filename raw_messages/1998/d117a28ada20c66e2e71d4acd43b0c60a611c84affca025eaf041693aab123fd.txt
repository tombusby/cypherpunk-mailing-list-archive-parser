Data Fellows Secures the World's Largest Computer Demo Event

Assembly '98 Sponsored by F-Secure Data Security Products

Data Fellows, one of the world's leading data security development
companies, is proud to support Assembly '98, the world's largest computer
demo event. Data Fellows will also maintain data security during the
happening. 

Assembly is an annual computer multimedia event, celebrated in Helsinki,
Finland. It gathers amateurs and professionals from all over the world to
meet other demo experts and compete in the art of demo making. A demo binds
thrilling graphics and animations with massive sound effects to form a
multimedia presentation of computer programming. 

Assembly '98 will be held during 7th - 9th of August 1998 and is expecting
3000 visitors. Prizes worth more than $25,000 USD will be awarded.

The F-Secure Anti-Virus product will be used to protect the main file
servers of Assembly '98 against viruses. Copies of the product will also be
distributed to all participants. The F-Secure Network Encryption products
will be used to protect the network traffic of the ad-hoc Assembly network
- which is hooked live to the Internet.

"Protecting a happening like Assembly is certainly a challenge", comments
Data Fellows' Manager of Anti-Virus Research, Mr. Mikko Hypp霵en. "However,
we've been co-operating with Assembly organizers all along since 1993, and
I'm sure of yet another success."

"We do realise that the stereotype of a demo coder and the stereotype of a
virus writer are pretty close to each other - both are often male teenagers
who are experts with low-level programming." Continues Hypp霵en. "That's
why we want to promote a happening like Assembly, which shows these young
people a way to use their programming talents in a safe and productive
way."
