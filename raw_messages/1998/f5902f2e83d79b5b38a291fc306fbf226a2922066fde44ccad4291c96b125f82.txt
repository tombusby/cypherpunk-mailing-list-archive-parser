		MAD MOUNTIE INDIAN TRADING POST
		-------------------------------

	Despite the comparative ease with which members of the law
	enforcement community are able to avoid penalties or legal
	punishment for murdering Wagon-Burners under the cover of
	a government-issued assassins badge, there still remains
	a small minority of policemen who are not comfortable with
	the moral implications of taking another human life lightly,
	but who don't want to suffer the stigmatism of not having
	a human trophy mounted on their office wall.

	This translates into $$$ BIG BUCKS $$$ for those who work
	in mortuaries, or who are lucky enough to hit a Wagon-Burner
	with their vehicle in a remote location where they can pop
	the body into the trunk.
	The Mad Mountie Indian Trading Post will pay top dollar for
	Wagon-Burner carcasses without noticeable tread marks, and
	a special bonus to those who bring in a mother and child
	combination suitable for mounting in the currently popular
	"Dave's Double" configuration.

	Carcasses that bear a significant resemblance to famous
	Wagon-Burners such as Louis Riel, Sitting Bull and
	Geronimo will be sold at the monthly Officers Only Auction.
