If nothing else, Clinton deserves his troubles because he is a very strong
supporter of the legal structures that caused them.

1)  He is a lawyer and a strong supporter of the trial lawyers who have
promoted extremely expansive civil discovery of the sort that allowed
Clinton to be questioned about Monica in the Jones case.

2)  He is a strong advocate of the sort of sexual harassment law that led
to the Jones case.  He thinks it should be punished harshly.  A real feminist.

3)  He is a strong advocate of the Ethics in Government Act and pushed its
renewal through Congress in 1994 when the Act was going to expire and when
the Dems controlled both houses of Congress.

4)  He is a law-and-order liberal who believes in executing retarded
murderers and jailing hospital execs who submit Medicare bills based on
misunderstandings of detailed and contradictory regulations.

5)  His wife (and presumably he) was a strong supporter of an expansive
definition of "high crimes and misdemeanors" during Watergate.

"Hoist on your own petard" (and I even know what a petard is).
