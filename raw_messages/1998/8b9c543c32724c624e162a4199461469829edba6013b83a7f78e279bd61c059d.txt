Might have been 82, find out when ARPA became DARPA and *only* worked on
defense related material. The distinction was one of administration and
not physical changes to anything other than some nameservers and routers.

When the change happened it meant that ARPA could no longer participate
as an equal with the NFS so they split the funding and administrative
servers.
