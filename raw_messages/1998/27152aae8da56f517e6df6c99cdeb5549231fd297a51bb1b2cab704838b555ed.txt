Actualy they killed Bull before he could complete his Super-Gun design and
get it built. There is no point to be had in killing the designer after the
fact except to advertise their accomplishment except to prevent future work
by that person.

This seems to have worked with several of the programmers at The L0pht
(l0pht.com) because of their legal problems. Seems they now do work for the
DoJ and other groups in return the various charges that were pending against
them were dropped (or at least put on hold).

L0phtCrack is one of the major NT cracking/testing tools currently used by
folks. And no, I am not implying it has been compromised only pointing out
that because of the relationship of some of the programmers to law
enforcement it could have been. I am not aware of the exact timing of the
agreement, development, and release of the software.

Then everyone would want proof and if you couldn't produce it they would
simply label you a nutcase. You probably would have mysterious accident
after that sort of behaviour. Besides, even if you were to prove it - could
you trust the witness protection process?

If the agents could infiltrate the development team what keeps them from
mounting a mitm attack on the people doing the signing?
