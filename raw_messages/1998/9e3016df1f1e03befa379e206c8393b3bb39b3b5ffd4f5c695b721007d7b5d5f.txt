It is the duty of all to say "Hey! respect intellectual property!" 
I too am against piracy, now I know that that software i.e statgraphics
is not a shareware. 

Thank you.

  it is OK if you say
    "it is not OK with us if you send warez requests to the list."
  it is not OK if you say ".... fuck yourself"
