This doesn't speak to `reasonable doubt' which was the subject
under discussion.  Or are you arguing that a defense to perjury
is that there is reasonable doubt that a question was material?
Go watch TV and report back with the answer.

Yes, but I assumed Mac had included this under the `abuse of power'
heading since he explicitly cited that topic in his message to which
I was responding, and since that appeared to match one of the broad
headings under which Starr classifies his possible `grounds for
impeachment':

    "...that President Clinton's actions ... have been inconsistent 
    with the President's constitutional duty to faithfully execute 
    the laws. "

I see nowhere that Starr claims that it was illegal/impeachable for
Clinton to have claimed executive privilege.  He merely notes that
Clinton used it (extensively) along with a bunch of other tactics to
delay and impede the investigation.
