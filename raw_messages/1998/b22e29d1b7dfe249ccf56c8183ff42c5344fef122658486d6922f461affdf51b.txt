Which point? Yours, or J.A.'s???
I thought the point wasn't about control of that segment of the oil supply,
I was voicing my personal opinion there. Rather, the point was about the
sanction of a sovereign neighbor nation, and our (The US's) actions in
forcing Hussein back as part of a world community effort. Whether our
"sticking our noses into it" as J.A. said earlier, was justifiable. 

I agree we should be pursuing alternative energies with greater diligence,
I'd like to see what the petroleum companies have on their shelves and are
suppressing.
