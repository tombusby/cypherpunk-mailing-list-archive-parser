Actually, 

there seems to be a screw up out  there.

Right now, one can go down the 7/11, and pay 
cash for a prepaid cellphone, and renew it with 
cellphone time cards also purchased with cash.

No paperwork, NONE.

I have one.

While all of the technology applies, and certainly it is possible
to determine things by analyzing calling habits, I can't see how one
can easily determine who has cellphone #blahblahblahblahblah when 
you just bought a box at an out of town 7/11 during the breakfast
rush with cash.

Esp if one doesn't make a lot of calls.
