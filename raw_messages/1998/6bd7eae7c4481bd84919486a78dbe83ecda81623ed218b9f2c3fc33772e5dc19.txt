Here are my notes

  Thursday December 29, 1994 16:45 File MAD1.TXT 

  Memorandum of Record

  At 16:30 I received a call from a

	Wayne Madsen
	3911 Fairfax Square
	Fairfax, VA 22031
	703-876-3081
	        3065 FAX
	wmadsen@explorer.csc.com

  Wayne told me he had a contract to update the Puzzle Palace
  first written by James Bamford.  The contract is with Penguin-
  Viking.  We talked close to 45 minutes.

  Wayne told he saw my name in Wirbel's EE Times articles.

  I gave Madsen some information about my case and where documents 
  can be obtained in the WDC area.

  Madsen told me two disturbing items:

  1	NSA has been inviting White House staff to NSA.   NSA 
	attempts to impress staff with NSA gadgets.

  2	NSA recently invited Tom Clancy to NSA.  Clancy's next novel
	will be about NSA.  Clancy, Wayne told, me is being used as a 
	PR man to obtain more funding for NSA.  

  Madsen also told me that a CRYPTO-AG salesman also got arrested by the
  Iranians for selling them crypto devices which also sent out the key!
  NSA work: called Red Threads or Hidden Threads.

  But let us be a little suspicious.  NSA is fairly good at dirty
  tricks.

  1	Anyone know Madsen?
  2	Is Madsen for real?

  If Madsen is for real, then let us help him with his book.

A former spook did a drive-by of 

        3911 Fairfax Square
	Fairfax, VA 22031

shortly after the phone call from Madsen

The former spook phoned me  again on 07:29 3/16/1998.

The spook did a technical evaluation of the above address.

How may tricycles, cars, shades pulled-down to see if the address 
was possibly a home address.

The spook concluded that the above address may be a 
business.

Let's all, of course, hope for settlement.
