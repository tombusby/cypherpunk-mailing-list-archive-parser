You sure it's not Microshaft? More meanings.

A little experiment is often a good thing. I heard that the guys who
made the DES cracker have had $$ requests for machines and/or chips.

In case you missed it, my original reply was an attempt to open
discussion on some type of cooperative effort.

Look at http://www.xilinx.com/products/xc4000XLA.html for prototype
purposes. I wonder how many DES or IDEA engines could be put on a 500K
gate array? It would fit about 35 instantiations of Twofish. That should
be enough for a phone or a disk encryptor.

It's not trivial but -
Products can be done. 
On a shoestring. 
By the right people. 
Even non-geniuses.
Who want to get them done. <-- the key item

No sense pushing the button without critical mass.

sigh...
