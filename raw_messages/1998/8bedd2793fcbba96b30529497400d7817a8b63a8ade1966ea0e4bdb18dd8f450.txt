Yes, it's one of the major techniques used by spammers;
the other big one is disposable accounts.
maps.vix.com has information about the Realtime Blackhole List
system, which lets you configure your sendmail system to reject
incoming mail from any system that permits relays,
and provides lots of information about setting your system
not to do relays.  They're a bit inflexible,
but if you're up to rolling your own sendmail.cf code,
you can fix that.
				Thanks!
