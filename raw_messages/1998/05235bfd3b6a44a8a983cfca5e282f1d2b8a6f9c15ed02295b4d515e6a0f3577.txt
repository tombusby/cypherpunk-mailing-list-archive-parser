BELOW IS A SITE WORTH VISITING AND DESERVING OF CAREFUL STUDY, as the US
military has made it clear in its numerous documents, that a considerable
segment of the US population is suspect, and a sizable number are of the
"warrior classes," hence must be contained.  Machiavelli, a shrewd military
strategist, understood well the strategies for keeping the balance of power
and, thus, advised the princes of Renaissance Italy, which at that time
were a collection of powerful city-states, always at war with each other.
Machiavelli's  strategies AND PHILOSOPHIES, have been, still are, the
subject of SERIOUS study by US military strategists.

"He [the prince or any ruler] must, therefore, never raise his thought from
this exercise of war, and in peacetime, he must train himself more than in
time of war; this can be done in two ways: one by action, the other by the
mind.  And as far as actions are concerned, besides keeping his soldiers
well disciplined and trained, he must always be out hunting, and must
accustom his body to hardships in this manner; and HE MUST ALSO LEARN THE
NATURE OF THE TERRAIN, AND KNOW HOW MOUNTAINS SLOPE, HOW VALLEYS OPEN, HOW
PLAINS LIE, AND UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF RIVERS AND SWAMPS; [emphasis ac]
and he should devote much attention to such activities. ... and a Prince
who lacks this ability lacks the most important quality in a leader;
because this skill teaches you to find the enemy, choose a campsite, lead
troops, organize them for battle, and besiege towns to your own advantage."
 .... Therefore, a prince must not worry about the reproach of cruelty when
it is a matter of keeping his subjects united and loyal; ......."  The
Prince, by Machiavelli.
