           EE 579R, ADVANCED TOPICS IN CRYPTOGRAPHY

                       Spring `99 Semester
               WPI, Thursdays, 5:30-8:30pm, AK219
                 First day of class: January 21


                       COURSE DESCRIPTION

The course is a continuation of EE 578/CS 578, Cryptography and Data
Security. It will provide a deeper insight into several areas of cryptology
which are of great practical and theoretical importance. One focus of the
course is on techniques for efficient software and (to a somewhat lesser
extend) hardware implementations for public-key algorithms. The second focus
is on attacks against public-key schemes, which is fundamental for an
in-depth understanding of the choice of practical algorithms. Many techniques
will be introduced which are usually only treated in the research
literature.
