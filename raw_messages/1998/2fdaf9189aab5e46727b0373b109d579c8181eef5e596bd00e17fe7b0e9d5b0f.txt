True, but your opening your cookie does not *force* Lucky to open his at the
same time. This is one fault with this model. The 'state' of the cookies are
not inter-dependant as the polarization of the photon pairs are.

It isn't instantanous, the correlation existed when they were printed and
doesn't change. If I destroy one of the cookies it doesn't destroy the other
spontaneously as would happen in a correlated photon-pair. The state of the
individual cookies exists because of the observer and not a fundamental
requirement of the cookies existing.

On this we can agree.

Incorrect. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that in order to
measure one parameter the other must *necessarily* change because they are
in actuality different aspects of the *same* characteristic. They are *not*
indipendant aspects of the system being observed. Momentum and position are
different sides of the same coin. A conservation effect is what we are
dealing with. This same conservation issue arises, and in fact allows
FTL state transitions, with bound photon-pairs.

Not quite. In the act of measuring one parameter we necessarily change the
other. That change is what we can't measure *at the same time* not the
absolute value at a given time tau.

Only if the light has a single polarization. If you shine a circularly
polarized light through you will in fact see light on the other side.
