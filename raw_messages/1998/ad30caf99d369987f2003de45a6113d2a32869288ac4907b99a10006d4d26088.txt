To Whomever is interested in fighting the National ID:

    The Dept. of Transportation has a pending regulation which is the
basis for the national ID. The deadline for submitting objections is
Oct. 2 and we need to have several thousand objections filed with the
DoT. There are about 2200 objections filed so far.

I have my own letter objecting to the national ID posted to the "fight
the
fingerprint" webpage, which is accessed thru:

                http://www.networkusa.org/index.shtml

All you have to do is personalize it for yourself. Specifically, my
letter
is posted at this URL:

http://www.networkusa.org/fingerprint/page1b/fp-dot-becraft-reg-obj.html

Scott McDonald also has a suggested letter posted on this same page, and

it is found at:

http://www.networkusa.org/fingerprint/page1b/fp-dot-reg-obj-format.html

Please take a few moments to download and copy any of these letters,
personalize it for yourself and mail it in. Please circulate this note
so that people will send in more objections.
