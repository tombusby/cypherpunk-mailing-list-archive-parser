>
>President Bill Clinton is playing war games
>on a top secret computer to come up with a
>way to be an international hero, according to
>the man who designed the system. 
>
>According to Rev. Curt Tomlin, a former
>member of the battle staff of both presidents
>John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson,
>Clinton is a desperate man who is like an
>animal trapped in a corner. He will do
>anything to regain his credibility and deflect
>criticism from his impending impeachment
>hearings, he says. He also is driven by his
>desire to create a positive legacy of his time in
>the White House, according to various
>reports. 
>
>Clinton's motivations are dangerous to the
>security of our nation, according to Tomlin. It
>was Tomlin who designed and perfected the
>Pentagon's first war games computer system,
>the top secret "Single Integrated Operating Procedure." 
>
>The "SIOP" computer is a method of targeting
>a military attack and evaluating the most
>likely response to that attack, according to
>Tomlin. Highly classified intelligence
>information is gathered from all over the
>world by the CIA and other sources, placed in
>the computer, and then accessed by Clinton to
>play his own personal war games. 
>
>"The decisions he's making right now are
>totally illogical and irresponsible," Tomlin
>told WorldNetDaily in an exclusive interview.
>"Looking at the power and everything he's got
>at his finger tips. That's a dangerous situation
>for a spastic individual." 
>
>Tomlin has maintained silence about the top
>secret program for many years. He has been
>called out of retirement three times and has
>served in the Navy, Air Force, and Army for a
>combined total of just over 24 years. He has
>also been hired by government contractors to
>assist in computer intelligence systems
>designed to improve security for military
>computer systems. 
>
>"I could be sticking my neck on the chopping
>block for a number of reasons," said Tomlin of
>his decision to make his information public.
>"Number one is, I'm still under some lifetime
>restrictions on security clearances. For
>example two of the clearances I had above top
>secret was ESI and category 7 and 9. That was
>three above that. Those are lifetime. So I have
>to be a little bit careful about what I put in
>print. I think people have to be aware of this,
>regardless of the consequences on my end. I
>feel that I would be guilty of the military
>crime of negligence of duty if I did not bring
>this to somebody's attention," explained
>Tomlin. 
>
>Clinton had tried to become an international
>hero by destroying hundreds of terrorists
>being trained by Osama bin Laden in
>Afghanistan and a chemical weapons plant in
>Sudan. Those two missile attacks were chosen
>through use of the SIOP computer to which
>Clinton has access, according to Tomlin. 
>
>The computer predicted the result of the
>attacks would bring about the death of
>hundreds of terrorist forces and eliminate a
>chemical weapons factory. Someone
>intervened to change the results, according to
>an intelligence source who spoke only on
>condition of anonymity. 
>
>Reports in European newspapers after the
>attacks by Clinton corroborate what that
>source claimed. "There were no dead
>terrorists, and the chemical weapons plant
>was an innocent pharmaceutical plant. Instead
>of being a hero, Clinton is an international
>laughing stock. The terrorists were tipped off
>and cleared the area. The real chemical
>weapons plant was two miles away. It was a
>combination of bad intelligence and
>purposeful intervention," said the source. 
>
>Clinton has been searching the SIOP system
>ever since the failure in an effort to find
>another opportunity to prove himself to the
>world and become the international hero he
>envisions for his legacy, according to the
>source. Tomlin agrees. 
>
>"There's no choice. He's either going to sink or
>try again. We can look for some very
>unpleasant responses, depending on the
>target he chooses," says Tomlin. 
>
>When Clinton actually succeeds at inflicting
>damage to a group of international terrorists,
>many experts believe there will be swift and
>deadly retaliation. Americans are in danger of
>massive chemical and biological attacks in
>major metropolitan areas, as well as similar
>attacks on large military bases. 
>Tomlin says he is personally aware of
>unprotected water supplies to domestic
>military bases that could provide terrorists an
>opportunity to poison the drinking water
>used by most of the nation's military. 
>"When you contaminate a water supply ...
>that's almost beyond my comprehension," he
>remarked. The open borders of the United
>States make it a simple process for terrorists
>to come into the country and bring their
>weapons of mass destruction with them
>without detection," he says. "They can come
>and go as they please with any kind of cargo.
>That border is literally wide open, regardless
>of what INS tells you," warned Tomlin. 
>
>Tomlin believes there are many terrorist
>agents already located in the United States
>waiting for orders to strike. Other sources
>have independently confirmed that claim but
>were unwilling to be identified. 
>
>"There's no doubt that the U.S. is currently in
>the greatest danger of massive domestic
>attack from an external enemy than ever
>before in our nation's history," agreed one
>intelligence source who is equally concerned
>about Clinton pushing such terrorists to the
>point to massive retaliation. "They just need
>an excuse," he said. 
>
>"Of course, the president has available to him
>an awesome military force that he can use to
>launch a first strike on any target in the
>world," explained Tomlin of the top secret
>system available to Clinton. "One of the things
>I have been real concerned about recently is
>the type of response that we can expect from
>these various targets that the president can
>choose from. For example, if he chose to hit
>target A, the computer system would come
>back and tell him what kind of response he
>can expect. Will that response be in the nature
>of an explosive response like blowing up an
>embassy? Will it be in the form of a chemical
>or biological response, or a combination of the
>two? And it will also tell him, will the
>response be a psychological or political
>response, or a combination of any of these? In
>other words, the system will come back and
>tell him exactly what he can expect the owners
>of that target to do in retaliation," explained
>Tomlin, the father of that real-life computer
>war game. 
>
>"We got an awful lot of our information
>through CIA on site sources where these
>various targets were located," Tomlin says.
>"We could tell you anything you wanted to
>know about that target. How thick the walls
>were, if it were a structure, how far under
>ground it goes. How many megatons of
>explosives it would take to wipe it out totally,
>or give you 50 percent destruction, or 75
>percent destruction. We could just tell you
>anything you wanted to know about that
>target." 
>The highly advanced computer system as
>well as the automated launch and attack
>systems enable Clinton to initiate an attack
>without the knowledge of very many other
>individuals. Such decisions could be made by
>Clinton alone, or with just a few political
>advisers. Military and security advisers could
>be left in the dark. 
>
>"That's what bothers me today," says Tomlin.
>"Given the fact that the man in the White
>House now has his finger on the trigger, and
>he can launch those forces which still consist
>of atomic warheads on any intercontinental
>ballistic missile. He can create a situation that
>could be very detrimental to this country.
>There are certain things that I'm really
>concerned about at this point in time
>concerning the highly probable responses that
>the president can expect as the result of
>striking certain targets." 
>
>With SIOP, Clinton can sit at his private
>computer and play war games until he finds
>the situation he likes best. He can literally
>type in various attacks around the world and
>the SIOP computer will tell him what will be
>the likely results of such an attack. With the
>push of a button he can turn the computer
>simulation he likes best into reality. 
>
>"The ones I am concerned about now is the
>possibility of a chemical or biological
>response to a specific strike that he would
>initiate," said Tomlin of his fear. "Simply
>because an explosive response is limited in
>scope. It's a token. It's a warning. But when
>you drop a very small amount of biological or
>chemical agents into the water supply of a
>large city of Dallas or Houston, my friend, we
>have a problem in that area. You can bring
>these agents through customs on our southern
>border almost undetected. There's just very
>little possibility of these things being detected
>coming through Customs or just walking
>across the border in a deserted area." 
>
>Tomlin created the SIOP computer back in
>1963 when he served on the Kennedy battle
>staff. He continued to serve on the Johnson
>battle staff as well. Since then he has helped
>the military work on numerous top secret
>defense projects and information systems. 
>
>Tomlin did his work in the top secret
>underground "site R," as well as in the
>Pentagon war room. His work was considered
>so critical that he had a 24-hour armed Marine
>guard watching over him. 
>
>Although Tomlin is now retired, he still lives
>by Fort Hood in Texas and has many
>neighbors who are current and former
>military. He claims there are many who are
>getting out of the service because of Clinton. 
>
>"Unfortunately," says Tomlin, "that's the
>sentiment that is running rampant among
>military people in this area. If you cannot
>trust your leader, then we have a problem.
>This man cannot be trusted. They are
>deserting (their careers). I'm talking about our
>combat experienced veterans. They're giving
>up 18 years, 17 years and so forth and getting
>out because they can no longer trust their
>leader. They don't want to be a part of what he
>might create." 
>Tomlin expects Clinton to launch an attack
>very soon that will bring devastating
>domestic retaliation to the U.S. 
>"If I were still on active duty, either as an
>enlisted man or as a commissioned officer,
>knowing what I know now, looking at all of
>the information I have available to me, I
>would have no choice but to resign my
>commission or terminate my enlistment
>simply because there is no way that I could
>now trust my commander in chief," said Tomlin.

>
>In an exclusive WorldNetDaily article yesterday,
>Tomlin detailed his fears that Clinton is using a war
>games computer to find a new target he can attack.
>Clinton's goal, according to Tomlin, is to become an
>international hero. Tomlin, who created the nation's
>first computer war game system, known as "SIOP,"
>for the Pentagon, fears that Clinton's actions will
>bring devastating retaliation from terrorists who are
>just waiting for an excuse to activate their plan of
>domestic attack against the U.S. 
>
>Although Tomlin believes the greatest danger to the
>U.S. is from biological and chemical weapons, he is
>also concerned about electronic warfare. Tomlin
>believes Clinton is very upset with a large portion of
>the nation that wants him impeached. He says
>Clinton is planning a way to get back at his enemies
>in a big way. 
>
>"This man (Clinton) is extremely vindictive and he's
>going to get back at the country one way or another,"
>said Tomlin, who is also concerned about Clinton's
>recent attempt to use the SIOP computer to attack
>alleged terrorist sites in Afghanistan and Sudan.
>Tomlin believes new attacks are imminent in order
>to turn the previous failure to damage the terrorists
>into a major victory that will make Clinton an
>international hero. 
>
>Tomlin expects domestic retaliation from the next
>attack by Clinton to be devastating. He says terrorists
>are already in the U.S. awaiting orders to attack, a
>claim supported by a recently intercepted fax sent
>world wide to 5,000 "soldiers" loyal to Osama bin
>Laden. The faxed order, reported in London and
>Jerusalem newspapers recently, tells the terrorists to
>be prepared to attack U.S. and Israel in four ways
>very soon. 
>According to the fax, the attacks would be designed to 
>
>Bring commercial airlines to a halt 
>Stop all maritime traffic 
>Occupy U.S. embassies around the world 
>Shut down U.S. banking 
>
>Such actions would seem difficult to achieve, but
>Tomlin says it would actually be easy to accomplish
>with access to electronics warfare devices. Although
>his greatest concern is chemical or biological attack,
>he said he would not be surprised if the attack came
>through electronics. Virtually everything from
>military aircraft to TV remotes would be disabled,
>according to Tomlin. 
>Tomlin was called out of retirement in 1995 to
>participate in a top secret project. He worked in the
>10th Mountain Division as a senior test plan analyst. 
>
>"You know that your automobile has an electronic
>ignition in it," explained Tomlin. "It also has a
>computer inside that. Did you know that we can
>immobilize every moving vehicle in this country
>with a few key strokes of a computer, all at the same
>time? 
>
>"By using the LEO satellites," he described, "you can
>disrupt the computers. You can stop that electronic
>ignition. It's all electronically based. You can
>interfere with it and stop it dead in it's tracks." 
>
>Tomlin also worked on tests dealing with laser
>technology and the global positioning system, but he
>did not provide details of those tests or their
>purpose. He did say the testing was extensive and
>was all for military purposes. 
>It is clear that China and other countries have this
>same technology, agreed Tomlin. He believes the
>recent intercepted bin Laden fax is evidence that
>terrorists have this same ability. Electronic warfare
>would make all four of the stated goals easily attainable. 
>
>Tomlin is risking legal action by the Pentagon for
>revealing top secret information. That's a risk he says
>he is willing to take because of the danger he
>believes has been caused by an out-of-control president. 
>
>"The decisions he's making right now are totally

>
>"If that's the way it turns out, I will not be at all

>
>"The ultimate end product of these programs the
>government has been working on is to create a
>generation of people who will readily accept sudden
>and radical change without question, without
>objection, and without opposition. That's the goal of
>these programs in a nutshell. This is headed toward
>a one-world government without any question
>what-so-ever, he warns. These programs have been
>going on for a long time. People need to pay
>attention to what Outcome-Based Education is all
>about, what Goals 2000 is all about, and these other
>socialistic programs that are leading in this direction.
>It's upon us," warned Tomlin. 
>
>In recent years Tomlin has been teaching and writing
>college courses dealing with electronic data
>processing. He tells his students, "If you can think of
>it, you can do it. Your only limitation is your own
>imagination. There are no limitations when it comes
>to electronics. 
>
>"Y2K is going to be one of the biggest problems
>you've ever seen in your life, coupled with the other
>intentional (electronic) interferences we're talking
>about." 
>
>Tomlin says he entered a Navy competition back in
>1963 for a mystery computer assignment. After two
>weeks of competition with many others who wanted
>the top secret, undisclosed position, Tomlin was
>notified to pack his bags and report to the Pentagon. 
>"I had no idea what I would be doing until I walked
>into the front door. I had to compete for that job. At
>that time there were 700 of us in the Navy who had
>shown specific talent and progress for designing
>information and processing systems. That was Navy
>wide because data processing was so new at that
>time," explained Tomlin. 
>
>"There was three places we worked out of. Site R,
>which was the underground command post, the war
>room in the Pentagon -- the JCS war room. We also
>had a facility on the North Hampton, which was a
>light cruiser. That was also the Presidents alternate
>battle site on that cruiser. Later we also had a facility
>on the U.S. Wright, which was a converted jeep
>carrier from World War II." 
>
>When he first arrived he was the youngest, 30, and
>lowest ranked, petty officer, member of the Kennedy
>battle staff. No one on the team knew just what they
>wanted or expected from Tomlin, so he just observed
>and tried to find ways to put his skills to use. 
>
>"Nobody on the battle team was capable of telling
>me what they wanted me to do," he said. "So I
>iddled around there for a couple of weeks just
>watching what the rest of the battle staff did during
>their exercises and their presidential briefings and
>stuff like that. Kind of with my hands in my pockets.
>We had a worldwide battle exercise and I wandered
>around the war room and watched them post the
>status boards, the maps, and process the 'twixes' as
>we called them back then. That's all the messages
>and the strikes and the targets. Finally, I concluded
>that these guys were doing this the hard way." 
>Tomlin, accompanied by his armed Marine guard
>who was with him 24 hours a day, went to work in
>the seclusion of his underground war room at site R.
>He began putting together some very simple
>procedures using IBM punch cards on the latest and
>greatest computer 1963 technology had to offer.
>Within just a few weeks another war game was
>called and Tomlin was ready to show off his
>creation, which he created totally on his own. 
>
>"We had a war game, and while they were doing
>heir thing out there, nobody paid any attention to
>me and nobody knew I was around. So I went back
>and I got copies of all the incoming data and I did
>my thing and I threw my shoulders back one day
>and just started posting the status boards and
>everybody else -- all these lieutenant colonels and
>colonels and brigadier generals and everybody else
>-- were all gathered around the conference table and
>somebody said, 'Tomlin what the hell are you
>doing?' I said, 'Well, I'm plotting the results of these
>various strikes.' And they said, 'Who told you to do
>that?' I said, 'Nobody did.' 
>
>"They got to looking at their conclusions and my
>conclusions and they were identical. What took 30 or
>40 folks for them to do, well I did it by myself in just
>a matter of minutes," described Tomlin of his first
>war games computer program. So that got their
>attention, and that's where everything started. So the
>next time around they used my computerized war
>game, which was the first one the Department of
>Defense ever had. Then later I got tasked to build a
>system for the targets, and then the rate of
>production for atomic weapons storage and
>accountability, and all that good stuff. It just kind of
>exploded (military computer assignments) from
>there." 
>
>The military had never called retirees back into
>full-time active duty until they needed Tomlin
>during the Gulf War. They needed him and didn't
>have a policy in place that enabled them to bring him
>back, pay him, and give him credit towards his
>retirement benefits. 
>Tomlin is listed as a military resource with critical
>skills, so the government made the necessary

>computer systems and redesign internal security for
>6.9 million records. The commercial company he
>worked with to accomplish the task is owned by
>Ross Perot, he pointed out.
