I don't know if this story has reached the AP wire or not but today the
brave defenders of the faith here in Pensacola, FL have done their sworn
duty to protect us all by arresting a 5yr old on assault charges (againts
one of the Adult staff of the school).

These are the same brave soles who a few months ago when confronted by a
man sitting in his car with a gun to his head solved this problem by
riddeling his car, surrounding buildings, and a McDonalds playground with
over 100 rounds.

As soon as I have some more information on this I will post a full report.
