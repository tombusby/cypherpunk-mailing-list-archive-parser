We are pleased to announce another paper in our Essays in Political
Economy series:

"The Private Production of Defense" by Hans-Hermann Hoppe (Professor of
Economics, University of Nevada, Las Vegas; Senior Fellow, the Ludwig von
Mises Institute).

>From the essay:

"Among the most popular and consequential beliefs of our age is the belief
in collective security. Nothing less significant than the legitimacy of the
modern state rests on this belief. And yet, the idea of a collective
security is a myth that provides no justification for the modern state.
Private-property owners, cooperation based on the division of labor, and
market competition can and should provide defense from aggression."

This powerful and radical essay can be purchased here

or by calling 334-844-2500.

The price is $4.00 postpaid (no postage charges will appear on your credit
card, regardless of what your shopping basket says).

As we approach the new year, we wish you a happy one, and hope you enjoy
Clifford F. Thies's article on millennial hysteria and its historic
connection with socialist ideology.

In the next few days on Mises.org, we'll feature an article on the Euro and
coverage of the continuing debate between Robert Bork (taking the statist
position) and Michael Kinsley (taking the free-market position) on
Microsoft's future. It may seem like a strange turnabout, but even stranger
things have happened this month, in addition to the political turmoil in the
Belly of the Beast: the Mises Institute and the Village Voice agreed-that
the U.S. government should not be destroying people and property in Iraq.
