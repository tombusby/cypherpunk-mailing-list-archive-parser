       WPI Cryptography and Information Security Seminar

               Prof. David Finkel, CS Dept., WPI

   PERFORMANCE AND SECURITY IN WEB-BASED ELECTRONIC COMMERCE


                       Wednesday, October 14
                         4:00 pm,  AK 108
                    (refreshments at 3:45 pm)


This talk reports on the results of a performance evaluation of a testbed
electronic commerce application on the World Wide Web.  The study measured
the performance of the system using different levels of security, and offers
some insights into the performance costs of security for such an
installation.  In addition, we discuss the performance implications of
different implementation strategies.  The work represents a joint effort by
researchers from WPI and Stratus Computer, Inc.
