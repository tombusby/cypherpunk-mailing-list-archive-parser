Hi everybody!

Have a look at Scientific American August 1998 for an article by L. Adleman (of RSA fame) about how he 
solved a computationnally gigantic problem in less than a second with a few drops of stinking liquid 
:-)    Unfortunately, the article is not available from www.sciam.com, so you'll have to buy the paper 
version of the magazine.   *FASCINATING*

Also, have a look at
