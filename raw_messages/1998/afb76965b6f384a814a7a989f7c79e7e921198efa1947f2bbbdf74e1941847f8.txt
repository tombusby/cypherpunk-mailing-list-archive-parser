KeyNote is a trust-management system, designed on the same principles
as PolicyMaker, but simpler and better-defined. This is the first
public release, and although the code has been tested, it is by no
means guaranteed bug-free (but then, what is). That said, you can get
a copy from

	   http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~angelos/keynote-0.1.tar.gz

PS. From the README file:

There should be a real README file here, but in the meantime read
draft-angelos-spki-keynote-01.txt for the spec of KeyNote.

There's much to be done yet to improve the user interface(s). Signature      
verification is (deliberately) missing from this release, but the next one
will have it. The hooks are obvious in the code (search for XXX in
parse_assertion.c).

The makefile creates the libkeynote.a library which can be linked with other
applications. The program keynote-verify can be used to verify a request,
given a set of assertions and an environment. There will be a man page
in the next release both for the library and the program, along with some
sort of graphical UI to make assertion generation (including signing) easier.

For any questions, comments, bug reports, praise, or anything else you have
in mind, contact me at angelos@dsl.cis.upenn.edu
