Abstract:

A working free-space quantum key distribution system has been developed and
tested over an outdoor optical path of ~ 1 km at Los Alamos National
Laboratory under nighttime conditions.  Results show that free-space quantum
key distribution can provide secure real-time key distribution between
parties who have a need to communicate secretly.  Finally, we examine the
feasibility of surface to satellite quantum key distribution.
