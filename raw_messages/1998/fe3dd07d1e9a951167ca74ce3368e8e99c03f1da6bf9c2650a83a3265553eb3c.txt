I haven't a clue who to ask, but it would surprise me a bit.

If it was done, it would have been for microwave lines,
which are mostly obsolete except in places like
Southern Utah and parts of Montana and the Dakotas which
don't have enough population density to justify replacing with fiber.
Much more likely they were routed through reservations for 
cheap right of way.  Most of the routes have been pretty stable
for a long time, because of right-of-way issues, and many of them
date from back before the FBI and CIA worried about little details
like Constitutionality and different rules on Indian reservations.
