Sorry about this, but I'd really like to see a decrease
in the traffic through mccain and tea from next weekend
lasting the next couple of months.  I'm thinking of helping
this decrease by adjusting the remailer configuration
variables, and restricting the time I spend dialled-up.

In view of the fact that some people will press on anyway
it's probably best if most of you regard these 2 remailers
as temporarily closed.  If you have a reply block leading
through tea, and it gets low traffic, and you can tolerate
extra delay you might wish to leave it in place.

This is nothing to do with the recent modem problem, nor
the size of my phone bill, and I have not been got at by GCHQ.
I have a really good reason for this, and if you knew what I know ...

Hope to be business as usual by late March.  I am not
contemplating a permanent shutdown.
