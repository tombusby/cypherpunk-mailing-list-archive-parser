Judge Leroy Hansen has ordered Morales to court [with court reporter] to
answer and probably be sanctioned for taking the 5th on his deposition.

Morales outlined what he planned to do at lunch.

Today I got a CONFIDENTIAL envelope from EEOC Inspector General's
office in Washington.  No doubt a response to my Privacy Act violation
complaint.

Several years ago a Department of Interior whistleblower gave me number
of
book references.  One was a book written by Felton during the Vietnam
era.

Felton's book is only available from the University of New Mexico main
Zimmerman library.

The book was usually checked out when I phoned to ask if it was
available.

The 'black hole' of government we are encountering in the Court system
and
through administrative appeals prompted me to look up a word.

Here is a dictionary definition.

  a political and economic movement, strongly nationalistic, magnifying
the rights
  of the state as opposed to those of the individual, in which industry,
though
  remaining largely under private ownership, and all administrative
political units, 
  are controlled by a strong central government.

When I asked the librarian about Felton's book, the response was usually

	You mean, The Rise of Acid Fascism in America.

I responded, yes.

Full title of Felton's book is seen at

I guess what we are seeing with the 'black hole' of the court system and
federal government 
with respect to my Privacy Act violation complaint, the WRITTEN felony
perjury complaint on Sandia lawyer Gregory Cone, the dockets we COULD
not get BEFORE

  http://www.jya.com/whp-10usca.htm 

is that while United States of America is only a democracy in name, 

The US is, in fact, operated as a fascist state by bureaucrats.  

Who go totally insane about the subject of cryptography.
  
Citizens should do something about this.  

Some are. http://www.aci.net/kalliste/
