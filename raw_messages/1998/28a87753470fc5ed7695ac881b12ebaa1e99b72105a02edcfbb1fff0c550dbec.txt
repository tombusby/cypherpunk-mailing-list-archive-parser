Came across this by chance...having never heard of this 'disgruntled'
web site, I'm curious as to how the PO managed to learn about the
offending story...if they fired him because of an explicity fictional
article expressing a fantasy shared by vast hordes of Americans then
it kind of looks like the Post Office 'went postal' on one of their
employees.

>   The story, "Scrooged Again," appeared to have struck a nerve with his
