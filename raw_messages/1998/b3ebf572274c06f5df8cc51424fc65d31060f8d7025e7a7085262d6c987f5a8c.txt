Standard interoperation of different protocols.  We do it all the time.

If voluntary interaction doesn't work as a social system then we're all in
big trouble because persons (you?) who love to command others will have a
hard time doing so as everyone becomes rich, mobile, and technologically
powerful.  If you have figured out a way to push around rich, mobile, and
technologically powerful people you're a smarter man than I am.  I'm sure
the Feds could use your unique insights.

BTW we live in a representative republic not a democracy and the theory was
that it was to be a representative republic of strictly limited powers.
Our representatives have forgotten.  Technology and market institutions are
teaching them different.
