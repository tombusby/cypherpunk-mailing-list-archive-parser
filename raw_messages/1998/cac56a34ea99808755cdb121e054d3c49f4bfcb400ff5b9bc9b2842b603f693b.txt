I visited Anna Holmes' <fogbow@sprynet.com> (the moderator of the
Married but Lesbian [MarBLes] mailing list) website at
http://home.sprynet.com/sprynet/fogbow/ and discovered that she's a
licensed shrink who lives in Birmingham, AL.  Thus, there may be
some "deep pockets" in the form of her malpractice insurance, as
well as the hosts of the mailing list itself, queernet.org.

I'm not sure what sort of other action is possible, but I'm sure if
Holmes were "supporting" the defrauding of African Americans rather
than married men, Jesse Jackson would figure out a way to bring some
pressure to bear against her and those aiding and abetting her
clandestine activities.
