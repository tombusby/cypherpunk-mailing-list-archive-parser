Local eternity servers get their data from a news feed.  Preferably a
local news feed, or a satellite based feed, or second choice SSL
encrypted NNTP server, third choice NNTP server.

(Reason for local news feed being preferabl is that it protects the
NNTP traffic which would otherwise allow eavesdroppers to observer
which articles you were reading.  SSL is only a partial solution
because you are then trusting the SSL NNTP server operator.) 

Local servers don't generate any traffic, "local server" is really a
misnomer, it is a local proxy for reading news... it presents a view
of USENET articles which makes them appear as web pages.  It keeps
copies of those web pages more up to date versions are read in news,
this allows fast access to the web space.

There is a trade off between update period and size of web space as
the amount of USENET traffic you can generate without annoying people
is limited.
