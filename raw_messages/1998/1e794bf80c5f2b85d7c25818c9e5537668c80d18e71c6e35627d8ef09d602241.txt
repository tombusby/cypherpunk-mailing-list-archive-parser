This argument is based on the misconception that people have no reason to
want to accept fiat money. But actually fiat money is valuable because it
performs a service for those who use it, namely the service of a medium of
exchange. It's value derives from the fact that there is positive demand
for a medium of exchange, and the fact that its supply is finite and
controlled by a sufficiently benevolent agency.

Think about it this way. In the case of commodity money, its value comes
partly from the industrial/aesthetic value of the commodity and partly
from the usefulness of the commodity money as a medium of exchange. In the
case of fiat money and b-money, all of its value comes from its usefulness
as a medium of exchange.
