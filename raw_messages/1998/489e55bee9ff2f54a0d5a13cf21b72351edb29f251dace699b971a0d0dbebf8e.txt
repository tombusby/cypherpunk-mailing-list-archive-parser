Exactly. And it is as it should be. Consider that speech is *not* equivalent
to action (eg. swinging a fist). Running an enterprise or engaging in some
activity *is* equivalent to the party swinging their fist. They have a
*right* to swing it so long as it *doesn't* interfere in others right to
swing their fist *and* the first parties swinging doesn't strike the second
party. In short, a party has the right to make as much money as they like,
however that right does not extend to the point of inhibiting others from
similar opportunities. A free market monopolizes, that monopolization
inhibits others from expressing their rights in the same manner that hitting
some person in the face inhibits their fist swinging because they are out
cold on the floor. As a consequence a free market is inherently inhibiting
on free expression - something any self-respecting anarchist won't put up
with. So we are left with the very simple conclusion that any anarchist
worth the title won't put up with a free market because it creates an
environment that creates a monarchy.

It is logicaly inconsistent, and philosophicaly nonsensical, to talk about
being an anarchist of any ilk *and* talking about supporting free markets.
