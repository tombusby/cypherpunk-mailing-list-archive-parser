Implementation of the Wassenaar Arrangement List of Dual-Use
Items: Revisions to the Commerce Control List and Reporting Under the
Wassenaar Arrangement

AGENCY: Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce.

ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: Representatives of thirty-three countries gave final approval
July 12-13, 1996 in Vienna, Austria to establish the Wassenaar
Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods
and Technologies. The thirty-three countries agreed to control all
items in the List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies with the objective
of preventing unauthorized transfers. They further agreed on a target
date of November 1, 1996, for implementation of the Wassenaar Lists.

    The purpose of this interim rule is to make the changes to the
Commerce Control List necessary to implement the Wassenaar List. In
addition, this interim rule imposes new reporting requirements on
persons that export certain items controlled under the Wassenaar
Arrangement to non-member countries in order to fulfill the information
exchange requirements of the Wassenaar Arrangement. The Department of
Commerce, with other concerned agencies, is reviewing the Export
Administration Regulations to determine whether further changes will be
required to implement the information sharing provisions of the
Wassenaar Arrangement and to make the necessary adjustments to existing
country groups.

    This rule also revises part 740 of the EAR by removing License
Exception availability for certain items controlled for missile
technology reasons.

    Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August 20,
1994, the President invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers
Act and continued in effect, to the extent permitted by law, the
provisions of the EAA and the EAR in Executive Order 12924 of August
19, 1994, as extended by the President's notices of August 15, 1995,
August 14, 1996 and August 15, 1997.

DATES: This rule is effective January 15, 1998. Comments on this rule
must be received on or before February 17, 1998.

ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to Patricia Muldonian,
Regulatory Policy Division, Bureau of Export Administration, Department
of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Lewis, Director, Office of
Strategic Trade and Foreign Policy Controls, Bureau of Export
Administration, Telephone: (202) 482-0092.
