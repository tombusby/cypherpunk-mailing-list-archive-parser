Are you possibly confusing Tempest with a NEMA certified case? Educalc used
to sell a case for the HP-41C calculator that they touted as NBC certified.

I would suggest looking for one of the NIST certified environmental test
cases that are available. They'll cook or chill your electronics and block
the emissions quite handily. Be shure to get a supply for the copper door
gaskets, they wear out under daily use about 3-4 times a year.
