There's at least one firm which makes this stuff commercially, their products
are available via http://www.appsig.com/prods/index.html.  This looks like a
one-stop ECHELON shop: you take one or more of their products (pick your type,
intended target, and budget), plug as many E1's or E3's or whatever into one 
side as you can handle (the most impressive one does 16 E3's or 7680 voice/
data channels) and all modem, fax, and voice comms going through the circuit 
are available on the other side.  They have products to do automatic channel/
signal scanning, demuxing, decoding of various data formats, processing of 
satellite and radio signals ("combines tuning, demodulation, descrambling, 
decoding, demultiplexing, and output formatting in one chassis"), every kind 
of mobile phone signal you've ever heard of, digital microwave links, decoding 
of higher-level protocols like V.42/V.42bis, X.25, HDLC, PPP, every Internet 
protocol worth doing, etc etc (their terminology is pretty neat, they have for 
example a 1.5-44.7Mbps "modem for on-the-move applications" :-).  Much of the 
hardware claims to be built to TEMPEST specs.  One interesting point is that 
most of their stuff is for E1's and E3's even though they're a US company.  
Hmmm....
