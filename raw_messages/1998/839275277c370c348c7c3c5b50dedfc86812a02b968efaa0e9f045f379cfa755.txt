Wow! I haven't seen a Real Copy, ever!  I was once a high school field trip
to the National Archives, circa 1968, but our teachers told us the
Constitution was now classified as a subversive document. It had been on
the Index since 1933.

Maybe the extermination of the rats under the hood will be accomplished as
a side effect of the Y2K problem.

We ought to urge our fellow sheeple to have _short trials_ for the millions
of rats we need to exterminate. After all, they can't exactly appeal to the
Supreme Court if the Supremes preceded them to the gallows, can they?
