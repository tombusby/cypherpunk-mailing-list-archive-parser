Could our group be charged as a "continuing criminal enterprise" under the
RICO statute?

It occurs to me that if Carl Johnson, who is linked several times to our
group/list in the court documents, is successfully prosecuted,then the Feds
may be able to cite both Bell and Johnson as evidence of a conspiracy.

Which probably wouldn't be too hard to prove, as many of us have admitted
to conspiring mightily to undermine various institutions. (And we even use
encypted e-mail, the very essence of a secret conspiracy.)

It might be fun to see them try this. Would they charge some of us as
ringleaders? Or would they declare the entity itself an illegal
organization? (As they have done with various cultural, political, and even
religous groups, like Hezbollah, the Aum religion, etc.)

Interesting times.
