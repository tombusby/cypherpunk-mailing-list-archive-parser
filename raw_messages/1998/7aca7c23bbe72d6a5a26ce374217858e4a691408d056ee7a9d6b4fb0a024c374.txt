Mailing lists and news groups are filling up with nitwits like this character.

Nitwits who can't compose coherent thoughts, nitwits who can't even put
sentences together without major grammar and spelling erros, and nitwits
who have nothing to say.

Some are from Yahoo, some from MyDejaNews (tm), some from HotMail. And then
there are the unilluminati from WebTV and AOL.

A lot of people need to be taken out and shot. Or at least globally killfiled.
