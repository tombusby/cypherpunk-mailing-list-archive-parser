They have stated so openly; ~"if we hear a lot of encrypted hiss from [CALEA]
intercepts, we'll need GAK to be the law of the land". (a tilde before the
quote means I am paraphrasing).

In fact, at the same time the FBI used to say they weren't calling for
such a law, they were pushing behind the scenes for it.

Declan, wanna track down this person and find out the names of those
who spoke of the ultra-secret UKUSA treaty that's never been seen,
and interview them?

When Sonny Bono hit a tree, yet another Senator convinced by the FBI/NSA's
little presentation of horrors (which is preceded by a visible sweep for
electronic bugs) was lost. Only an Executive Order seems like it will get
domestic crypto "outlawed".

One continued worrisome slant to the FBI/NSAs pushing for domestic GAK
is that they use the same arguments for retaining export controls (which
Clinton did by Executive Order, or they would have expired) as they give
for wanting to extend these controls domestically.

LART me if I'm wrong, but that makes the issue different from most
other export-controlled non-secret technology/products.

I still think someone (without a job ;-) should test the export law
by pulling in PGP from outside the US and then immediately putting
it back at the same site.

If could find someone on the lower East Side willing to do it
for $5000. Gilmore, care to make another investment in making
the government's position look silly? ;-)
