Junkbuster, which I've been playing with, too has just a list of URL
patterns that are blocked. When it encounters such an URL, it
displays this hardcoded spiel:

char CBLOCK[] = "HTTP/1.0 202 Request for blocked URL\n"
		 "Pragma: no-cache\n"
		 "Last-Modified: Thu Jul 31, 1997 07:42:22 pm GMT\n"
		 "Expires:       Thu Jul 31, 1997 07:42:22 pm GMT\n"
		 "Content-Type: text/html\n\n"
		 "<html>\n"
		 "<head>\n"
		 "<title>Internet Junkbuster: Request for blocked URL</title>\n"
		 "</head>\n"
		 WHITEBG
		 "<center>"
		 "<a href=http://internet.junkbuster.com/ij-blocked-url?%s+%s+%s>"
		 BANNER
		 "</a>"
		 "</center>"
		 "</body>\n"
		 "</html>\n"
		 ;

Notice something unpleasant!!! See the 2 %s's? They are filled with
1) the URL you tried to access, 2) the pattern from the blockfile that matched.
But they're not just displayed in your browser; only if you click on the
junkbuster logo, they are passed to a cgi script at the junkbusters site,
which displays them and possibly logs them.  Not nice at all.

I'd much prefer a filtering proxy that
allowed different actions for different patterns in the block file:
at the very least, the choices should be "404 not found", "403 verbotten",
a 1x1 jpg, and a user-specified replacement text/url.

The ability to edit the incoming text and pictures to delete embedded ads
would be awfully nice.  Consider for example the html dynamically generated
by wired's cgi script when you access http://stocks.hotbox.com.
(take a look at it).
Wouldn't it be nice if the proxy could be told to delete or replace all the
text between <!-- ad strip --> and <!-- end ad strip -->???

Occasionally an ad is embedded in a picture together with some useful
information.  Take a look at http://www.bloomberg.com/gifs/iview.gif.
it has both useful information that should be displayed and sponsor
informaion that should be mercilessly censored - replaced by a user-specified
graphic or at least a black rectangle.

Instead of spamming the mailing list, I've put up a web page at
http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/6354
(let's see if they pull the plug on it)

I have also placed some cookies for sharing on them same web site.

Death to the Usenet Cabal!
