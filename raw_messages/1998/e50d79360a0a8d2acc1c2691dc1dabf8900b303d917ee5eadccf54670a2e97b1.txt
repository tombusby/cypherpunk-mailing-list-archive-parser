Damn! I thought we had everyone fooled.

Death of a Legend / The Truth About the CypherPunks:
The CypherPunks have long been renowned as standing at the bleeding edge 
of
the burdgeoning computer technology which is rapidly changing the face 
of our
planet and the governmental, civil, and social societies encompassed 
within
this celestial orb.
Harbingers of the Digital Future / Pioneers of Future Technology / etc., 
etc.
Bullshit...
The CypherPunks are rag-tag band of infantile, pseudo-anarchistic, 
pseudo-
cryptic, well-educated shit-disturbers who take great pleasure in 
pissing on
themselves, each other, and the world around them--all the while, 
covering
their motivations and ambitions with high-sounding ideals intended to 
disguise
the fact that none of them ever received proper toilet-training.


The end result?
No matter how high they pile it, how far they spread it, or how badly it 
smells when you step in it, they end up coming off as the Henry 
Kissinger's
of CyberSpace, because no matter how much rotten meat, jalapenos and 
moldy
cheese they eat, they can never manage to crap out anything so vile and 
foul-
smelling that the world-at-large cannot prove prophetic in MeatSpace.
