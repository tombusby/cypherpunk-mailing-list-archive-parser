	We weren't talking about Government Contracting (which I'll agree
with you would be politely called a scam), but rather in a crypto-anarchic
enviroment whereby an insurer or several insurers would pay a subcontractor
(the local fire prevention/suppression company).

	It's not illegal for me to die my hair Green and Pick, and wear a
Tutu and black patent leather pumps. In this case, it probably should be,
but isn't.

	Not in any legal book in this country.

	So it's time for the feds to get out. We can't afford more roads,
and they aren't needed.

	It benefits far more from the rapidly deteriorating rail system,
and besides, we have enough roads.

	Actually, I was thinking of the one that Teddy Rossevelt was in,
unless I have my history confused.

	If IRC, Roosevelt Attacked (or counterattacked) Mexico in the late
1800's or early 1900's.

	That would have been after the Indian Wars, After the UnCivil War.
Anyway, there hasn't been a war fought on the Main Land USA in a LONG
fucking time, and the next one's going to be another UnCivil war where the
roads will help both sides.

	It's a crap excuse.
