	Sub-contracting can often lead to cost savings. For instance,
instead of each insurer having their own fire station network, they could
all share one, and only pay a certain cost-per-subscriber.

	Kind of like today where insurers don't usually own hospitals &
doctors offices.

barbequing either.

	Extravagance isn't always bad. I just spent 1 1/2 weeks (well
almost) living at a hotel in Sunnyvale on Playboy's dime. They let us spend
a bit of money, stay in nice hotels (Marriot Residence Inn), eat pretty
much what we want (I've never hit the meal limits, but I don't eat too
fancy) we can get up to a full sized car (they wouldn't let me rent a
motorcycle, but that was more insurance than anything), it is a bit on the
extravagant side, but I was also working 10 to 15 hour days for 12 straight
days (worked before I left to go out there as well). It's sort of a
"payment in kind".

	It isn't the extravagance of Business, it's the idiotic things they
spend money on. Microsoft Exchange for instance. About 5 times more
expensive than a competitive product, and about 20 times more expensive
than the cheapest commercial solution that will work.

	There is also a lot of free software out there that does the same
thing.

	So no, I am not going to try to say that Business is has to be more
efficient than Government, just that the market is usually more efficient
than Government.

	Look at the IRS, they make their own rules, and send bills to
people randomly.

	Oh, they had an excuse, someone wearing blue jeans and a leather
jacket robbed a store--On the other side of town, and I was walking.

	It is when the law used has been thrown out of court every time
it's used, and citizens complain, but the cops still use it to harass
people.

	There are quite a few roads in Chicago that are maintained by state
and federal funds.

	Supposed to or not, that is what they get used for. LSD in Chicago
is maintained in part by federal funds, it is a (mostly) controled access
highway entirely within Chicago.

	Listen Fuckwad:
	(1) there are paved roads from one coast to the other, as well as
railways.
	(2) There hasn't been a war fought on CONUS since we attacked Mexico.
	(3) Most of the roads being built with federal funds are for
"congestion  relief", not roads to new places so troops can move.

	Most roads being built today are either for Suburbs, or for more
efficiently getting people to and from job centers. If you don't believe
that, you are a fool

	There hasn't been a military case for building superhighways since
the 1930's and 40's.

	The Army. Marines, and National Guard are fully capable of getting
whereever they need to go with our without the current highway system, if
they weren't they'd be worthless.

	Also, it is just as easy for the OpFors to use the roads as it is
for the friendlies. I am not saying you are lying with this one, I just
can't believe that anyone was foolish enough to fall for it.

	I, and others are saying that there is no way of building a system
that cannot, and indeed will not be abused.

	Most people are honest--TO A POINT, and the integrity people have
is getting less and less.

	If everyone you know is honest and has integrity, then you must not
know very many people. None of your friends cheat on their taxes (cheating
is dishonest, refusing to pay would show integrity, if AND ONLY IF it
follows from a belief that the system has no right to demand your labor)
etc?

	Any system is flawed, and I will repeat myself:

	(a)Any system will work if enough of the people in that system are
honest, have integrity, believe in the system and want it to work. Any
system.

	(b)No system will work if a large enough number of people within
that system try to cheat, coopt, or otherwise "get over" on that system.

	Given the above, anarchy will work just as well as any other system
in the long run because the world more closely resembles (b) than (a),
hence any system will fail.

	No, no, I promote anarchy, you are promoting governments which do
those things.
