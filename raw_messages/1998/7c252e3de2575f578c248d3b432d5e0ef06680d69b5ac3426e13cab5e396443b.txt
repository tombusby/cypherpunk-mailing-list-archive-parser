This is reprehensibile!

HyperReal-Anon is alerting a Confirmed Net Terrorist to a planned U.S.
cruise missile attack on Harald. Harald's crimes are not important. What is
important is that the U.S. Muffdiver William Jefferson Clinton has orded
the Northern Fleet to strike Harald's home and hometown and to report that
Harald was a known associate of both Asama bin Laden and Phillip
Zimmermann, known freedom fighters.

Harald will learn that Six Degrees is monitoring all thoughtcrimes.

Besides, Harald apparently used Roundup in his garden, the same nerve gas
precursor found at the Baby Milk and Marzipan Factory in Khartoum. This
means that Harald was manufacturing nerve gas in his Swedish home.
