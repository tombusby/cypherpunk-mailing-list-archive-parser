Apparently the girls problems had been going on for a while, if the reports
are accurate. Which raises the question of why she was still in a regular
school environment in the first place. If it was a 'all of a sudden' attack
then perhaps the instructor needs some looking into as well.

I'd like to know what the 'significant blood loss' from scratches was
refering to, as well as what experience the teacher had with the child prior
to this.
