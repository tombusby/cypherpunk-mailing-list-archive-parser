They couldn't get Capone any other way but on Income Tax Evasion ... we 
all know how much more guilty of how many more heinous crimes he was ... 
but we took him the only way we could ... Clinton is no different ... it 
would be grand and so fitting if we could impeach himt for having 
committed aggravated assault upon the Bill of Rights, but if we have to 
get him because he can't keep his pecker zipped up then so be it ... as 
with case of Al Capone, this country will also be richer without William 
Jefferson (Thomas must be rolling in his grave!) Klinton!
