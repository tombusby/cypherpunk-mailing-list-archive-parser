Sameer asks that, due to building access limitations,
everybody please show up by 2pm to be sure the guards will let you in, and
"humor building management and sign in as requested by the guard".

And there's a parking lot on Franklin between 12th and 13th,
which is a block or two east/south of Broadway.
