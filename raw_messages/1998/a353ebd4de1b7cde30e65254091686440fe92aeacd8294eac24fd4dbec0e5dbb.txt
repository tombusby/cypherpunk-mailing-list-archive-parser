SAC Technologies Showcases Complete Electronic Security Solution 

              Company To Unveil Next Generation Biometrics Technology
                Prototype Product at Security 2001 Conference

    NEW YORK, Sept. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- SAC Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:
SACM), a biometrics technology development company, today announced the
Company will unveil a manufacturing prototype of its fully integrated
solution for electronic security applications through biometrics
identification technology at the September 16-17, 1998 Westergaard/Mallon
Security 2001 Conference in New York.

    "A recent survey by the American Society for Industrial Security noted
that losses due to intellectual theft have reached almost $300 billion,"
according to SAC CEO Mr. Barry Wendt. "Computer security is a major concern
with electronic commerce, Internet transactions, on-line banking and
security in general.  Unlike other security measures such as PIN numbers,
passwords or tokens which can easily be lost, stolen or forgotten,
biometrics technology is based on an individual's physical characteristics,
such as a fingerprint, so
it requires the physical presence of an authorized user." 

    SAC Technologies, Inc. plans to introduce the next evolution of its
SACcat(TM) product at the two-day investment conference.  Bundled with
'best of breed' biometrics technology consisting of fingerprint
identification, voice verification and facial recognition, SACcat(TM)
features software applications of computer log-on, screen-saver, and
desktop security and configuration.  Additional integrated software
applications will include Bio-Key(TM) secured video teleconferencing and
video e-mail and SAC_Secure(TM) for selectively encrypting program
applications, data files and network communications using Certicom Corp.'s
elliptic curve engine.

    At the heart of SAC's biometric identification technology is the
Company's "Vector Line Type" Algorithm (VLTA) considered by some to be the
most robust, reliable, scaleable and discriminating algorithm available
today.  VLTA represents a true paradigm shift from current industry
minutiae-based methods of storing and analyzing fingerprints.  VLTA
processes the entire pattern of the fingerprint to derive a list of vector
line types and their associated relationships.

    These unique characteristics of the fingerprint are subsequently
transformed into a vector line type mathematical model or Bio-Key(TM),
which is highly unique and easy to process for comparative purposes.

    Unlike biometric verification (one-to-one matching) processes produced
by its competitors which require an additional identifier (pin number,
token or password), SAC's technology provides for true, real-time
identification (one-to-many) -- the process of comparing the biometric
characteristics of an unknown individual against characteristics stored in
a database to determine their identity.  SAC's certified biometric
identification technology can provide the necessary discrimination to
determine the identity of a user and
thereby insure the integrity of an application by eliminating the
possibility of 'aliases' (multiple identities).  SAC is the first, and
currently remains the only, company in the world to earn the International
Computer Security
Association's (ICSA) biometric 'identification' certification.

    "This latest version of the SACcat(TM) product is a 'turn-key,'
cost-effective hardware and software biometrics security and convenience
solution for individual computer workstations and networks," said Mr.
Wendt.  "We believe that SACcat(TM) is an ideal complement to computer
network security suites provided by such companies as Network Associates,
Secure Computing, Check Point and Security Dynamics."

    "Within a year from now I am convinced that consumers will be asking
whether biometrics security is included in their information systems and
computer applications.  Companies who do not add biometric security to
their product offerings will lose market share.  Compaq, one of the world's
largest providers of PCs, will have a biometrics peripheral product
available this fall.  Other computer providers could gain competitive
advantage by negotiating an exclusive license with the Company to
manufacture, embed and
distribute SACcat(TM) technology," added Mr. Wendt. 

    Companies interested in SAC Technologies' SACcat(TM) biometric security
solution should contact Mr. Barry Wendt at 708-798-9777 or for more
