Churches monopolize faith (but let's not go there).

Tell that to the Isreali's and the Arab's, the Serbs and the Slav's, The
Hutu's and the whoever they are I can't think of at the moment, the Irish
Protestants and Catholics, etc., etc., ad nausium...

A free-market is defined as consisting of the supplier and the consumer
without a regulatory body. It doesn't prohibit a third group *wanting* to
regulate that market. Or of either the producer or consumer using violence
to prevent it.

What's the specific difference? What is the fundamental litmus test between
a Laisez Faire and a Anarcho? In one case there is no recognized arch to be
had to regulate the market and in the other the third party simply opts out
of participating. In what way are the resulting markets different from
either the producers or consumers view?
