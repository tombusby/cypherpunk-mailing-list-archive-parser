Dear One Nation supporter in NSW

Now that an election has been called your support in the lead up to and
during the Federal Election will be critical.

It is quite clear that the major parties are funded by big business at this
time and the people's party, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, will need to use
the will and common sense of the people to make an impact at this election.
We do not expect any favours from the mainstream media.

I would sincerely request that you take a stand against the current
political system that has not served us well and show your support by
contacting the people listed below by email or phone to see how you can help
at this critical time. As our mailing list now numbers over 10,000 please do
