  Only an asshole without the brainpower to recognize the importance of
open discussions of Tanya Harding's chances of forging a new career in
the WorldWide Wrestling Federation would also fail to recognize that
differences of opinion over the size of jockey shorts that Chris Lewis
should be required to wear is essential to the future of the IntereNet.
 
  Privacy Admin (if that is your *real* name...) would be well advised
to consider the astronomical rise in cost of InterNet access that could
result from AOL'ers learning to successfully unsubscribe from mailing
lists, instead of subsidizing the rest of us by paying exhorbitant
fees to send multiple messages saying, "I'm SERIOUS! Unscribvive me 
from this fucking mailing list or I will keep complaining, instead of
buying a clue!"

  If the foregoing doesn't seem to make sense, it's OK, because I
am a list scibviver. (Although I have been unsuccessfully trying
to ubscrivive for the last several months.)
