	As far as I know, conspiring to END the government, or change the
government is perfectly legal, as long as you are not planning on using
violence to carry it out.

	We (well, as many as are, we is a difficult thing on this list) are
prepared to _resist with violence_ the invasion of our homes, and (to a
different extent) the removal of our rights, but those are in themselves
illegal things, so defending oneself from them is the most basic
"inalienable right".

	Then again, we are dealing with the Peoples United Soverign States
Government.

	Well, at least for those of you rich enough to pay for lawyers. The
rest of us will either have to plea, flee, or die.

	Hmmm, if they were to do this, how bout we have a second set of
servers running the distributed mailing list software under a different
name, say Sinderallapunx, or OldDemocrapunks.

	Ok, so being a "member" of cypherpunks is illegal, change the name,
let them have their "victory".
