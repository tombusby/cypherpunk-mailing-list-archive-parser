Whether the 1 is there or not is irrelevant,

3x3x3x3... is not 3 in the first place.

3x1x1x1x1.... IS 3.

This definition of a prime has one serious drawback.

It ignores the fundamental identity theorem of arithmatic:

 1 * n = n

So, as a result we're in the interesting and potentialy untenable
situation of defining a identity theorem, base our math on it, and then
come along one day and say it doesn't apply anymore WITHOUT making any
other changes to the structure of the theories....

This is VERY BAD science/math.
