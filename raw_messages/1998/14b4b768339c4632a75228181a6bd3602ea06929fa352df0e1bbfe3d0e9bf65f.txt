Sorry for the cross-posting, but some of the readers may
hopefully address this:
Could you recommend me a censorship FREE InterNet Service
Provider that in addition to a "no censorship" policy also
guarantees  your privacy.
I am an ex-patriate Danish who live in the United States, but
has a friend who wants to publish material deemed hateful in my
birth country.
In Denmark, they still struggle with laws abridging freedom of
expression in regard to "hate speech."
Could you recommend any ISP to me in the United States that
satisfies this?
I know Cyberpass in California does not censor based on content.
But I am sure there are many many others.
Please respond in personal mail or to cypherpunks@cyberpass.net.
