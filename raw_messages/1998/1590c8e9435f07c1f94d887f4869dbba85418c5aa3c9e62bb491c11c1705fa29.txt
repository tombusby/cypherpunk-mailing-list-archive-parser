Third. We had a Second American Revolution and we lost.

Well this goes back to the "privacy rights" debate that has been going off
and on the list for quite awhlie now. The key to the whole thing is not
more bad laws and government regulation but removing the power of the
State to collect the information in the first place. (If we didn't have
the corrupt and bankrupt SS program then we wouldn't have to worry about
how SS #'s were used would we?)

I figure the best time for a strike is during a Presidential Inagural
Address or a State of the Union when all the players are in DC in one
convenient location.
