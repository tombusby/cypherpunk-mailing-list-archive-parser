Echelon. Also see [*1 below]

remailers are carriers. ECPA says that if you do not review content, you aren't
responsible for it.

Archivers are content providers. They have to make do with a 1st ammendment fig leaf.
What archives are there? There is one in Singapore (outside jurisdiction) and one
at sof.mit.edu that mysteriously went off the air a little while ago. Or was it
something more sinister?

On the topic of ECPA, I did an archive search: (my comments in [])

My question is this: how does he know that the mail is encrypted if he's
not examining the mail that passes through his system? If he *is*
examining the mail that passes through his system, it seems likely that he
is violating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.

Steve Jackson Games v. US Secret Service
 
by Peter D. Kennedy

[preamble]

The Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
 
Two provisions of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (or
ECPA) were paramount in the suit. The plaintiffs claimed the
Secret Service violated two provisions -- one prohibiting
unjustified "disclosure and use" of e-mail (18 U.S.C. 2703; the
other prohibiting "interception" of e-mail (18 U.S.C. 22511(1)).

[*1 Interesting. Maybe they have Toto for something intercepted illegally
 and they're trying to find it from another source (by subpoena).]

[re: public domain software on ftp archives]

It matters not, IMHO, since an ftp archive site qualifies as a library
open to the public.
