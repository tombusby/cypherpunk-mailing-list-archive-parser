------------------------------------
Definition of 'fucking': adjective
an intensifier used with other adjectives to emphasis. Like "bloody" it is also one of the very few examples of an 'infix' [a word 
component inserted before the stressed syllable in the middle of a polysyllabic word] in English.
    e.g. 'Jesus, it's f****** cold in here.'
    e.g. 'Abso-fucking-lutely.'

Definition of 'scumbag': noun, [origin] American
a deceptive person. This term of abuse is now widespread and is permitted in the broadcast media, in spite of the fact that its 
origin, unknown to many of its users, is as an obscene phemism for condom, 'scum' being an obsolescent American term for 
semen. The word was adopted by British speakers around 1985.
    e.g.. 'Even scumbags have right here in the USA.' [Red Heat, US film 1988]
