New book: 'GLOBALISATION: DEMISE OF THE AUSTRALIAN NATION'. 
 
This is Graham Strachan's follow-up to his controversial sellout success, 
'Economic Rationalism: a Disaster for Australia'. (See articles at: <A 
href="http://www.gwb.com.au/gwb/news/economic">http://www.gwb.com.au/gwb/news/economic)
 
We recommend it to those who are concerned about where Australia will be, 
and has been going under the Laboral factions (Labor and Coalition parties) for 
the last 20 PLUS years.
 
Globalisation is no longer a conspiracy theory: it is official Government 
(and Opposition) policy! The only secret now is just what 'globalisation' 
means.According to the power elites it involves 'trade liberalisation' 
and that's it. In fact it goes far beyond that, and includes political and 
social globalisation as well. This book explains how it is all being engineered 
behind a screen of lies and half truths by dishonest politicians, corrupt media, 
and treacherous elites in business, government bureaucracies, academia and the 
churches, with the aid of false economic and social theories. While it 
concentrates on economic deceit, this book goes on to uncover the complete 
globalisation programme. The real nature of Globalism might surprise 
you!At $15 plus $2.50 postage (with discounts on both book and postage 
for larger orders) every Australian must read this book. Ordering details at
