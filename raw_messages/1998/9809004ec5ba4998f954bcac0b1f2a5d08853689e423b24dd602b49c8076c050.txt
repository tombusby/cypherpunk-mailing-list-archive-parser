Yahoo! Accounts - Top Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q. How is the Yahoo! ID stored?

A. It is stored as a "cookie" on your local computer.
This way, you only need to sign in once. If you upgrade 
your browser software, or change computers, you will
probably be asked for your Yahoo! ID.  Because we usually 
do not ask for a Yahoo! ID, many people forget their Yahoo! 
ID and/or password.  Save this e-mail message to remember 
your Yahoo! ID.

Q. What if I forget my password?

A. Every Sign in page has a link at the bottom in case you have 
problems signing in.  This link will lead you to form that you 
can use to have a new password assigned to you.  You will need 
to remember your Yahoo! ID, and we will ask for your birthdate 
(as you entered it when you registered).

Q. What if I forget my Yahoo! ID?

A. Every Sign in page has a link at the bottom in case you 
have problems signing in.  This link will lead you to a form 
that you can use to retrieve your Yahoo! ID.  You will need to 
provide us with your email address, birthdate and zip code, 
as you entered it when you registered (so that we can verify you)

Q. I'm sure I've typed the right Yahoo! ID/password, but I keep 
getting rejected. Why?

A. Follow the instructions on the "Forgot your password"
page. If you are positive your Yahoo! ID and password are
correct, there is a small possibility that the system
is temporarily down. You should try again after several
hours. If you are unable to sign in for 24 hours, chances
are your account information is not what you think it is.

Q. How do I know if I am signed in?

A. All personalized areas require a Yahoo! ID except Netscape 
Guide. You will be prompted for a Yahoo! ID and password whenever you
try to access the different areas above. If you are not prompted, 
you are already signed in.


Q. I use a shared computer, how do I sign out?

A. If you are using "public" computers, you should
always sign out to "clear" your Yahoo! ID and cookie from
the computer's hard drive. The bottom of most pages
contain a "Change User" or "Sign Out" button. If you 
do not see one, go to http://my.yahoo.com and use
the "Sign-Out" link at the top of the page.

Q. I've changed E-Mail providers, how do I update
   my information?

A. Go to http://my.yahoo.com and click on the
Account Information link at the top of the page.
The edit page will let you update your E-Mail address, 
and other personal information and preferences.

Q. How much is all this going to cost me?

A. Absolutely nothing. All Yahoo information is
paid for through advertising. 

Q. But I still have so many unanswered questions!

A. Try the help links and images located in the
specific customized area you are using. You can also
send E-mail to us using the feedback link at the bottom
of most pages.

Thank you for using Yahoo!
