Electronic Birth Certificates and Social Security Cards at Birth Make Life
Easier For Parents

Februrary 6, 1966 (sic)

The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services Bureau of Vital
Statistics reports that the Electronic Birth Certificates (EBC) have been
installed in all but three of Alaska's hospitals. In a little over a two
year time period, the Bureau has gone from no electronic birth certificates
to nearly 99% of all Alaska hospital births coming to the Bureau in
electronic format. "Innumerable man-hours have been saved at both ends of
the registration process," said Al Zangri, Chief of the Bureau. In
addition, in cooperation with state-wide hospitals, the Bureau has
implemented the Social Security Administration's Enumeration At Birth (EAB)
program statewide during 1995. The Enumeration at Birth program allows
parents to request a social security number for their newborn through the
birth registration process. This program has proven to be so popular with
new parents that nearly 93% of all births transmitted to the Bureau request
a social security number.
