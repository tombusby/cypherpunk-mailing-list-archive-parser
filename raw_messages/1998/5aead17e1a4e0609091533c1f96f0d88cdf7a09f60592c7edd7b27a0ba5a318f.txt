Dear Bruce,

the Microsoft Patent 5,768,385 filed Aug. 29, 1995, issued Jun. 16, 1998
on "Untraceable Electronic Cash" is nothing more than a well written remake
of the "Anonymously Transferable Standard Values" presented at IFIP Sec
1986 under the name "Anonymous Standard Value Accounts", published both in
the Pre- and Post-Proceedings there, more detailed in a research report of
1987 and even published in a refereed journal, Computers & Security in
1989, see below.

I do not know the legal system of the US well enough to know whether
challenging the patent is worthwhile and I do neither have the time nor
money to do it for myself, but I think it is at least worthwhile for the
security community to know.

So please feel free to distribute this information, e.g. within CRYPTO-GRAM.

Yours Andreas
