In CA only "junk" cars can be unregistered. An unregistered car on private
property can be cited under a long list of circumstances. 

>
>It is legal to drive an unregistered car without a driver's license (in

It is never "legal" to drive an unregistered vehicle (or even tow it
without a trailer) on CA roads. The judge may let you off if you have "a
real good reason". But the cops can and in most cases will cite you!

>

roads.

I do believe that there are some legal restrictions for children purchasing
cars...

>
>You are not required to report the purchase of a car to anyone.  

Since every car in CA MUST be registered, every change of ownership must be
reported. If you do not you are subject to a fine. They give you ten days
to report the transfer of ownership.

>
>It is legal to drive a car on public streets and roads in the US with a

Only for a limited period of time in CA...

>
>It is legal to drive a car on public streets and roads in the US that is
>registered in other states or nations.

Not if the owner is a resident of CA, and again only for a limited period
of time.

>
>It is legal to drive a car on public streets and roads in the US that is
>owned by and registered to any person or legal entity.
>

But they assume all the liability and even possible criminal consequences
for letting unlicensed persons drive the car.
