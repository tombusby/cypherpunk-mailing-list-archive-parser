Of course it's possible to rape a man.  Just because he becomes erect
doesn't mean he desires sexual intercourse.  People are more than the
instictive reactions their body produces.  Someone who chooses not to
engage in sex, but is coerced into doing so, is raped, regardless of
his body's physical reactions.  The key element is coercion.  Erections
or other bodily responses have nothing to do with it.

Consider a murderer who ties his victim to a chair and rigs a diabolical
device.  A hammer strikes the victim's tendon below his knee, causing
his leg to reflexively kick and set off a bomb.  The murdere is caught
but argues that the person committed suicide, since he kicked the bomb
switch himself.
