	If there is a universal syntax, you could very quickly
	whip up a framework for the language involved and at least
	be able to identify nouns, verbs, etc. Then with each commun-
	ication expand and specify. I don't know if that's possible
	and therefore don't know if it's 'theoretical mumbo-jumbo'.
	It doesn't sound too far-fetched but then I'm an optomistic
	kinda guy eh.

	We had plenty of time in Somalia to capture 'Warlord' Aidide.
	Not only did we fail to capture him, he rubbed it in with a
	daily radio program. We couldn't find the ever-moving trans-
	mitter let alone close it down. I well remember our top Butt
	Sniffer in Somalia royally pissed off on TV vowing that we'd
	throw everything we had into the hunt and bring him to justice.
	Aidide was still standing there, flipping us The Bird as we 
	left. 
	My impression was that the Somalies 'under-teched' us. Being
	dirt-poor must have made that an easy decision. But they 
	executed it very well. The most powerful, technologically soph-
	isticated military machine in human history found itself
	groping stupidly in the dark when up against a non-tech
	foe. We're obviously utterlly and completely dependent on 
	our toys. Take our batteries away and we're S.O.L.

	Hmmm...There it is again. It's interesting but a bit ambiguous.
