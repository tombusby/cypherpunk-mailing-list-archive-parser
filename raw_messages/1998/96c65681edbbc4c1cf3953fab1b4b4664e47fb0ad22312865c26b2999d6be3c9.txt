Dear Aladdin Expander User,

Did you know there's a new windows shareware utility from Aladdin
that just made cross-platform communication easier? It's called
Aladdin DropStuff, and if you send files back and forth to Mac
users, it'll make your life a whole lot happier! Already, early
users of DropStuff are telling us it's a godsend. For all the details
now, click here http://www.digitalriver.com/AladdinDSWin10/PC.

With Aladdin DropStuff for Windows, in addition to creating Zip
archives, you can also compress in the StuffIt format, the compression
standard for the Mac. So now, you can send a file from your PC to a
Mac user, and they can open it, edit it, and send it back to you
seamlessly and transparently! Or, if like lots of people, you use a
Mac at home and a PC at the office, DropStuff makes it even easier to
transmit and open files you send back and forth from home and work.

DropStuff is loaded with the power user features you need, like the
ability to compress and mail files in one easy step, right from the
Windows desktop with just a right mouse click! Plus, DropStuff lets
you join StuffIt file segments you may receive from a Mac user.
With Aladdin DropStuff, it's like your PC just learned to speak a
whole new language!

Aladdin DropStuff for Windows is a great deal at $20. But for a
limited time, we're offering DropStuff to Aladdin Expander users for
the amazing price of just $14.95! That's a savings of 25% on the
world's first universal compression utility for the PC!

Get DropStuff now at http://www.digitalriver.com/AladdinDSWin10/PC

This special price of $14.95 is for a limited time only! Don't miss
out on the savings.
