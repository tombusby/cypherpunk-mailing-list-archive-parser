Jim, Et al,
Recently I heard the retelling of a 'verbal memo' given contracted security
folks at Miami International Airport concerning spotting people with
'excessive cash'.  Besides the racist profiles and the cues of buying a
ticket with cash, destinations were high on the list and Las Vegas was the
most often mentioned destination for a 'good collar' (ie. cash
confiscation).  The feds are offering a reward of a percentage of what is
confiscated to the informants, in this case ticket sellers, baggage handlers
and local security providers (contractor and local police).  Seems that
bring more than 4 -5 K worth of green to gamble with is an excuse for
confiscation with no charges ever being made.  The operative mode here is an
assumption that they'll snag some wise guys and they won't freak and try to
regain their bucks....bad assumption and bad intentions.  This is the kind
of citizen vs. citizen activity that the East Germans and their Nazi mentors
were master in establishing and effecting.  The best way to destroy trust is
to a profit incentive to poke your face into your neighbor's garbage can and
report the droppings to the collectors of irrelavant information at the
ministry of injustice.
