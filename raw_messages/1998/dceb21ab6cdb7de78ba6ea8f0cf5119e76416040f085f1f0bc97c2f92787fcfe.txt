Now *this* should be fun. Someone who claims to be a cypherpunk is now
going to call the copyright police on a non-profit, volunteer news list.

Cryptoanarchy indeed. The ganglia twitch.

When the going gets tough, the "tough" rat out the innocent, it appears...

Cheers,

I dunno.

But I've begun netcopping the Ignition-Point list on
an ongoing basis (starting Friday), and they'll be
an interesting test case of whether what they're
doing is "fair use".

Pobox.com/listbox.com is reluctantly assigning a person
to receive (my) copyright complaints, and will register
themselves with the FCO.

I like to post whole articles myself.

Anyway, for a test case, better them than me.
