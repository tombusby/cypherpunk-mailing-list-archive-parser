This month's Utne Reader came with an attached 4.25"x8.5" booklet.  An e-copy
of the said booklet is available from their site.

Its contents, much like the magazine, contains articles snipped and or
adapted from elsewhere.  Unfortunately the thread throughout the whole thing
is "those who go in the woods with automatic rifles are the bad selfish
guys."

IMHO, helping your family and 'hood is a great thing.  Being labeled a kook
if you are selfish and have no instinct other than self preservation isn't
such a great thing.

This sort of thought will only lead to a further erosion of freedom and a
fall towards communism as more and more people will feel pressured into
"sharing" their property and resources with the commune rather than
hoarding.  By all means, make everyone aware of the problems and help them
cope if that's what you want to do, just don't force others to do the same at
gunpoint.  :)

It does have some redeeming qualities though if you ignore the political
sharing slant.  The articles they've included (save for the "Public Citizen"
section) are good planning guides.
