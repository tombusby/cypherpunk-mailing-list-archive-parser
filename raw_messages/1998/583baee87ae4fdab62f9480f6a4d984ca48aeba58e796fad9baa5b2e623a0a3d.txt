U.S. Negotiators Ask For Public Feedback in Talks With Europe Over Privacy
Law

NEW YORK - Raising the stakes in its talks with Europe over a new privacy
law there, the Commerce Department on Wednesday publicly reaffirmed a
laissez-faire approach toward protecting personal privacy that remains at
odds on key positions taken by European negotiators.

The Commerce Department released a statement for public feedback that
details its basic position in the talks. The talks attempt to resolve deep
differences over a sweeping European privacy measure that has the potential
to disrupt some commerce with the United States.

The law took effect on Oct. 26, but sanctions were suspended while the
talks go on.

U.S. firms from global drug makers to direct marketers doing business in
Europe fear the new directive could bar them from using customers'
confidential information for everything from valuable scientific research
to junk mail, stifling business commerce.

In its position paper, the U.S. reiterated its view that U.S. companies
should not be forced to give people access to personal information about
themselves. In addition, companies should have the option to choose an
independent industry group to police its privacy policies, instead of a
government body, as required by the European law.

"For now, we're trying to get (Europe's) reaction to these principles
themselves,'' said David Aaron, under secretary of Commerce. Aaron said the
United States wants to give companies "safe harbors'' to satisfy privacy
protection demands.

Some experts said the government's seeking of public comment could suggest
that the United States may seek to modify its position if enough people
favor the European approach.

"This is significant because it is the first time that the Commerce
Department has asked for public comment on its negotiating position with
the European Union,'' said Joel Reidenberg, a law professor at Fordham
University and an expert on U.S.-Europe relations.

A Commerce Department spokeswoman said the principles would be posted on
its Web site.
