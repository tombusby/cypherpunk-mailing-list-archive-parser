That you for CCing the enclosed message.

I must admit that I'm rather puzzled by it.  This is the first I've
head of an "E.M Cordian," or for that matter "M.F. Tones" or
"Mr. Rogue."  I am quite sure, however, that I am none of these
people.  I have also never seen, or claimed to have seen, any
description of the RSA algorithm, other than the the recently
declassified public key historical material from GCHQ, that predates
R, S and A's original paper on the subject.

I don't subscribe to the cypherpunks mailing list (or, for that
matter, DCSB), and I've only just now scanned over the web page
mentioned in your message, so I'm unclear as to what might be going
on.  Perhaps someone is confused about the $7.00 "better DES
challenge" that I offered last year (which was solved this year by the
EFF DES brute force hardware).

Whatever this is about, however, I assure you that any use of my name
in connection with a solicitation for funds for some sort of
"analytical DES cracking" effort, or any suggestion that I'm involved
in such a project, is absolutely false and perhaps fraudulent.

Feel free to forward this as you see fit.

Thanks
