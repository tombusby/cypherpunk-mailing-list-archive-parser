Not really.

Interesting question.  Open a delaware corporation and sell 
munition-quality gate arrays in the back pages of Popular Electronics
or EE Times... keep us posted...

Duh :-)

* 10,000 gates cost less than a paper clip.  500K is high for a block cipher.

* If we don't find something to do with them, at the rate we're producing
them,
the earth will be covered with silicon and its compounds soon.   :-)

* Its not like we'd ever put floating point routines, or blitting routines,
out of business by integrating those functions in Si, is it?
Naah, we'd never accelerate encryption with hardware, 
the CPU is bored and has nothing better to do, and its soooo expensive
to print chips..

(That being said, I'll point out to myself how many asics have been replaced
by dsps...but not without some inefficiency)

* PGPfone on a  very fast cpu plus fast link is still less pleasant than
a noisy cordless (no pun intended).

* We'd never take encryption hardware through the same path as modems,
would we?
First used between companies, then used for remote access, eventually you
can't buy a bloody machine without one.  Getting cheaper, faster, closer
to the motherboard, taken for granted by applications.  Ever seen a 300
baud, 40 lb modem, cost probably $3000 in 1970 dollars?  

The final level of deployment is when garage-door-openers, car remotes, and
childrens' toys (e.g., radio controlled cars) use encryption chips... or
chips with encryption, anyway.

Yes, the PC can be used as an untrusted router if the encryption is done
outside it.  The outside encrypting unit should also perform NAT, otherwise
the PC (doing the tunnelling) can broadcast traffic ('trap and trace' in
the pots world)
info.  The lower power used in PDAs really helps keep the boys in the White
Van

Email is so low-bandwidth that software suffices.  Secure video
conferencing on your
Dick Tracy (tm) telewatch needs h/w support.
