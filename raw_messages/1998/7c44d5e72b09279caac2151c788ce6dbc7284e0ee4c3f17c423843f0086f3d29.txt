Hi
This is a true story. Denmark now - along with the whole EU - has
assimilated US-crypto laws.
I just had a phone conversation with the danish ministry of commerce,
the export control division. The kind lady I spoke to threatened me with
fines or jail for up to two years.

For having PGP for free download on my homepage!

I called the division to hear about the Wassenaar arrangement on
export-restrictions on strong crypto and its consequences. So I ask this
lady something like: I have this strong crypto program called PGP on my
homepage. What should I do. Does this Wassenaar arrangement concern me?
	'It sure does', she replies, and start to ask a lot of questions about
my homepage - does it have unlimited global access etc. And then she
says: 'You better take it down', and starts to reiterate the legal
aspects, e.g. two laws from EU on export restrictions.
	Specifically she points out the penal code: Fines. Jail.
	So...
	I'm _not_ going to take down PGP voluntarily. Otoh I'm going to SHOUT
this out loud. (I have already contacted two members of parliament and
will start calling all 179 later today.)
	Lets see what happens...
