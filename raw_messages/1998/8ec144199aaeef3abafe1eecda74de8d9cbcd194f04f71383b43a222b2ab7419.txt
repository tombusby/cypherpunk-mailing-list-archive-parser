Nothing surprising about it - just implant your basic lost-pet ID chip,
and set up a detector to read it.  All commercially available except
perhaps the computer interface to the detector, which isn't
all that complex either.  The more interesting journalism question isn't 
the lack of archive-checking by the journalist or this year's
claimant to firstness, but what political spin the professor tried to push 
with his press release and interviews and whether it was accepted
blithely or skeptically.
