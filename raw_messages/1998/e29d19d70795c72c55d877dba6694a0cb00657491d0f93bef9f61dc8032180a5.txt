     Excuse my shorthand:  Not all "personal" philosophies are religions.

     Personal philosophies are a superset of personal religious
beliefs.  Personal philosophies that include the concept of a god are
clearly religious in nature.  Personal philosophies that include the
concept of "faith" are probably religious in nature.  Personal
philosophies that include the concepts of empirical evidence,
sceptical inquiry, and willingness to reject previously held positions
due to new evidence or argument are probably not religious in nature.

     The reason I challenged your assertion is that religious people
often use such statements as a basis for further arguments that end up
equivocating based on the term religion.  They first broaden the
definition, by fiat, to be almost meaningless and then later use a
much narrower definition to support their ultimate point.  I'm not
suggesting that you were going to do this; I am simply pointing out
why it is something of a sore point.

     No, they are not.  The distinction is crucial to the main point I
evidently failed to make in my previous message:  Atheism is not a set
of beliefs that constitutes a personal philosophy.  There are Buddhist
atheists, Universalist-Unitarian atheists, objectivist atheists,
Wiccan atheists, etc.  Atheism isn't even a belief, it is merely the
statement of a lack of one particular belief.

     Getting back to the strong v. weak distinction, the weak atheist
position that one "does not believe god(s) exist" does not constitute
a belief, a set of beliefs, or a personal philosophy, let alone a
religion.  The strong atheist position that one "believes god(s) do
not exist" is actually making a knowledge claim and so does constitute
a belief.  Recognizing that someone holds the strong atheist position
may give some clues to their other beliefs and the remainder of their
personal philosophy, but, again, that position alone does not
constitute a personal philosophy or religion.

     I'm not trying to prove anything either.  I'm simply pointing out
some issues regarding atheism that are too often ignored or confused.

     Now this part of the discussion I entered to satisfy my own
curiosity.  Since it is so far off-topic for this list I'd be glad to
take it to personal email if you wish.  When you say "more than the
earthly veil" do you mean that there exist phenomena that cannot, even
in principle, be detected by our five senses or by any physical
mechanism we can create?  If so, how do you know and why would it
matter?
