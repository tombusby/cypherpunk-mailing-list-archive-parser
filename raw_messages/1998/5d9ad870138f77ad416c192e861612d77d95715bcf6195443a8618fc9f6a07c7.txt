I thought the list might be interested to know that we have in fact had
"more than a few" angry emails about being down on the 14th: hit-em where
it hurts, and they *have* to listen, huh?  For the most part, the response
has been favorable, *after* they have been educated as to what is going
on.  These are the same people who, by and large, could care less about
the average "political thing"...

As I said before, I acknowledge that this "strike" takes out it's energy
on those least responsible (directly, anyway), but it *does* seem to wake
them up, since it directly involves them [now]...

Anyone else having similar experiences? (I'm really curious about
openpgp.net)

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
