No, actually your complaints about spam are TRUE theft of 
services.  In an article that I posted to this list last year it says 
the following:

Mailing-list spammers

Email spam is the favorite gripe of most Netizens, excepting the
spammers. Congress is considering legislation [25] to limit the
practice of sending unwanted commercial email in bulk. Not everyone
thinks this is a good idea. See [26] for a thread from an ongoing
debate on Declan McCullagh's fight-censorship mailing list. George
Matyjewicz <mosaic1 at ix dot netcom dot com> did a modest experiment
on a week's worth of his email -- he is on 56 mailing lists and gets
around 200 messages a day -- to gauge how widespread the problem
actually is. Matyjewicz posted these results: 

Total messages...1,354...193.4

Spam messages.......10.......1.4.....< 1 %

Spam complaints....189.......27.0.....14 %

Spam is not crime, it's commerce.  Shut up and hit that delete key, 
you fucktard.

Thanks.
