There are a wide variety of products to do that.
I mainly do ATM, for which there aren't many;  there are a few
for frame relay, and there are lots for private line at low-medium speeds,
e.g. 56kbps through T1 (1.544Mbps), though not too many above T1.
Cylink is a popular vendor.

Also, a number of routers either currently or soon will support crypto;
if you're already using one brand on both ends then you can set up
the crypto features, but if you're doing higher speeds you may have
performance limitations.
				Thanks!
