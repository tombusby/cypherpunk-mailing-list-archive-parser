       Hi.  We are sending you this message to invite you (and, if you 
would like, a few interesting friends) to one of the after-work 
business/social events we sponsor.  Our  Netparty has become 
New York's best-attended event for young professionals.  Over 1,000
people attended our most recent Netparty and over 1,500 are expected
for this week's Thanksgiving Eve Event.

       
WHAT IS A NETPARTY?

      A Netparty is a "networking party" -- an opportunity for young 
professionals to network with each other on a business level (we 
encourage you to exchange business cards) and to interact 
with each other on a social level.  Crain's New York
Business has called networking parties "a genuinely original idea."

      Netparty events are held at Manhattan's hottest nightclubs -- but 
the music is never so loud that you cannot talk and the crowd is 
comprised entirely of young (20's, 30's, 40's) professionals.  We're 
inviting doctors, teachers and entrepreneurs, attorneys, advertising 
executives, actresses, sales professionals, writers, investment bankers 
and many other professionals to our upcoming event.  You may
feel free to forward this e-mail to others who you think may be
interested as well.  

THE NEXT NETPARTIES:
Wednesday, November 25 at Webster Hall
Friday, December 4 at The Roxy
Friday, December 11 (Location To Be Announced)
Friday, December 18 at Creation

	Our next Netparty will take place this Wednesday, November 25.  
For this event, we will be returning to the Grand Ballroom of Webster 
Hall (125 E. 11th St., between 3rd and 4th Aves.) for what we believe 
will be our biggest event of the year -- our Thanksgiving Eve Event. 
Over 1500 people are expected to attend.  In addition to networking 
opportunities, this event will feature a coffee bar, DJ and dancing.  
Doors open at 6 p.m. and you must arrive by 10 p.m to be guaranteed 
admission.  Please note that you are welcome to enjoy Webster Hall 
even after our Netparty ends -- in fact Webster Hall will be holding
a party for Jerry Springer's new movie "Ringmaster" right after our Netparty.   

	Coming in December -- more great network events at New York's 
best nightspots.  Please mark your calendars so that you might join 
us at The Roxy on Friday, December 4 and at our debut at a new 
nightspot -- "Creation" -- on Friday, December 18.  We will also 
hold an event on Friday, December 11;  however the location for 
that event has not yet been finalized.

ADMISSION, DRESS CODE, AGES

      Admission to our events is only $8 at the door.  It is not 
necessary to make a reservation, just show up!  Please note that 
for the Wednesday, November 25 Thanksgiving Eve Event at Webster 
Hall, you must arrive by 10 p.m to be guaranteed admission.  

	No jeans or sneakers are permitted at our events and business 
attire or "Friday casual" attire is requested.  You must be 21 to 
attend. The event is designed for those in their 20's, 30's and 40's; 
the majority of attendees are in their 20's and 30's.
