No, actually they aren't. I have no connection with the Von Mises institute,
either.

However, if you don't want to shell out big bucks for an archival quality
version (and help a good cause in the process) you should at least go to your
library, and, if they don't have a (not-so spiffy :-)) version of von Mises'
_Human Action_ there, you should have them Inter-Library loan it for you.

Another great book in the same vein, actually better, as a first read, is
Friedrich Hayek's _The Road to Serfdom_. Another famous 50-year old book,
pissed upon by statists and leftists for generations, and only now being seen
as one of the best economic books of the century. The most recent edition even
has a forward by Milton Freidman. (Hayek won the Nobel just like Freidman did,
but I don't remember if von Mises did.)

Austrian-school economists rule, d00dz. Enjoy!

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
