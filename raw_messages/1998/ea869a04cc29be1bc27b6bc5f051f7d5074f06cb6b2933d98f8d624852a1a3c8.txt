Correct me if I am wrong or if this has changed since they went
open-source, but AFAIK Mozilla's Windows and Unix codebases were
entirely independent and separately developed, so I'm not sure what
conclusions you can draw from that.

Again, let's leave the OS wars off this list. I've had NT machines up
for several months and down only for patches and upgrades.

But Netscape pissed me off so severely during the version 2.x plethora
of releases with their alpha-quality javascript that I've not used it
since, so I cannot comment on its current [in]stability.
