On July 10, 1998 QX-Tools 4.0 Won "Best of Show" at MacWorld.

Here's what they've been talking about....

Extensis QX-Tools gets the most out of QuarkXPress 4.0 by putting 
your creative ideas to work - faster. QX-Tools 4.0 incorporates 8 
different tools that use the familiar interfaces you already know. 
Spend your time designing, not learning new software.

With NEW QX-VectorEdit, convert any PostScript file into an editable 
Quark object. Word tables, Excel charts, Illustrator, FreeHand, and 
PDF files now become Quark objects.  Edit them, correct them, trap 
them or fix their colors - right in QuarkXPress. Once edited, assign 
the object to a layer with QX-Layers. Yes, layers ARE possible in 
QuarkXPress.  Create, show, hide, reorder and assign any object to 
any layer in your document.

Improved QX-Scaler lets you size and resize groups of objects - with 
precision- without ever losing the option to undo. Once applied, you 
can change any of the object attributes with NEW QX-ItemStyles.  
Create and apply item styles to OBJECTS- using over 50 different 
attributes.  Now, quickly navigate through your documents with 
QX-Viewer, a full-color, multi-spread preview. Then, apply the same 
QX-ItemStyle to objects throughout your document for speed and 
consistency.

With three other useful tools-QX-FineTune (tweak characters and 
objects), QX-Palettes (they're dockable!) and QX-Find-Change (search 
and replace for objects by attribute)-QX-Tools will put your creative 
ideas to work in QuarkXPress- in no time.

Now, make QuarkXPress 4.0 work the way you REALLY want - with 
Extensis QX-Tools 4.0.
