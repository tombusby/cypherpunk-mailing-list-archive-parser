 Comment: 

 The British government is way ahead of every other nation in facing up to
the implications of y2k. 

 It is obvious the the U.S. military is preparing for martial law in late
1999, but no official publicly admits that this is the case. 

 The British are more forthright.

 TROOPS may be on the streets in the year 2000 under emergency Home Office
plans to maintain vital services which could be crippled by the millennium
computer bug. 

 Armed forces will be on standby to help councils and police provide
disaster relief if key infrastructures such as hospitals, water supplies
and roads are hit by the electronic change. 

 The Home Office confirmed yesterday that local authorities are being
encouraged to draw up contingency plans to deal with the "nightmare
scenario" of failed traffic lights, disabled water pumping stations, fuel
shortages and other disrupted services. 

 The bug, which represents the inability of most computers and electronic
systems to deal with the change of date from 1999 to 2000, could also hit
vital equipment in hospitals, lifts, benefits payments and phone lines. 

 Most computer experts believe that major failures are unlikely, but
councils, which have a statutory duty to provide emergency relief, have
been told to prepare for the worst. They will be allowed to use the Armed
Forces Military Aid to Civil Authorities Act to call in emergency help. . . . 

 Rail, telecommunications, gas and electricity regulators were joined by
BT, Shell, Transco and Trailtrack to agree ways to reassure the public that
their computers were being adapted to avoid the bug. . . . 

 In one key sanction, BT and Cable and Wireless have been told they will be
given the power to disconnect firms that corrupt phone connections. . . . 

 Home Secretary Jack Straw is ultimately responsible for emergency planning
as chairman of a body called the Civil Contingencies Committee. The Home
Office Emergency Planning Division will meet this month to firm its own
proposals.
