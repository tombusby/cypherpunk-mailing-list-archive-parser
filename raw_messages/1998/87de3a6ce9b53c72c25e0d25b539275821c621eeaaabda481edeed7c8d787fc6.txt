Would you really call the EU protocols a democracy? rule by the 
unelected technocrats?  And Europes history of not making decisions in 
secret closed meetings is hardly commendable.  Excepting perhaps the 
swiss.

Now my understanding of european law is, of course, limited.  But in 
France wasn't there that case of some rapper been arrested for insulting 
the police?  And in Germany you can strip the constitutional rights of 
citizens who engage in treasonous behaviour ( could this include 
cryptography? if connected with neo-nazis almost certainly right? )

What about those airline accords where the EU took its member states to 
court over cabotage agreements.  I'm sure there are ways to sneak these 
things through.

I'm afraid that that may not be the point.  The primary objective of the 
arms control laws ( which are the ones being used as references in this 
case ) is to prevent advanced weapons technology from spreading to the 
third world.  Now Europe, America, Japan, and other first world 
countries are all capable of developing high level crypto indiginously.  
The less advanced countries on the earth are forced to import it from 
these countries.  What the passage of this law will do is prevent this 
export ( example:  the Netherlands, as you pointed out has not cracked 
down on its internal narcotics trade.  However it doesn't permit 
exporting narcotics.  Similarly this agreement will probably freeze 
exports of high level crypto by all the signatory countries, in the same 
way that america no longer permits high level crypto exports. )
The end result being the NSA should able to read India and Chinas 
communications without irritations.
