Information on New Cellular Battery

Hi:

If you or a loved one has ever missed making or receiving a call on your Motorola Cellular Flip
Phone because your battery lost power, you definitely want the All Day Battery from HITEC
Group at http://www.alldaybattery.com. (If you don't have a Motorola Flip Phone or if you have
a digital cellular phone this info is not for you.)

The All Day Battery provides:

1.  Extended Life: Minimum 5 hours of talk time and 36 hours of standby time on the oldest
phones.  Newer phones (more efficient) will get substantially more talk & standby time. 

2.  Patented Technology: The All Day Battery uses patented technology to protect it during the
charging cycle and to insure you that you get the maximum charge the battery will hold.

3.  Power Gauge: This battery has a true gauge display of the power left in the battery.  Standard
battery life indicators on cell phones only tells you that there is a voltage level in the battery - you
may get a level 5 reading and the battery could lose total power in the next instant.

4.  Battery Protection - The worst thing you can do to a battery is charge it.  During the charging
process other batteries are damaged or destroyed by heat and overcharging.  The All Day Battery
is protected from damage and the accurate power gauge tells you when it is fully charged.  All
other batteries try to protect against damage by never fully charging.

5.  Two(2) Year Warranty: A "No Hassle" two-year warranty is part of every All Day Battery.

Cell phones are critical for personal safety and are heavily used for important business activities. 
The All Day Battery is only $99.00 and provides security and functionality value that goes way
beyond that cost.  You can order direct on the Internet via a Verisign Secure site at
http://www.alldaybattery.com.
