OK here's some more keys:

[1] for "Magic Circle"

[2] for "Necessarily Knott, ME"

Again were these keys used to sign anything interesting?

Key [1] was preceeded, perhaps meaningfully by this text in the long
(22k) Epilogue 5:

: Now:
: 
: Go home, kick your fucking door in, place a disk in the floppy drive, and
: type 'pgp -kxa "My KeyID" a:\secring.asc secring.pgp'.
: Mail the disk to Louis J. Freeh
: 
: Does your copy of PGP ask for a password before spitting out the KeyID
: to any one of a thousand monkeys who sits at your keyboard and
: randomly types in the above?
: 
: My copy doesn't.
: 
: Below is a copy of a key pulled off of my computer by 19 different people.
: 
: It was pulled off of my hard drive by the first individual, who
: proceeded to inform a second individual of the method used, and
: challenged them to do the same thing, using a different method. The
: second did so, and passed all the information along to a third person,
: etc., etc.
: 
: Nineteen people, nineteen different methods.

if Toto apparently speaks in parables, and via fiction etc. is he
saying that the RCMP or someone else pulled his keys off his
computers?  How does this correlate with his posts on the subject of
hassles with the RCMP, and confiscation of some of his machines?
