Just curious what your reaction would be to that ambiguous statement.

Having done DA support, I expect you are quite serious
about heading the other way to give users security
and anonymity. How do you justify both, since the
"bad guys" would benefit?

It's the other stuff: that you flit around (people posting "Where
are you Jalon Q. Zimmerman?"), that The Digital Society doesn't
have its own domain, but is hosted by some other company called
"OpenWorld", which has AOL contact addresses...

Who is Mark Frazier, who owns OpenWorld, how long has it been in
business, what is your relationship to them, what is your job
description? Is OpenWorld another startup that is going to go <poof>?

The OpenWorld pages read like any other company BS, and you've
given yourself the lofty title "Director".

Yeah, and we have Sir Timothy May, Dr. Dim Vulvis, etc.

You're about 26, and full of hot air.

   You mean well. ;-)
