There are 3 distinct threats.

1. communications crypto used by the author in submitting the document
   is broken

2. the eternity architecture contains encrypted documents to frustrate
   attempts to locate documents, and to hide the contents of documents
   from individual servers

3. communications crypto used to request and deliver documents is
   broken thus revealing the readers identity

For threat 1. the attacker needs archives of old communications which
could potentially be eternity submissions.  (I say potentially because
they could be steganographically encoded).  It is probably reasonable
to assume that the NSA has a full historic archive of USENET.  Also it
is probably reasonable to assume they have a historic archive of all
inter remailer traffic.

For threat 2. it seems feasible to upgrade this security over time, in
that documents could be super encrypted with newer ciphers when
vulnerabilities are found in older ciphers.  No protection for
historic access requests, but at least we can adapt to protect new
requests.

For threat 3. again newer ciphers can be used as attacks are found.


So it is useful to design upgrade paths for ciphers into the protocols
where possible.

Other approaches we could take are to use very conservative cipher key
sizes and protocols combining multiple ciphers in ways which gives us
the security of the best of the ciphers.

For example:

	R = random, C = 5DES( R ) || blowfish-484( M xor R )

Where 5DES is say E-D-E-D-E with 5 independent DES keys.

Constructs to combine in strong ways hash functions, macs, symmetric
and asymmetric ciphers would be useful.  Is there much research in
this area?
