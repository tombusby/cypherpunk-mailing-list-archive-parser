Woah there cowboy, just exactly how the hell do you jump from economics to
privacy...talk about a strawman.

Abuse is the nature of man, not economics, privacy, government systems, etc.
They're things, they have no desire and most definitely have no concept of
privacy, economics, duty, etc. A a person or persons are abused it's by
another person or persons.

It depends on the regulation and how it's applied. You simply can't
equitably apply the statement that all regulation is bad because it's equaly
clear that no regulation has its own pitfalls and abuses.

> Being bound by the law of economics is generally a good thing.

Yes, provided you have 'fair competition' which you can't in a free market.
Provided all companies and their management operate within some sort of
ethical guidelines, which they won't (and don't). And on and on.
