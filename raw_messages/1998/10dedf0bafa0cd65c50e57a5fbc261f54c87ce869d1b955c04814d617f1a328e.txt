     Hi, my name is Brian Crawford, and I have tried just about every work- 
at-home opportunity out there, from stuffing envelopes to assembling 
miniatures. Most of them turned out to be nothing more than a waste
of time and money. However, among all the scams and rip-offs, I did
come across many legitimate companies willing to pay for my services.

     I started to think, "Why doesn't someone just keep track of all the 
honest companies so that no one else would need to get ripped off
when trying to find a decent work-at-home job?" I decided to do just 
that.
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT SIZE=3><I>
Throw Away That Junk Mail!
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=2></I>
     See, the reason most of us encounter problems is because we usually
look for these jobs by responding to junk mail. Let me ask you, when was 
the last time an employer sent you a job offering in the mail? Probably never!
You had to look for the job yourself, and it is exactly the same with 
work-at-home positions. The companies are out there, but you need to look 
for them. That is where my book "The Home Workers Survival Guide" really 
comes in handy.
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT SIZE=3><I>
Over 200 Companies Waiting to Hear from You!
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=2></I>
     In chapter three, you will find page after page of job listings for all
kinds of work. Find something you like, and then contact them at the 
address listed. You could be on your way to a great paying at-home 
job for the cost of a stamp. Never send in $20-$30 for a bogus 
"processing fee" again! Anyone in the U.S. can work- no one is
refused.
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT SIZE=3><I>

get started right away. These companies offer legitimate work and will 
be happy to send you full information before you make a decision. 
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT SIZE=3><I>
Watch Out For Scams!
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=2></I>
     Chapter four will let you in on some of the most common work-at
home scams. Make sure you read this. If you come across something
that sounds too good to be true, remember- it probably is. Here are
just two quick examples of information found in this chapter.

1.<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> "Assemble Miniatures"<FONT COLOR="#000000"> If a company requires a large deposit or
registration fee to get started but promises great pay, be careful. Most 
legitimate companies will charge only a small fee for the supplies they 
send you, and wil pay you a reasonable amount as well. After sending
in a large payment, you may find that the company will call your
finished work "inferior" and refuse to pay you. They were only after 
your registraion fee, and probably never intended on paying you. 

2. <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">"Stuff Envelopes"<FONT COLOR="#000000"> Nobody is going to pay you a dollar or even 50
cents to stuff an envelope. There are machines that can stuff
thousands of envelopes a day for only pennies. What these companies 
should really tell you is that you will be mailing junk advertisements 
for them. They expect you to place an ad in your local newspaper 
offering "Home Workers Needed". You only get the "dollar per 
envelope" when people actually reply to this ad!
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT SIZE=3><I>
Are They All Bogus?
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=2></I>
     Like I said before, there are a lot of dishonest companies out there 
looking to take your money, but not all of them are like that. We list 
over 40 companies offering assembly work, from toys to clothes to 
weaving rattan. Choose the kind of work you like and write to the 
companies who offer it. Ask them any questions you have BEFORE 
you send in any money or buy any supplies. 

     There are also several companies out there that will pay you a 
substantial commission for mailing their advertisements, and you 
won't have to pay them anything to be able to do it, just contact them 
and ask!
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT SIZE=3><I>
     Need Cash Fast?
48 Hours Soon Enough?
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=2></I>
     When you get the book, look over the many excellent opportunities.
Each listing includes a brief description of what is offered. Write to the 
companies you like and request an application form. They have 
openings right now, and they'll be happy to get you started.  

     You can begin to make money even faster if you choose one of the 
programs or plans that the book describes in detail. I'll tell you 
everything you need to know to get started. By taking a few simple 
steps, you can already be making money just 48 hours after you receive 
the book.
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT SIZE=3><I>

                                                                                        Sincerely, 
                                                                              
                                                                                        <I>Brian Crawford</I>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">P.S.<FONT COLOR="#000000"> I've just added some great new information to the book. Some 
people are already making as much as $3000 a week with a new 
program that lets them work in the comfort of their own home. It 
costs nothing to get started and anyone can do it. It's like nothing I 
have ever seen before, and it is sure to make people a lot of money.
Details will be rushed to you along with your book order.
