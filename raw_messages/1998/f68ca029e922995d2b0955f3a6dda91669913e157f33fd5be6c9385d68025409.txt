And always will...Sorry, nothing gets the point across like a good
vulgarity

I have been on for about a week...My welcome message got no replys, all I
seam to get are political messages, I have seen one question about
crypto, and the reply was half joke...I DO NOT HAVE NET ACCESS!  how do I
get pgp with out net access...I just wanted to know what everyone else
was useing...What is up with J-Dog jumping my shit (sorry) with this
stuff about, "Then again, if I was to say linux to you, you would prolly
run in ph33r"?  I know linux, I want linux, you have read the other posts
so I won't go into it...I guess i am just on the wrong list...I sent out
a post befor about are there any better 'newbie' lists on crypto but got
no responce...oh well.

		D.

p.s, I like Juno... :(
