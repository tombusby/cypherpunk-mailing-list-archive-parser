"A cultist is one who has a strong belief in the Bible and the Second
Coming of Christ; who frequently attends Bible studies; who has a high
level of financial giving to a Christian cause; who home schools for
their children; who has accumulated survival foods and has a strong
belief in the Second Amendment; and who distrusts big government.  Any
of these may qualify [a person as a cultist] but certainly more than one
[of these] would cause us to look at this person as a threat, and his
family as being in a risk situation that qualified for government
interference."
-Attorney General Janet Reno, Interview on 60 Minutes, June 26, 1994
