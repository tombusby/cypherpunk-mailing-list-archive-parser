Of course I have issues!  That felcher Harald Fragner led me to believe
that through him, he would get me hooked up with Monica Lewinsky
through this six degrees thing!  I hear she really loves to party with
the geek-set!  That mother humper actually made me send him a
check in exchange for her private info, after which he takes me out
of his contact info!

I tell you what, it's monkey spankers like Harald Fragner that make this
six degrees service a real sham.  These toe fungus kissers need to be
taken out of six degrees!  I'm going to contact my congressman and
tell him to watch out for the likes of a camel snot taster like Harald
Fragner, if that's even his real name.  And I'm telling him to watch out
for you guys too!  You just watch it, you gerbil tubers!  You cheese
whiz fondlers!  You purveyors of cottage cheese and farm animals!
The government knows what you're up to!

Sincerely,
Joe Cypherpunk, dissatisfied customer at large
