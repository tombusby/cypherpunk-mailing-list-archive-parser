How about a government employee taking part in political discussion
without the fear of suffering some form of reprisal by their elected
superiors?

How about a gay person that's still in the closet that wants to discuss
how to explain their situation to their family without the fear that
their sexual preference would be exposed?

How about those that are HIV positive looking for support while living in
a small town that is very afraid of those with HIV, and where the
knowledge that one is HIV positive has driven people from the community?

How about someone that feels they may be getting sexually harassed but
isn't sure that they want to confront their harasser, but wants some
advice?

How about a rape, incest, or domestic violence victim that is looking for
some support group but doesn't want to go public yet?

How about the alcoholic, drug user, gambler trying to come to terms with
their problem.  How about the relatives of those with that type of
problem that are looking for a private way to deal/handle the problems
associated with their relative's problem?

How about the runaway that is looking for a way to go home, or the
suicidal person that is looking for help.  Must they go public to
get that help, or should they be able to ask questions anonymously?

How about the person that wants to turn in someone that's going to
commit a crime?

There are lots of good reasons that people want privacy and anonymity,
and lots of them have to do with the prejudices of others about the
issue that the person wants to keep private.
