>     Today's News Let's pie! Let's pie! Nincompoop guys!
>    by Hugues Henry   February 9, 1998
>    
>         Until last week, Noel Godin was relatively unknown in the United
>    States. A 52-year-old Belgian author, film historian, actor ("The
>    Sexual Life of the Belgians"), writer ("Cream and Punishment") and
>    "entarteur" (a Godin coinage that roughly translates as "encaker" or
>    "pie-er"), Godin led the gang that gave to Bill Gates what so many of
>    us only dream of: a big wet pie in the face. The attack took place at
>    the entrance of Le Concert Noble on Arlon Street in Brussels and was
>    widely reported in the press.
>    
>         Godin doesn't own a computer and didn't even know what a URL is.
>    His girlfriend, however, uses a PC. (This interview was conducted and
>    translated by Hugues Henry.)
>    
>    The Netly News: Who are you, Noel Godin?
>    
>    Noel Godin: I'm part of a gang of bad hellions that have declared the
>    pie war on all the unpleasant celebrities in every kind of domain
>    (slogan: "Let's pie! Let's pie! Nincompoop guys!"). We began to act
>    against "empty" celebrities from the artistic world who were thinking
>    they were the cat's whiskers. Then we attacked the TV news business in
>    France, for instance, Patrick Poivre D'Arvor [a famous French TV
>    presenter]. Then it became political with Philippe Douste-Blazy in
>    Cannes, the French minister of culture, or the other French minister
>    Nicolas Sarkozy last year in Brussels.
>    
>    NN When did you first pie someone?
>    
>    Godin: In November 1969, with French writer Marguerite Duras, who
>    represented for us the "empty" novel.
>    
>    NN Why did you choose Bill Gates?
>    
>    Godin: Because in a way he is the master of the world, and then
>    because he's offering his intelligence, his sharpened imagination and
>    his power to the governments and to the world as it is today -- that
>    is to say gloomy, unjust and nauseating. He could have been a utopist,
>    but he prefers being the lackey of the establishment. His power is
>    effective and bigger than that of the leaders of the governments, who
>    are only many-colored servants. So Bill Gates was at the top of our
>    lists of victims. The attack against him is symbolic, it's against
>    hierarchical power itself. Our war cry was explicit: "Let's pie! Let's
>    pie the polluting lolly!"
