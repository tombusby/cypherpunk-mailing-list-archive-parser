Hi Cypherpunks and e$-ers.

After having read Adleman's Sci Am article, I couldn't help but ask him...  :-)

Subject: Re: Your article in Scientific American and RSA

Thank you for the kind words regarding the Sci Am article. I have thought about
using DNA for breaking cryptosystems. It does appear convievable that a code like
DES could be broken. However, because RSA can simply increase the size of keys to
overcome whatever computing power DNA provides, I do not think it represents a
threat to RSA.

We of course have a long way to go to see whether we can actually get DNA to live
up to its potential.

If you are unfamiliar with quantum computation I think you might enjoy reading
about it - it, at least in theory, could represent a threat to RSA. I believe that
you can find info on the www.
