Well, kind of. If some public figure comes up before the nation and says
quietly "I did not have sex with Brenda the Barber," that's one thing. 

If the same public figure goes under oath and then lies, it's another. In
the first case, he's exercising freedom of speech, though there could be
some argument as to whether somebody in a public office has the right to
lie like that. In the second case, he's trying to throw a wrench in the
justice system. It wouldn't be as bad if somebody like Jim or I lied under
oath, but this guy is the chief executive of the United States. He's
basically Top Cop, and his administration doesn't hesitate to press
charges against people who commit all sorts of victimless crimes.

Actually, the amazing thing is that you're from AOL. You're coherent, you
quote, and you know how to use a remailer. One in a million. ;)
