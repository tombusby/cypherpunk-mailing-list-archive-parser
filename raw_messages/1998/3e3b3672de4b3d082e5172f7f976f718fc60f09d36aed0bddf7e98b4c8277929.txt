You print 1000 certificates for bananas, and require the camel to accept them.
Then you make him carry all 3000 across the desert.  Then you print three
million
certificates, and declaring his certificates devalued, hand him three
bananas, one of which you keep as income tax.  You also keep half a banana
in banana-transfer-taxes.
