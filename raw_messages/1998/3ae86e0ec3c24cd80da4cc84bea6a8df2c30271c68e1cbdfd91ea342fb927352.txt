Is that to speed it up, so you don't have to initialize it by spinning
through a bunch of initial iterations?  Turns out there's a time-memory
tradeoff, where if you do a recursion relationship on where you want it
to start, you can set it up in log2 time and come out with the same
starting point you would have by spinning: the recursion equations
cancel nicely and it boils down to something manageable.  I think other
people have initialized it with another PRNG with good success.

I <know> that's not classified, since I came up with the recursion
shortly after the Lewis & Payne paper on GFSR came out -- JACM, wasn't
it?  I never got around to writing it up.
