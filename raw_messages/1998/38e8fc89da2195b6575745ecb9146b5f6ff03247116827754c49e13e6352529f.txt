How's it going to get there? The ex_president certainly won't appeal (and
face removal from office) and since Congress passed it they likely won't
appeal.

Besides the Constitution says that Congress must stop at removal from office
and barring from future offices. It is clearly within their power to simply
slap his hand or write him a bad report card.
