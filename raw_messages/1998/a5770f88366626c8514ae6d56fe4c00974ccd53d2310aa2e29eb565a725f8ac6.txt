 Exactly, to lump all mass emailers into one homogenous category is all
wrong. I subscribe to a list people running Mac Performa series 
PowerPCs (almost all PPC 603/e)/v). We recently had someone who had
apparently subscribed to the list and lurked and built up a mailing list
of posters to the list to whom he later sent a solicitation ... it was
quite appropriate and as targetted as you can get, active participants
in a highly specific group ... you shopuld have heard the weeping an
gnashing of teeth ... the bandwidth comsumed by compliants was a
thousand fold greater than the solicitation itself!

 SPAM is the boogeyman of the hour. Yes there are bad spammers out there
and a modest knowledge of your mail client will handle 95% of them
straight to File 13, but I really do want to receive many of the
solicitations I get, I actually do buy things ...

 Just my .02
