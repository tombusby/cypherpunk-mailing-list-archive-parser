                     Pentagon Takes Back Hack
                     Wired News Report

                     7:45 p.m.  1.Oct.98.PDT
                     The US Department of Defense said
                     Thursday last week's report of crackers
                     penetrating military Web sites and
                     altering soldiers' medical files were
                     inaccurate.

                     Instead, a "Red Team" of American
                     military computer experts carried out a
                     simulated attack designed to test the
                     security of the Pentagon's computer
                     networks, said a spokeswoman for the
                     Defense Department.

                     "The simulated attack is part of the
                     recent exercises to assess the danger to
                     unclassified material, such as personnel
                     records," Suzan Hansen said Thursday.

                     The confusion arose last week, when
                     Money told the Armed Forces
                     Communications and Electronics
                     Association Conference that crackers had
                     accessed a medical database in the
                     southeastern United States and changed
                     blood types in soldiers' records.

                     Hansen said that Money was merely
                     referring to a Red Team exercise, not a
                     real cyberattack.

                     At the conference, Money reportedly said
                     that the Red Team exercise prompted the
                     Pentagon to develop a more restrictive
                     security policy on the type of information
                     that will be stored in military computers
                     connected to the Internet.
