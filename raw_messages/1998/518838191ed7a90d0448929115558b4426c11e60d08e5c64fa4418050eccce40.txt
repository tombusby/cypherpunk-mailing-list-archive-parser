Dave points out that this was Schneier, Hall and Kelsey.

	It arises in a different context; with a signature on paper,
you're generally indicating that you've read and consented to whats on
the paper, not that you created it.  The meaning of a camera signing a
video still is not obvious to me.  Is it intended to be 'this is what
we saw through the lens?' or 'this is what really happened?'
