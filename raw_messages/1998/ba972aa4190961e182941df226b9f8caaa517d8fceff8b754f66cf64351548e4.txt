Um, actualy no. Since the photons are coupled we know that the second photon
has actualy changed it's polarization, either that or your original
assumption they are coupled is not true. The polarization between the two
photons *must* be zero. Otherwise you arent' playing with our physics.

Correlation is not a function of any quantity conservation operation.
The values of the photons are actualy opposite and therefore sum to zero.
Foo is not the inverse of Bar, as is the case for horizontal and vertical
polarization.

True, but the swap of polarization was *not*. That occured later and is what
changes instantly irrespective of distance.

Yes, it causes the correlation to be destroyed. You are not taking into
account the correllation or polarization dependency between the two photons.
Our base assumption is that when photon A is horizontal then photon B is
vertical. This *must* occur to preserve symmetry.
