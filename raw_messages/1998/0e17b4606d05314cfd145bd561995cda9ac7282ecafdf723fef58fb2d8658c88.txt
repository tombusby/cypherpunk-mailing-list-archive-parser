The conference schedule and additional information is available at the
URL http://www.cwi.nl/conferences/FC98/.

Breakfast and lunch are provided at the conference.  The conference
organizers have left time open for corporate sponsored events, for
networking, and for recreational activities on the resort island of
Anguilla.  Participants are encouraged to bring their families.


Workshop:

A 40-hour workshop, intended for anyone with commercial software
development experience who wants hands-on familiarity with the issues
and technology of financial cryptography, is planned in conjunction
with FC98, to be held during the week following the conference.

For more information on the workshop, please see the URL
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~iang/fc98/workshop.html.

For workshop registration, see the URL http://fc98.ai/.


Special Attraction:

On Thursday, February 26, 1998, there will be a total eclipse of the
sun.  The narrow zone of 100% totality will pass just south of
Anguilla.  A boat excursion to the center of the eclipse zone is
planned, for an optimal view of the eclipse.  The excursion is
included in the conference registration; additional tickets can be
purchased for accompanying persons.


Venue:

The Inter-Island Hotel is a small 14-room guest house with a large,
comfortable 150-seat conference facility and additional space for a
small 10-booth exhibition.  The Inter-Island is on Road Bay, near
Sandy Ground Village, in the South Hill section of Anguilla.  The
conference, workshop, and exhibition will have TCP/IP internet access.
Shuttle service to the conference will be available.


Air Transportation and Hotels:

Air travel to Anguilla is typically done through San Juan for US
flights, or St. Maarten/Martin for flights from Europe and the US.
There are also connections via Antigua.

Anguillan import duties are not imposed on hardware or software which
will leave the island again. There are no other taxes--or cryptography
import/export restrictions--on Anguilla.

Hotels range from spartan to luxurious, and more information about
hotels on Anguilla can be obtained from your travel agent, or at the
URL http://fc98.ai/.  A block reservation has been made at Mariners,
and this is the recommended hotel except for those seeking budget
accomodations.
