True, but since when is freedom of speech, association, and press related to
wired (or you) making a profit?

I feel zero social responsibility to tell people to go there and read it
when I can send a snippet of it to them directly and save them the time,
effort, and bandwidth. I personaly absolutely *HATE* to recieve a piece of
email that contains nothing but a URL, it's worthless - lacks all context.

Don't like folks sending partial or whole articles to foster discussion,
learn to love it or live with it.
