The company used to be called Comsec. http://www.comsec.com/ They've
expanded and are working on the next revision of the product. The old
version was $750 each. The new version will be a lot less expensive. When
you call, ask for Eric Blossom. (831) 333-9393  x12

Starium's current generation phone encryption device, the GSP8191,
performs a 2048 bit DH key exchange to establish a 3DES session key. Each
party then reads out half of the hash. If the hashes match, you know that
you are not subject to an MIM attack. The system has perfect forward
secrecy. Thumb screws will have no effect. :-)
