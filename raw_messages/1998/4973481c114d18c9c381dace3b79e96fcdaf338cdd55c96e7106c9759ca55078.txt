I agree in principle. I also believe though that the people who are taking
advantage of the peoples character (it's mentioned in the Declaration of
Indipendance) do so in a pre-meditated way. The people may bear some blame
but they're not doing it out of malice and malpheasance.

It's like those punk kids dressed in leather, tatoos, and pierced body parts
yammering about being different, yet they all look the same.

I agree. Though I don't believe it necessarily requires the majority to do
it. If it does then we may be doomed before we even start. As long as the
government recognizes in any shape, form, or fashion that majority rule is
limited by individual rights there is a chance that a small group dedicated
and forthright can overcome.

God, ain't that the truth. I'm drowning in the damn books trying to keep up
with just a couple of my personal interests.
