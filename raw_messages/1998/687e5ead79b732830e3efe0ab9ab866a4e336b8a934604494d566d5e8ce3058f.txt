Hi --

We would like to thank you for your download of an HVS Series demo. First,
we apologize to those of you who received multiple copies of a recent
mailing from us as a result of our email server meltdown. We've now
implemented an email notification system that should prevent such woeful
circumstances from happening again. If you don't wish to receive more
information about Digital Frontiers special offers please reply to
info@digfrontiers.com and ask to be removed.

As a gesture of thanks and appreciation, we would like to offer you a 25%
discount on our HVS Toolkit Pro, which includes the latest versions of the
award-winning HVS ColorGIF, HVS JPEG and HVS Animator Pro, through August
30th 1998. HVS Tooolkit Pro regularly retails at $208 but you may purchase
it for $156 (more than 50% off separate retail prices) for this limited
time only.

Because this offer is only available to demo registrants, it will not be
available on our commerce server. Individual products are available at a
10% discount from our commerce server at
http://www.digfrontiers.com/purchase.html as part of our summer sale. For
product information, please visit http://www.digfrontiers.com, or reply to
this email.

To take advantage of the 25% offer, please email, fax or call us with the
