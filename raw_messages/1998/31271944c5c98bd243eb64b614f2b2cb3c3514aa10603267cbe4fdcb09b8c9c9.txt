I rather doubt that. I have had a Texas drivers license since I was 16, I'm
now 38. I have washed them innumerable times and I have never had the
lamination break or otherwise degrade. The lamination is quite heavy. I did
have one crack at the seam one time because of a bad lamination and was
specificaly instructed by the officer who wrote me a speeding ticket to get
it replaced. I did so immediately. The law here is that if the license is
damaged, you move, or otherwise make the information invalid you have 30
days to correct it. I suspect quite strongly that had I shown up at the court
house to pay that ticket with the same damaged license (required to be shown
at the time of payment) they would not have accepted the payment and might
have asked to to discuss the situation with one of the officers they so
thoughtfuly have placed about the room.

Texas takes counterfeiting of licenses quite seriously.

My suggestion would be don't try such juvenile tricks here, the DPS have
seen it before and won't be pleasant people to deal with unless you're
a juvenile.

I have a proposal. Lucky is supposed to be in Austin for the CFP conference.
If he is agreeable, he could ask to examine a Tx. d.l. We could leave it up
to his opinion as to whether these would be easy to alter.
