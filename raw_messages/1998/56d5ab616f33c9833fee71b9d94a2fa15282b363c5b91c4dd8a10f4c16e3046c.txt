Introducing Extensis PhotoFrame for Adobe Photoshop Users 
http://products.extensis.com/PhotoFrame/

Remember when building a creative image edge was a headache?  
Those days are over.

Extensis has just released PhotoFrame 1.0, a versatile Photoshop 
plug-in that enables designers to develop customized, professional-
quality image frames and border effects for any image - right in 
Photoshop - in a fraction of the time it used to take.

Volumes 1 and 2 include a collection of hand painted and digitally 
created, professionally-designed borders. Start by viewing the 
keyword-searchable PhotoFrame collection from within the
image browser catalog. Once selected, simply drag the thumbnail 
into PhotoFrame and start using it! 

>From there, customize is the word. Simply and quickly adjust opacity, 
blur and color while the real-time preview shows the changes as you 
make them. You can rotate, flip, invert - or use a combination of up to 
3 separate frames to achieve the desired effect. 

With multiple redo/undo, you can go back and forth as much as 
needed before applying the final effect.  When finished, save your 
customized effect for future use.  

With the speed and versatility of Extensis PhotoFrame, you've got 
the Creative Edge.
