I found what you're looking for.  I failed in my search at the FCC and ARRL web-sites, except for offers to purchase the applicable regulations in hardcopy.

C.F.R. 47, Part 97 covers the Amateur Radio Service.  The full set of regs is available at:

http://www.mv.com/ipusers/simons/al/radio/part97.html

The specific regulation you're looking for is at: 

http://www.mv.com/ipusers/simons/al/radio/part97_b.html#97.113

S 97.113 Prohibited transmissions. 

(a) No amateur station shall transmit: 

...
        (4) Music using a phone emission except as specifically

            provided elsewhere in this Section; communications

            intended to facilitate a criminal act; messages in
                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^
            codes or ciphers intended to obscure the meaning
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            thereof, except as otherwise provided herein;
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            obscene or indecent words or language; or false

            or deceptive messages, signals or identification; 

...

The exception clause probably makes reference to an allowed "code", that being morse code.
