NSA listening practices called European`threat'
European Parliament report accuses agency of widespread spying 

By Neal Thompson 
Sun Staff

The National Security Agency has incurred the wrath of some U.S.
allies and triggered debate about increased global eavesdropping,
thanks to a new report that accuses the agency of spying on
European citizens and companies.

With the help of a listening post in the moors of northern England,
NSA for nearly a decade has been snatching Europe's electronic
communications signals, according to a report for the European
Parliament.

"Within Europe, all e-mail, telephone and fax communications are
routinely intercepted by the United States National Security Agency,
transferring all target information to Fort Meade," said the report.

`Powerful threat'

It warned that the NSA's tactics represent a "powerful threat to civil
liberties in Europe" at a time when more communication -- and
commerce -- is conducted electronically.

A preliminary version of the report circulated overseas in recent
months, touching off heated debate, with front-page stories in Italy,
France, Scotland, England, Belgium and even Russia.

The NSA won't discuss the report or even admit that the listening
post exists.

But this week, two days of debate in the European Parliament
continued the extraordinary public disclosure of comprehensive
post-Cold War spying by the agency. On Wednesday, the
Parliament passed a resolution seeking more accountability from such
eavesdropping arrangements and more assurances that they won't be
misused.

"We want to make sure that somebody's watching them," said Glyn
Ford, a British member of the European Parliament, the legislative
body for the 15-member European Union.

Observers say this was the first time a governmental body has
described in detail -- and then criticized -- the NSA's tactics.

"The cat's well and true out of the bag," said Simon Davies, director
of the London-based watchdog group Privacy International. "I would
argue that we have made the grandest step in 50 years toward
accountability of such national security transparencies."

The report describes a sophisticated program called Echelon, which
the NSA established in conjunction with British intelligence agencies.
The program includes a listening post in Menwith Hill, in Yorkshire,
whose satellite dishes soak up the satellite and microwave
transmissions carrying Europe's telephone conversations, faxes and
e-mail.

Unlike Cold War spying aimed at the military, Echelon is a global
electronic surveillance system that targets individuals, businesses,
governments and organizations, the report says.

The U.S. shares the information with Britain, Canada, Australia and
New Zealand as part of an intelligence-sharing agreement called
UKUSA. Each nation has its own set of key words, so it can seek
information on specific issues, the report states.

Europe is but a fraction of Echelon's target area -- and the Menwith
Hill post is one of at least 10 around the world, the report adds.

"One reason its a bigger deal over there than it is over here [in the
U.S.] is because the SIGINT [signals intelligence] systems are over
their heads and not our heads," said Jeffrey Richelson, an analyst
with the National Security Archives, a U.S. group seeking to
declassify intelligence related documents.

Echelon repercussions

But the disclosure of Echelon could soon resonate across the Atlantic
after the European Parliament action. Furthermore, it could
complicate current negotiations between the U.S. and the European
Union over encryption programs that scramble or encode computer
information, said Parliament member Ford.

The U.S. has been lobbying for back-door access to such codes for
security reasons.
