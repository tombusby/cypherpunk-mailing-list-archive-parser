I've asked many times from the local chapter and the answer was always no. 
The EFF has certainly never offered legal support to anyone in the 8 years
or so they've been in existance, well other than Steve Jackson perhaps (I'm
not sure if the EFF helped defray any of his court costs).

You should look into the history of civil disobedience then. The ONLY time
it works is when it is done via mass involvement. The NAACP and ACLU have
been quite effective within their limited areas of interest.

Your understanding of the history of civil disobedience is skewed at best.

Then you should rethink your approach. Somebody asking to put your neck on
the block while they won't with their own is no contributor. I believe back
in the War of Indipendence THOSE people were called Tory.
