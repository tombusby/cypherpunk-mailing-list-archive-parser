Well, for one.. I don't think (speculation, I haven't done any real
investigation into it yet..) that this oft repeated maxim applies to
modern hi-res monitors with super refresh rates. I don't think that a
TV could be used to display emanations from a new monitor. OTOH, I
haven't looked into modern TV technology at all.. I don't know what
the new sets are really capable of. Suffice it to say, you probably
won't be able to modify an older set to snoop on a new monitor set up
at 1280x1024, but if for experiment purposes to just did a text display
you should be able to snoop that with an older set.

I would think that any device of this sort would make the monitor's 
display rather distorted.. unless you put shielding around it to
protect it, but that same shielding would prevent usable EMR.

Find the Unofficial Tempest Homepage (sorry, dont have the URL handy..
but I found it a few times by searching out the title from altavista)
it has links to Van Eck's original paper, and if memory serves papers
that "fill in" the gaps of Van Eck's work to help in modifying
equipment.
