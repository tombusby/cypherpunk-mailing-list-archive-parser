Except, of course, that *businesses* count as individuals in a 
libertarian world.  Yes, the corporation, that creation wholly of 
government, becomes a sort of super-individual - and of course all 
individuals are equal, but some are just a bit more equal.

When I see a libertarian calling for an elimination of all forms of 
corporations and a return to sole proprietorships and straight 
partnerships as the only form of business, then I'll know he's 
ideologically consistent.  Until then, pro-business is the only 
reasonable way to describe the twisted rationale behind 
libertarianism.

Which brings me back to my original point - the AIM representation at 
the aforementioned hearings.  In Libber-land, there's nothing 
reprehensible there.  Corporations are lobbying for their "individual 
rights", one of them being the right to make maximum profit by 
eliminating/marginalizing competitors.  Of course the rights they are 
lobbying for may infringe on some others' rights, perhaps in schools 
or libraries which receive federal funds, but hey, that's life for 
you.  Every individual has an equal chance.  And after all, freedom 
to speak and receive information is just a preference - some people 
prefer to receive more of it than others.

But very very little time complaining about the *existence* of 
corporations whose primary function is to shield the important folks 
who run and fund the corporation from the consequences of their 
actions.  Come on!  This should be a primary offense!  Individuals 
with no responsibility!

Heavens, Declan, you're right!  All those companies selflessly 
creating a network between universities and defense sites, not 
seeking a return in five years but looking well into the future..... 
Let us praise the foresight of those companies.  What were their 
names again?
