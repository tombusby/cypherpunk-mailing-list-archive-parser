Sure, but that doesn't stop the problem at the other end. According to
the company:

"Messages received from other copies of the 
program are either brought to the attention of the user, or (if the user 
so desires) result in the automatic transmission of a positive response to
the 
other copies of the program, which response causes the other copies of the 
program to 'approve' the user."

This implies that they have some 'magic marker' in the challenge messages
which forces the software to pass it on to the user. In which case, a
spammer can merely add this marker to his messages and they will get
through to anyone who has the software configured that way.

Ditto.

I've seen this problem with other active 'anti-spam' programs on other
lists; it's a real pain in the ass. They say the software handles lists
properly, but who knows?

Exactly; any kind of active anti-spam is a pain in the ass in this
case. I just filter and delete, which gets 95%+ of spam sent to my
account; 3MB in the last nine months, last I checked.
