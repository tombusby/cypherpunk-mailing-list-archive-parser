HUGE SIMULATED TERRORIST ATTACK AIMED AT PUTTING CITY ON GUARD

 From Tribune News Services
 September 17, 1998 

 PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA --
 The Army on Wednesday gave
 Philadelphia's law-enforcement and rescue
 crews a daylong taste of what it might be
 like if terrorists unleashed deadly Sarin
 nerve gas during a civic luncheon for 1,500
 people.

 Sirens shattered the calm of Philadelphia's
 Fairmount Park as hundreds of police,
 firefighters and federal troops rushed to the
 aid of city workers acting out their parts as
 victims of the attack.

 "You can't predict an Oklahoma City. You
 can't predict what happened in Tokyo. And
 you can't predict what happened in New
 York," Army Col. Richard Breen shouted
 over the roar of fire engines. "It's better to
 be proactive and train people so that a city
 like Philadelphia can take . . . care of its
 citizens if, God forbid, something like this
 really were to occur."

 The drill was part of a Defense Department
 program to train cities to cope with
 chemical, biological and nuclear terrorism.
 The exercise, the biggest yet to be staged
 by the Army Chemical and Biological
 Defense Command, involved beat officers,
 bomb-disposal experts, hazardous-material
 teams, firefighters, ambulance crews,
 National Guardsmen, federal emergency
 managers, FBI agents, the Coast Guard and
 the American Red Cross.

 Organizers refused to say how many people
 took part. "We would not want to
 broadcast . . . just what our personnel and
 equipment strengths would be to meet this
 type of emergency," a city official said.

 Later this month in a similar exercise, the
 Army plans to simulate another Sarin attack
 on a music concert at RFK Stadium in
 Washington.
