The sheeple don't care.

The sheeple are well aware of the abuses of power by our government and
they don't care nor have they cared for a long time. So long as they have
a roof over their heads, cloths on their back, a color TV and their
microwave dinners they are willing to let the government do whatever they
want.

Where was the great outcry by the people when the government blatantly
covered up the assassination of JFK with the Warren Commission?

Where was the great outcry by the people with the numerous atrocities
committed by the FBI,CIA,BATF, ...?

Where was the great outcry by the people over the coverup of the murder of
Vince Foster?

Where was the great outcry by the people over the murder of innocent
children at Waco?

They just don't care and this report woun't be so much as a blip on the
radar screen. The Feds will just wrap this up in the cover of fighting the
four horsemen and it will be business as usual.
