You have read and heard the stories in the media, -"COMPUTERS WILL SHUT
DOWN IN THE YEAR 2000!"
What will your computer do when the NEW MILLENNIUM hits??
    I have developed a new program, that will check your computer and give
you the results in just a few short minutes! It is simple to run ,easy to
understand and very affordable. There is no need to take your computer into
a computer service depot to get the same results, that would probably cost
you 100's of dollars more! You will now be armed with the info you need to
know,  if only a simple BIOS upgrade is  needed! Believe me when I tell you,
a lot of computer service depots are going to get rich, in trying to
convince you that you either need a new computer or a full upgrade is
necessary!!
    Our software will show you at a glance what your computer's capabilities
are, it will give you the required recommendations of what you should and
can't do    The software is available two ways - The simple easy way is by
file
attached email. You just copy the file to a floppy disk and run it. If you
prefer the program be sent to you already on 31/2 or 51/4 floppy, the cost
is slightly more.


Cost of software............$20.00 US funds - Email (file attached) make
sure you include your email address!!!
                                        $25.00 US funds - floppy disk -
(please specify)

All funds to be in US dollars only and to be paid by Postal Money Order or
Cash.
Please include self-addressed stamped envelope for software on floppies.

Due to the overwhelming response we have been experiencing so far, please
allow one week for the email file and two to three weeks for the floppies.
