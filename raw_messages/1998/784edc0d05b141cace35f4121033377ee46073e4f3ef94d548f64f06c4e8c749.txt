I'd say the obvious answer is to buy a spammers mailing list and then use
it to send out a one-time-only missive on the issues with a directive of
where to go for more information. Mass email letters to newspapers all over
the US (or whereever you are). Hit usenet with copies. Buy add space in
newspapers and magazines. Hit up the local media for PSA's. Use the local
public access television stations. etc.

It's not the how that people are having a hard time with, it's the why.
