INVISIMAIL INTERNATIONAL LTD. ANNOUNCES RPK InvisiMail VERSION 3.0

New York, NY, October 21 1998 - InvisiMail International, Ltd., (www.InvisiMail.com) announced today the latest release of its RPK InvisiMail Intro 3.0 and RPK InvisiMail Deluxe 3.0 e-mail encryption products. RPK InvisiMail provides individual e-mail users with the easiest solution for automatically and transparently encrypting e-mail messages and attachments. The first e-mail security product with globally strong encryption, RPK InvisiMail integrates seamlessly with more e-mail products than any other security solution available today. RPK InvisiMail enables authentication of the sender and verifies contents have not been changed in transit.

RPK InvisiMail Intro provides fast, secure (607bit) encryption for e-mail messages and attachments, and is unobtrusive allowing e-mail which is sent to non-InvisiMail users to be simply and intelligently passed as a conventional e-mail message.  RPK InvisiMail Deluxe adds an even higher level of security (up to 1279bit) and provides features such as e-mail compression that reduces transmission time, and digital message signatures to validate senders.
 
InvisiMail International also offers RPK InvisiMail Enterprise Edition, a strong corporate e-mail security add-in. RPK InvisiMail Enterprise Edition's flexible design allows corporate IT managers to configure e-mail security for individual users, networks and gateways.
