    let's see, the banks other than the select few bankers' banks and
    the Rockefeller-Rothschild central bank cartels are out 'n' billion,
    but that only represents an infinitesimal fraction of the middle class
    loss since it's paper to the banks, but life savings to the middle class.

    Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea --the pet tigers of the US-Brit
    money cartels all propped up, but actually setup by the IMF and their
    rules which destroy their infrastructure in favour of the cartel.
    suckers one, suckers all.

    Japan started it all with their economic isolation, multi-level
    cronyism, state sponsored economic terror, and scientific cannibalism.
    Japan sits on 50% crony-deals and the banks are falling like dominoes,
    but Japan today is Japan for centuries; they wont take their medicine.

    The Arabs are in hock up to their headbands and real income in
    Saudi Arabia has fallen from 14,000 in 1991 to less than 4,000
    today...  but, now they wont fight each other as they found the 
    common unifier as the Tomahawk IIs crashed into Sudan and 
    Afghanistan.

    Italy, France, and even Germany cooked their books to make the
    Masstricht and Germany suffers from 13% unemployment; the EC can not 
    afford their socialism and Kohl will need a new dinner table.

    Russia caves in after the mob bilked the international money market
    for over $500 billion!  the summit of the doomed: pairing a demented,
    addled drunk with a moral bankrupt went Saturday Night Live...

    and the only two economies which have been able to maintain their
    standard of living are watching...

    meanwhile, Rubin cooks the books, steals the Social Security
    Administration's kitty for unfunded IOUs.  the export of money
    grows and grows and grows --to China, whose state planned economy
    is as crony booked as Japan and China is preoccupied with learning
    to swim.

    Clinton thinks he can apologize for anything and Blair is playing
    cards in the back room. Ambrose came back to Washington to wait 
    for the kill. forget the report to Congress, give the backup
    material the fraudulent duo buried in 100 graves to hollyweird 
    --they wont need new plots for years.

    follow the money... dont worry about value; it's only relevant.

	attila out...    tickling the chesire cat.
