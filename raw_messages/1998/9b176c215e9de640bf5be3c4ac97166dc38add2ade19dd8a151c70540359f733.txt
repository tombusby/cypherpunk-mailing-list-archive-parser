[What company do you work for?  You disclaim about your "company" and
"clients" without mention of who they are?  (I like to know who the
GAKkers are, are you with securecomptuing.com also?)]

I understood it this way: that IETF policy is not allow political
considerations to weaken or otherwise damage security functions in
IETF standards.  eg. No weak key lengths for to satisfy local
government politics etc.

Read RFC 1984.  I quote:

: KEYS SHOULD NOT BE REVEALABLE
: 
:    The security of a modern cryptosystem rests entirely on the secrecy
:    of the keys.  Accordingly, it is a major principle of system design
:    that to the extent possible, secret keys should never leave their
:    user's secure environment.  Key escrow implies that keys must be
:    disclosed in some fashion, a flat-out contradiction of this
:    principle.  Any such disclosure weakens the total security of the
:    system.
: 
: DATA RECOVERY
: 
:    Sometimes escrow systems are touted as being good for the customer
:    because they allow data recovery in the case of lost keys. However,
:    it should be up to the customer to decide whether they would prefer
:    the more secure system in which lost keys mean lost data, or one in
:    which keys are escrowed to be recovered when necessary.  Similarly,
:    keys used only for conversations (as opposed to file storage) need
:    never be escrowed.  And a system in which the secret key is stored by
:    a government and not by the data owner is certainly not practical for
:    data recovery.

This quoted point is kind of relevant here:

 "keys used only for conversations (as opposed to file storage) need
  never be escrowed"

Now we move on to your GAK apologist arguments...

"Government" is composed of public servants.  This citizen-unit
doesn't want to fund spooks to spy on himself.

Oh give us a break!  You already admitted that terrorists are going to
use whatever crypto they want whether or not governments succeed in
ramming GAK down our throats.

Perhaps you would think that video cams in all the rooms in your house
(with feeds back to NSA) would be a good idea also,...  well you
install them, at your cost, and leave us out of your eavesdropping
plans, ta very much.
