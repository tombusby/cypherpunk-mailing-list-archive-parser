Announcing Extensis Mask Pro 2.0 


Now, get more tools, more control, and NO "futzing" with 
Mask Pro 2.0 http://www.extensis.com/products/MaskPro/


 NEW! EdgeBlender technology removes background colors from mask edges.
 NEW! PrecisionEdge detection creates EDITABLE magic paths for precise edging.
 NEW! IntelliBrush removes background color from an individual layer.
 NEW! Global choke tightens your entire mask-instantly. 
 IMPROVED! Smarter color-matching technology gives one-click masking.


Extensis MaskPro 2.0 is a significant upgrade to the industry standard
in masking software.  Mask Pro 2.0 features an expanded and enhanced 
set of sophisticated tools that let you take on any masking challenge 
and deliver professional, print-ready results. Mask Pro 2.0 gives you 
the power tools to create precision masks which far exceed the standard 
tools available in Photoshop 5.  With Extensis Mask Pro 2.0, spend 
your time creating, not "futzing".

With NEW EdgeBlender technology, instantly remove background colors 
from your mask edges, providing superior edges with NO halos. Then, 
use IntelliBrush and IntelliWand to remove background colors from a 
single layer-in a single click.  Experiment freely without 
concern-Mask Pro 2.0 has incremental and entire brush-stroke undos. 
Better yet, for complex edges, use PrecisionEdge to automatically 
create an editable magic path-adjust the tolerance, choke, threshold 
or edit the path on a pixel-level for the most precise edges possible. 

Best yet, access all of Mask Pro's tools from the NEW Extensis 
menu-right in Photoshop-using the commands you already know.

More Tools. More Control.  No "Futzing".  Mask Pro 2.0.
