True, but the amount of land needed to replace the oil reserves is a tad
excessive...

Why? It's in their best interest to use the product in their own country.

Indy racers  add various things to make it burn (usualy a orange) but I
don't have any references at hand and don't remember. Sorry I can't answer
that one specificaly.

That'll work for gasoline because soap and gasoline are soluble. I doubt it
would work very well for alcohol but once I get this mess with the tree
straightened out I'll do a little backyard experiment.

What I had in mind was to pour some alcohol on the concrete drive way and
light it. Then use a waterbottle with a water/soap mix. Do you think that
would be a suitable simulation?

Yep, use the roof of every 10+ houses to power a single house...

Ok, so you have acres and acres of power turbines on towers around Chicago,
where does Chicago move to? What about the rest of the country? The issue
after all is what happens when a renewable *replacement* for oil based fuels
is found? This is a much more global issue than Chicago. Besides putting a
wind generator on a building wouldn't even power the building.

Actualy it's not, if anything the pollution of mining, production, byproducts
of use such as acid rain, and some I've probably left out are only an
extension of the problem. The ignorance of long term costs of disposal and
ecological impact is one of my personal pet peeves with traditional economic
theory and why I pretty much think it's a pile of shit and economist in
general are idiots.

Ok, so we let PART of the people starve and die in the dark.

We don't have engines at this point that can do that. The fact is that it
takes more energy to get to the sun than it does to leave the solar system.
Nope, not the answer. (I do experimental, ie big bird, rockets for grins and
giggles)

Microwaves, and god help you if you happen to fly through one. I won't even
talk about the costs of development, control, maintenance, etc. This won't
fly any time in the next couple of hundred years at least. What about the
heating of the water in the air, can you say global warming on a scale that
would make the current issues irrelevant.

Absolutely, I want to replace it. I want to replace it with something that
is renewable, won't have the ecological impact of the others, won't squeeze
the small countries out, etc. If it requires killing a single salamander
then it's the wrong choice simply to make a profit.

I love trees.

The problem is that there aren't that many renewable resources that won't
break the bank or create a have/have-not situation that would be rife with
conflict potential.

You need pressure as well. But yes, this is a possibility as well. I
haven't seen the energy costs on this approach. The largest producers of
methane on the planet are cows. Perhaps we should shove a hose up the hinney
of all the cows...:)

Absolutely, there is a hurdle to jump. One of the main issues with the
traditional natural gas deposits are that they are expensive because of the
drilling requirements, non-renewable, and not evenly distributed to
potential users. Something deep-ocean clathrates and potentialy your
industrial process idea don't have.
