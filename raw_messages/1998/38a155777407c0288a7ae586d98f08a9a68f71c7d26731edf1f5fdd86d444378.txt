Isn't signing the document at least in theory a participatory creative act?
If you don't sign it then it doesn't exist in the same context as if you do.
Otherwise why have the signature? If I use a camera to sign a digital image
am I not stating that I have viewed and consented to the image being a valid
representation of what the lens saw? Seem quite similar to me.

A mechanism to sign a digital image would provide some base protection
against altering the image surreptitously, just as why you sign (and get a
copy) of other documentary evidence.
