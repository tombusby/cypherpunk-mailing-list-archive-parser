While I hope we are able to settle the civil aspects of this unfortunate release of false and
defaming information on me, I must anticipate, however, that I will have to seek judicial
review.

Therefore, under 5 USC 552, the Freedom of Information Act, and 5 USC 552a, the Privacy Act, I request 
access to copies

1  All documents describing YOUR efforts to properly investigate and settle this unlawful release of false and 
defaming information about me.

2  All WRITTEN documents, including phone call message notes or another notes, containing the name of 
William Payne, Bill Payne, etc. made between 3/18/98 and 6/30/98 by your or your staff.

If all or any part of this request is denied, please cite the specific exemption(s) which you think justifies your 
refusal to release the information and inform me of your agency's administrative appeal procedures available to 
me under the law.

I would appreciate your handling this request as quickly as possible, and I look forward to hearing from you 
within 20 working days, as the law stipulates.

This letter resembles one I sent to Ms. Varygas of your office on 6/29.  I append the Varyas letter to
this letter for your information.

Mr. Schlageter,  I hope this unfortunate matter can be resolved at the administrative
level at EEOC.  And I ask your help.

Sincerely,

  The Office of Inspector General (OIG) is empowered to investigate matters of fraud, waste
  and abuse which may be attendant to EEOC programs and operations.  We do not have
  programmatic responsibilities and are not involved in the administration and resolution
  of Privacy Act violations.

  Based upon our review of the information provided, we have determined that this matter,
  although important, is outside of OIG's purview and therefore does not warrant any  investigative action by   
  this office.  In regards to this issue contact:

	Ms. Ellen J. Varygas, Legal Counsel
  	Office of Legal Counsel
	1801 L. Street, Northwest, Room 6002

  Mr. Payne, I hope this information is helpful to you but regret that I can not provide the   remedy you seek.

June 16, 1998 A Jacy Thurmond, Jr, Assistant Legal Counsel/FOIA sent me some information
I requested on possible administrative remedy of the matter under a  FOIA/PA request.  My request was

While I hope we are able to settle the civil aspects of this unfortunate release of false and
defaming information on me, I must anticipate, however, that I will have to seek judicial
review.

within 20 working days, as the law stipulates.
