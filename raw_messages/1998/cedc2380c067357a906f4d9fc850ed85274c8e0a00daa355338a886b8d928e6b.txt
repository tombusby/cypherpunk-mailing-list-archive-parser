[Author's Note: This chapter, or continuation of the prologue,
 or whatever the fuck it is, contains an expose of the true
 diabolical nature of Lucky Green.
 Unfortunately, the only existing file-copy and printout are
 at the residence of a friend who is not currently at home,
 and it seems to be in my best interest to leave town in a
 hurry, without turning on my headlights and using only
 back roads and alleys.
 Anyone who is just so desperate to read Prologue 2/0 that
 they are peeing thier pants might want to email Jay Tolkoff
 at whatever internet address appears on Prologue 1/0 that
 was recently spammed to the CypherPunks list, pleading, 
 bribing, threatening or thanking him, in order to see if
 he might possibly be open to sending you (or the list) a
 copy of foresaid missive.
 At present, continuation of "Space Aliens Hide My Drugs"
 seems to be largely dependent upon the speed of my vehicle
 and the volume of my ammo supply. (The more things change,
 the more they remain insane.)
 And the good news is...
 As soon as I hit 'send', Baby and I will be hitting the
 road, under cover of darkness, with the sounds of Linda
 Lou and the Drifters belting out Leadbelly's "When I Was
 A Cowboy" in our wake.
 Don't get any on'ya...]
