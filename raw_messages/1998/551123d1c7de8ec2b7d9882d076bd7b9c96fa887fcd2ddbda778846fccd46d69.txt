A subsequent news report said hackers were taking discarded
(single-use?) MetroCards and "reprogramming" them so they
would work again.

However, the description didn't sound like it was really hacking...

The MTA said only 6 fraudulent uses of this was happening per day,
and 40 of these total per day.

"Of these"?

The MTA said there was some limited tolerance for nicked or
scratched cards, and in this situation - where the software
guessed that it was a scratched card - that it was programmed
to be "lenient" and let them in.

The news report showed the MTA's new recommendation for carrying
MetroCards: sliding them into a protective container for travel.

The mag-strip cards suck.
