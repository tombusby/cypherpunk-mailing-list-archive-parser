Bill,

Thanks for your response.  Such a simple idea, I kinda figgered (was 
hoping) that it was already thought of, but I hadn't heard of it.  I 
have been meaning to buy Schneier's book...

One of my points, however, is that if the division of the encrypted 
information is done properly, even if the private key were deduced by 
whatever means, all they would find is (for instance) the high order 
bits and some ECC, but nothing that could be used to regenerate any 
meaningful information without the other parts.  Because of this, I have 
been asking myself, how could any one datahaven operator be held 
responsible for holding classified, porn, or other information if they 
only have a meaningless slice of it?

Perhaps this is more a legal question (even more out of my league) than 
anything...  Any comments?
