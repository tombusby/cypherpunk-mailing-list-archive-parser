Understood.

That aspect is trivial from the mod-the-BIOS perspective, let's assume for a
moment that the crypto is in the ROM-burner...

Specificaly I am asking:

Given a BIOS which has been modified to allow the end-user to select between
encrypted and non-encrypted operation, how is the end-user supposed to
make this selection?

So far I've seen two suggestions:

1.	The BIOS is only 'sensitive' at particular points in the POST.

2.	The BIOS has a user-accessible selection via some method to
	activate their selection.

Both are workable, I'm looking for a more specific description of the
methods.

In the case of 1., is the marker going to be particular windows which are
bounded by particular messages printed to the boot console? In the case of
2. is it going to be a particular 'magic keystroke' that enables some hidden
option screen?

It seems to me that both have obvious methods of attack if the only goal is
to demonstrate to a legal standard that such capability exists.
