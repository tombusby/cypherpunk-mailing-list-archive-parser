Hacking 101
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)

        The end of senior year for most high school students is a time
   for college decisions, vacation planning and beer-tinged teenage
   revelry. Not so for Justin Boucher.

        Today the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-area native will be expelled from
   Greenfield High School because of an article he wrote entitled "So You
   Want To Be A Hacker." Published under a pseudonym in an unofficial
   student newspaper, it described in colorful (and sometimes profane)
   language how enterprising snoops could break into the high school's
   computer network.

        The advice ranged from the glaringly obvious ("Some commonly used
   passwords at very stupid schools are...") to the Hacker Code of Ethics
   ("Never harm, alter or damage any computers"). The finer points of
   hacker morality and teenage toomfoolery, however, were lost on irate
   school officials, who expelled Boucher for one year.
