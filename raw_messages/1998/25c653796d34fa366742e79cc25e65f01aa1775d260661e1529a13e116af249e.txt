I was amused to receive two mail messages back-to-back,
one from Peter Gutmann talking about New Zealand having one of the
strictest formal export controls in the world, and one from
RPK New Zealand talking about how their encryption product is
not export-controlled because it's from NZ, not the US,
and how their RPK Fast Public Key Encryptonite(tm) Engine
is the strongest crypto in the world.  Either they haven't
bothered asking for export permission, or they asked in such a way
that the export bureaucrats didn't notice it was crypto and
regulated by their crypto export preventers, or their crypto
somehow falls through the cracks, e.g. by using an algorithm with
public keys shorter than 512 bits (works for ECC, not RSA)
and private keys shorter than 40 bits (or 41 on a good day),
or perhaps passes the "snake oil test" for export permission.
I suppose it's possible that the NZ Export Bureaucrats have
lightened up since Peter's last dealings with them,
but it's not likely.

========= From Peter Gutmann's web page
This policy has resulted in New 
Zealand enjoying the dubious distinction of having the strictest export 
controls on earth, with everything ranging from crypto hardware down to 
software, library books, computer magazines, and journals being restricted 
from export.  It's not even possible for a university to publish academic 
research without prior permission from a government agency, and the 
requirements for obtaining this permission are structured to ensure that they 
can never be fulfilled.  You can find the information on:
