	Part 2 "Journalistic Secrecy is a Serious Problem" [2/4]

				[2/4]
Taken to the cleaners

["]Un["]fortunately, some of this is not as encouraging as it sounds. For a 
start, the ["]dirty["] money leaving banks may end up polluting other 
businesses [MONEY LAUNDERING IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS]. PoLice in Texas
say that foreign-exchange bureaux there have been a primary conduit for
channelling drug money to and from Mexico. Insurers are also vulnerable. One
recent laundering wheeze involves buying single-premium insurance policies
with ["]dirty["] money. These are then cashed in early in return for a 
"clean" cheque from the insurer, or used as collateral for a bank loan.
[On the way: Currency Transaction Reports for purchase of insurance policies
with cash and Early Redemption Reports for policies held less than 50 years.
Insurance agents will be required to report "suspicious" policy holders and
report possible "structuring" violations. Then they'll wonder why customers
are "shunning" insurance companies.] Even the rising cost of laundering may
not be unalloyed good news. It may simply reflect the emergence of a new 
group of professional launderers who are better at beating the system, and
charge more for doing so. [Or as Comrade Clinton would put it, "getting 
their fair share"] Some poLiceman fear that these experts may soon be using
electronic-cash systems to speed up the wash cycle (see box on next page).
[See post 4/4]

Worse [Better], as old laundering centres close their doors, new ones are 
opening theirs. The table above [shown below this paragraph] shows the 
countries that the State Department thinks face a severe money-laundering 
problem. (Even states with tough anti-laundering rules, such as America and 
Britain, are listed if their vigilance is considered essential in the
global fight against laundering.) The striking thing about the ranking is 
that it includes islands such as Cyprus, a ["]hive["] of offshore activity
for the Russian mafia, and Aruba, a Dutch dependency in the Caribbean, which
were not associated with laundering a few years ago. [Translation: Aruba
et. al. have always been on their shit list, and now that they've taken out 
the higher-priority targets e.g. CH and Cayman, the NWO _Microchip Extremists_
are setting their sights on shutting down the lower-yield peripheral sites.
(which they've "only just recently discovered" are pro-privacy areas)]
Another notable inclusion is Mexico, which the report describes as "the
money-laundering haven of choice for initial placement of US currency in the
world's financial system". In March, the [criminal] Mexican government 
unveiled a series of anti-laundering [fig leaf] measures in a belated effort
to clean up its reputation.

A Banks required (or permitted) to report suspicious transactions.
[Communese translation: entry-level bank tellers required (or permitted) to
make subjective determinations as to customers' intent and/or state of mind.
Required (or permitted) to report people encountered on city streets who
may be shunning banks in favor of foreign-exchange houses and cheque-cashing
outlets. Development of mind-reading skills mandated by executive order.]

B Government permits sharing of seized assets with other governments that 
assisted the underlying investigation.
[Communese translation: Thieves drawing paycheques from extorted proceeds 
allowed to share stolen goods with accomplices in other jurisdictions.
The Legislator/B-Crat/Snitch/Judge motto: "We Know Em When We Seize Um"]

C Non-banks must meet same anti-laundering provisions as banks.
[Communese translation: The woman with an appearance approximating the 
Wicked Witch of the West sitting behind the .357 Magnum resistant 
plastic that slips you 10,000,000 Bongonian bellylints in exchange for 10 
euros is also a deputized collectivist agent/informant.]

D Financial institutions and employees who provide otherwise confidential
data to investigators pursuing authorized investigations are protected from
prosecution.
[Communese translation:
Deputized Government Agents/Informants (that is, anyone with whom you 
exchange legal tender bank notes, a.k.a. "dirty" money) who provide 
"otherwise confidential" data so that "authorized investigators" may empty
your bank account are not accomplices to looters with sovereign immunity.]

[Notice again that the less fiscally totalitarian states are those actively
engaged in recalling their worthless currencies, forbidding (in theory) 
their domestic hostages from sending capital abroad, forbidding (in theory) 
holding gold or using other means of protection from criminal governments, 
defaulting on foreign loans and various shenanigans in a similar vein. From
this it can be concluded that for those on the outside looking in, chronic 
economic mismanagement and chaos are not necessarily a negative, these areas 
provide excellent entry points in the "rewire-chain"...]

In the future, more Asian countries could be added to the list. Rick 
McDonell [, looter ], the FATF's representative [of Satan] in Asia, warns 
that the region is ["]vulnerable["] to laundering because many of its 
economies are heavily cash-based. [Solution: go hire Jerry Seinfeld, Patrick 
Stewart and all the other convenience-card whores to shill for the cashless
society in Bangkok, Guangzhou and Kuala Lumpur?] Moreover, some countries 
such as India and Pakistan have large "underground" banking systems which 
sit alongside official ones [hawala]. Usually based on family or regional 
networks, these shift large amounts of money [and other stored units of 
value, e.g. crates of Avtomat Kalashnikova, "illegal" cash crops, RPGs, 
precious stones] around anonymously and cheaply. [25-28% markup indeed! 
Forget that rubbish] Such attractions, plus a lack of anti-laundering 
legislation, have already turned Thailand into a launderers' paradise. A 
report published last year [yet another report, this journalist needs to get
out into the real world, hanging with fiscal bureaucrats and professors is 
stunting Anon-E-Communists' growth] by Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University 
put the amount of money washing through the country each year at 730 billion
baht ($28.5 billion). This is equivalent to 15% of Thai GDP.

[In future watch for the following commercials to be run in these
vulnerable-to-laundering cash-based-economy television markets:

	Amarakan Sexpress - don weave shantytown witoutit
	VIZA - accep at FinSEN office wowide
	MassaCard - it's swave money]
