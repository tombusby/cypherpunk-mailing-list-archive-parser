>All of a sudden, my programming files were being corrupted in odd

>from other machines. No problem there. Viewed the file from a web based
>change browser in Internet Explorer. Same corruption in the file.
>Telnet'd to the server machine and just cat'd the file to the terminal.
>Same problem.
>
>What's going on?
>
>The lines that were corrupted were of the form
>#define one 1 /* foo menu */
>#define two 2 /* bar baz */
>
>What I always saw ON THIS MACHINE ONLY was:
>#define one 1 /* foo     */
>#  fine two 2 /* bar baz */
>
>Can you guess what was happening?
>
>Turns out, someone had inadvertly installed this piece of garbage
>called CyberSitter, which purports to protect you from nasty internet
>content. Turns out that it does this by patching the TCP drivers and
>watching the data flow over EVERY TCP STREAM. Can you spot the offense
>word in my example? It's "NUDE". Seems that cybersitter doesn't care if
>there are other characters in between. So it blanks out "nu */ #de"
>without blanking out the punctuation and line breaks. Very strange and
>stupid.
>
>It also didn't like the method name "RefreshItems" in another file,
>since there is obviously a swear word embedded in there. Sheesh.
>
>It's so bad it's almost funny. Hope this brightens your day as much as
>it brighted mine :-).
