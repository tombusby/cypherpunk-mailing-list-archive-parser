FCC PROPOSES LOCATION TRACKING FOR WIRELESS PHONES
http://www.cdt.org/action/filing.html

As the FBI has realized, new communications technology can be designed in
ways that vastly increase the potential for government surveillance.
Cellular and other wireless phones can generate information that can be
used to locate individuals even if they aren't suspected of a crime.

The FCC, with urging from the FBI, is considering a proposal to use your
cellphone as a personal tracking device. This unprecedented attack on your
privacy must be opposed.

Cellular phones have become integral to many peoples' lives. Over fifty
million ordinary Americans carry cellular phones with them as they go about
their daily activities. Cellular phones are far more closely linked to an
individual than are wireline phones. In essense, a cellular phone can
become a tracking device, revealing to the government far more about your
whereabouts, your associations, and your activities than the government can
learn about you from the fact that your home phone was used to make a call
a particular time of day.

In 1994, when this topic was being debated in Congress, FBI Director Freeh
testified that location information was not mandated by law. FBI Director
Freeh testified that the law, "does not include any information which might
disclose the general location of a mobile facility or service."

Congress wanted to protect privacy, and took the FBI at its word that it
would not seek to use cellphones as citizen tracking devices.

Now the FCC, with urging from the FBI, is proposing to rewrite the law,
requiring location information as part of a nationwide surveillance
capability. This will allow the FBI to use your cellphone as a personal
tracking device.
