Dear RealPlayer User,

I'm excited to tell you about a great software
product that will dramatically speed up your
dial-up connection for faster Internet access and
the availability of the RealPlayer and RealPlayer
Plus G2 'pre-beta' preview releases. 

TWEAKDUN ACCELERATES YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION

By optimizing your Windows 95 Registry internet 
settings, TweakDUN by Patterson Design Systems
eliminates fragmentation of data packets allowing
for faster Internet data transfer rates.

This means faster browsing, quicker downloads, and
improved Internet performance.

TweakDUN won ZDNet Editors' Pick with a 5-star rating!

   "TweakDUN is the most-cost efficient option 
    available for boosting your 'net speed."
         -- Stroud's Consummate Winsock
