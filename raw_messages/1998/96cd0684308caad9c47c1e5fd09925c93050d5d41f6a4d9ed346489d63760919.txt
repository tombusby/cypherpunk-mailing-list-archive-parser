Prospective Sellers are Asking for Information about Your Body and Soul

Let them know that you are local and are selling yourself into slavery 
by participating in the 1999 Guide to Slave Buying.  The Guide is an 
annual publication that is distributed to potential local and regional
buyers giving them useful buying information about slaves and servants
such as:

*  Data Entry Slaves  *  Humiliation Slaves  *  Forced Exhibitionism 
*  Slave Consulting  *  Y2K Slave Financing Plans  *  Sex Slaves
* Additional Uses For Your New Sex Slave  

I am contacting you, because you were listed in the search engines as wishing
to sell yourself into slavery to offer services tht fit the needs of the 
prospective buyers we contacted.

To get more information, go to:  http://www.sexslaves.com

or email:  alt.sex.wanted@news.demon.co.uk or alt.sex.bondage@news.demon.co.uk

**Note you will only receive this message once for each time you spam us. This is
a list, and you do not need to respond with "yes". It is automatically assumed that
you are interested in our offer.

If you are purchased, you will be abducted by a black van as you depart for
work one morning.
