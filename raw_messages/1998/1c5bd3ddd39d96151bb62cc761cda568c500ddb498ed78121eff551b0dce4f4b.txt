Serpent - A New Block Cipher Proposal for AES

Over the last six months, I have been working with Ross Anderson and 
Lars Knudsen to develop a candidate block cipher for the Advanced 
Encryption Standard. 
Our algorithm, called Serpent, is described in a paper that will appear 
at the 5th workshop on FastSoftware Encryption.A reference 
implementation by Frank Stajano, a research students of Ross, is 
available here. 

The authors' home pages can be found both in 
http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/, http://www.ii.uib.no/~larsr/, and
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/.
The authors' email addresses are biham@cs.technion.ac.il, 
larsr@ii.uib.no, and rja14@cl.cam.ac.uk.
