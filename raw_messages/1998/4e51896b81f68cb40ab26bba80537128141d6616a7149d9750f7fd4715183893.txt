ATTENTION:  This is an awareness notification from Personal Funds
Recovery, Inc.  http://www.fundsrecovery.com

We want to inform the North American public about money they are owed,
and then help them get it back.  

There is over 400 billion dollars in unclaimed money in the U.S.  

More than 50% of North Americans are owed a portion of this money.  

You should check to see if you are owed some of this money.

It is unclaimed money that people simply forgot about or never knew
existed.  Here are some examples: checking and savings accounts, 
stocks and bonds, IRA accounts, teacher retirement plans, union
pensions, dividends, payroll checks, insurance policies, security
deposits, safety deposit boxes, pension funds, the Social Security
Administration, United States Treasury, Internal Revenue Service,
and many, many more.

Visit our web site at http://www.fundsrecovery.com and we will conduct
a search for you.  We can also perform a search for companies!
