Actualy identical twins will only share about 50% of their DNA. They get 50%
from each parent randomly. This means that only about 25% of the DNA will
match their sibling from either parent.

This of course ignores transcription errors, environment issues, etc. It is
possible that even a clone would have protein discrepencies which trace back
to DNA strands that end up different than the original source organism. As
the organism develops and ages these issues can become quite important. This
aspect of DNA matching has gotten the short shift for sure.
