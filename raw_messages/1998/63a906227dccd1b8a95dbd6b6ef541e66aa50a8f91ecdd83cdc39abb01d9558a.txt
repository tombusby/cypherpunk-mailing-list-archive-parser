I read  Nuclear BIOS

                             Sandia Scraps Guided Nuke Project

                               We were just having fun, Hagengruber says

      Sandia National Laboratories has shut down an effort to design a
guided nuclear bomb that critics       say was aimed at Third World
targets. 
     
     Sandia pulled the plug because of controversy over the fact that
the lab never received permission       for the project from senior
levels of the Clinton administration, said Sandia vice president
Roger       Hagengruber. 

     A flight test scheduled for next month in which an unarmed
prototype was to have been dropped from       an airplane has been
canceled, Hagengruber said, and lab scientists will wrap up their
reports on        their four-year work on the project by the end of
September. 

     Critics said the $15.5 million project was intended to give U.S.
military forces a new kind of           nuclear bomb that could be used
in conflicts against small nations trying to acquire nuclear,           
biological or chemical weapons. ...

At the height of implementing the seismic data authenticator 
http://jya.com/da/whpda.htm based on NSA's
deficient algorithm.  See Appendix S http://jya.com/da/whpda.htm#apps I
SQUANDERED about $50k
EACH WEEK on a flawed concept based and a deficient algorithm.

My ROUGH guess that I WROTE OVER $250,000 in purchase orders for the
Sandia seismic data authenticator! 

This amount DID NOT INCLUDE MY SALARY, a TECHNICIAN, and Travel.

  The first implementation was done in 1974, by R. E. D. Stewart, D. A.
Reynolds, and J. G. Deasey. This   was a "bench test" implementation in
the sense that the algorithm was done in hardware wire, wrapped on  
"cash" cards, and placed in a test rack. http://jya.com/da/whpda.htm

Reynolds and Deasy did the work.  Stewart was one of Hagenguber's spook
shop [building 868] employees.  

Stewart merely wrote the report.  

Stewart wrote that the cost of the prototype was $400,000 if my memory
is correct.  The money came from
outside Sandia, perhaps NSA or DARPA.

I was ordered by project leader H B Durham to hold the cost down.

I was also ordered by Durham follow NSA's orders.

Durhams exact words were

   If they want a pink overcoat, sell them a pink overcoat.

I KNEW while I was doing the work that both the data authentication
concept was flawed - multiple
redundant stations is the correct AND CURRENTLY IN USE concept - and the
algorithm was BAD.

So did Durham from what he told me.  

Durham regarded the data authenticator as a necessary political evil,
was my opinion.

Durham's boss was John Holovka.  Holovka's boss was Paul Stokes.

Stokes told me that the concept of data authentication was invented at
Sandia and that he, Stokes, invented it.

Stokes ordered the data authenticator fielded over the classification
objections of NSA.

Stokes boss was ROGER HAGENGRUBER.

I've been involved with shift register implementation work for a LONG
TIME.

  It has been over about 27 years since I directed any Ph.D. students

  http://www.friction-free-economy.com/
  http://www.mhpcc.edu/general/john.html

So I documented the bad NSA algorithm and implementation advice. 
http://jya.com/da/whpda.htm

My SAND report cost A LOT OF MONEY to produce for the REPORT ALONE.

But NOT ALL OF THE MONEY WAS WASTED.

The seismic data authenticator is ANOTHER OF   ROGER HAGENGRUBER'S   
PROJECTS

Roger Hagengruber is making news

http://www.abqjournal.com/scitech/1sci8-14.htm

Hagengruber

1  was Jim Durham's office mate when Hagengruber was new at Sandia.
   
   H. B. Durham who served as project leader  
   http://jya.com/da/whpda.htm

2  was C William Childers' boss

3  was James Gosler's boss

4  was Paul Stokes' boss

  Originator: Paul A. Stokes Date: 4/28/92 http://jya.com/da/whpda.htm

5  encouraged Sandia to do more 'work for others' projects like for 
   the FBI and NSA.

   This includes the 'spiking work' for NSA.

   http://caq.com/cryptogate
  
6  told employees that Hagengruber favored shifting Sandia labs from
   DOE control to DOD control.

7  was one of the main people involved in getting me fired and 
   CAUSING THIS MESS.

This matter CLEARLY should be settled before it GETS WORSE!
