Found this in sci.crypt. I'm suprised it didn't hit the lists yet.

> WASHINGTON, DC -- A top U.S. official acknowledged more than a

> Clinton Administration is "more costly and less efficient" than

> In a November 1996 memorandum to other government officials,
> William A. Reinsch, the Commerce Department's Under Secretary for
> Export Administration, discussed the Administration's efforts to
> promote "escrowed" or "recoverable" encryption techniques in

> unscramble encrypted information and they form the cornerstone of
> current U.S. encryption policy.

> After noting that government regulations permit the export of non-
> escrowed encryption products only to "safe end-users" such as
> foreign police and security agencies, Reinsch recognized the
> inferiority of the Administration's favored technology:

>      Police forces are reluctant to use "escrowed" encryption
>      products (such as radios in patrol cars). They are more
>      costly and less efficient than non-escrowed products.
>      There can be long gaps in reception due to the escrow
>      features -- sometimes as long as a ten second pause. Our
>      own police do not use recoverable encryption products;
>      they buy the same non-escrowable products used by their
>      counterparts in Europe and Japan.
> 
> Ironically, Reinsch's concession is contained in a memorandum that
> discusses the Administration's strategy to "help the market
> transition from non-recoverable products to recoverable products."
> According to EPIC Legal Counsel David Sobel, the newly released
> document "suggests that the Clinton Administration is trying to

> position of the American computer industry and hold back the
> development of the privacy protections so badly needed on the
> Internet."
