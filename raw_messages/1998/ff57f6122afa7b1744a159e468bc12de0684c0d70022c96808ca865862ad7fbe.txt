What sort of use do you see it being put to? One or two stations wouldn't be
worth the investment in money or time. Would it be some sort of private
channel or the backbone of a more complex enterprise? Do you see it being a
form of employment in the crash in that the operator could trade
communications access for vittles and ammo?

As to protocols, the standard IP packet software seems to work just fine (I
think it's something like KA9Q or some such). I've used it twice and it
worked like a champ.

Are you proposing to get a license or would it be strictly underground until
after the crash?
