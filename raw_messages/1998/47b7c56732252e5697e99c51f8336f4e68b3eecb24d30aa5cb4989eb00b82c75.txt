Hi, 

It took a few minutes to find one, but below is just one of the many
standards that are implimented for plastic uses in the home that make
reference to minimal levels of HCN in particular.

Despite what some folks would like you to believe, plastics in conflagration
are *NOT* safe to inhale even in small quantitites because of these gases.

Note that I edited a bunch of lines out for brevity.
