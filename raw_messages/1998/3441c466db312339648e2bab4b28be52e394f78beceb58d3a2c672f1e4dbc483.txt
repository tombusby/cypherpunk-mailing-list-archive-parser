On the news tonight, channel 3 and 31 both featured stories about
Sacramento sheriff deputy supervisors getting "semi-automatic AR-15"
rifles.  It was hilarious.  Channel 3 showed a close-up of the receiver,
which was clearly marked with "M16A1".  I got this funny feeling that them
thar AR-15's will rock 'n roll if the deputy supervisor finds himself in a
North Hollywood style situation...can you say Disinformation, boys and
girls?
