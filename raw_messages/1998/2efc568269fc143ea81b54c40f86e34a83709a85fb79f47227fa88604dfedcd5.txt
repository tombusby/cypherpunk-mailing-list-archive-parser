I see this as well and agree with it.  The recent stock market rocking back and
forth is a sign that something sucks, and sucks badly.  Y2K will of course make
this into a bigger horror.

I don't necessarily see this.  What do you base this on?  Outside of where I
live, there is an elementary school.  Young kids these days are made to wear
UNIFORMS and carry ID's and can only go to school with see through bags and
must pass through metal detectors and/or be frisked.

Further, one of the local newspapers (Times? Daily News? Post?) here in NYC had
some story about how the city school security will be taken over by the police
department, effectively turning schools into jails.  IMHO, this won't turn out
delinquents, this will turn out slaves who are used to being treated as slaves,
are used to having no freedoms and don't expect them; they'll live without
privacy and they'll like it.  Those are your kids America: sheep!

Mindless slaves rarely rebel; unless you take away their MTV and their Sony
Playstations I doubt this.

Doubt it.  Unless they can't get food or money, or IF there are massive
blackouts they will riot, but will do so to break into stores and loot.
(Speaking based on LA riots and riots here in NYC about a decade or two ago
when power failed.)

Okay, this is likely.

The rest of your prediction sounds like you've watched Robocop a few times too
many and actually BELIEVED it! :)  Care to back it up with reasons?
