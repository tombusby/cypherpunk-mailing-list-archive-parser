I made the mistake of replying back to austin-cpunks instead of this
list.  If anyone attending CFP this week in Austin would like to get
together let me know.  Or just show up on Saturday for the local meet.

Thanks,
Troy

You should send a notice to 'cypherpunks@ssz.com' so that your offer can be
propogated to the entire crew quickly.
