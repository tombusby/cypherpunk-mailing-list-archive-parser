"Polis" is an arcane Scandanavian (sic) word for "Police".

That's as creative as Ukranian-Romainian-Gypsie Vulis can do.

Vulis couldn't even hack it in Manhatten, and had to leave.

His brother, Michael, said the family disowns Dimitry as the asshole
of the family line.

----

Regarding emailing Vulis to show him some appreciation: as you can see
from the headers, he is so disliked that he needs to connect to the
Net using UUCP!

   HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA

And so, he has to download his mail before filtering/reading it, and
domain 'dm.com' is MX wild-carded to accept all references.

So, wouldn't it be funny if people started signed _him_ up for
Eureka, Russian Jewish Singles dating, etc?

Also, simply sending him largish missives will tie up his
poor UUCP link. So, if it doesn't violate your local TOS,
I think all of us should let Dr. Dim hear about it until
he cleans up his act.
