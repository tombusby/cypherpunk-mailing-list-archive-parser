hi timmy. we have reached a breakthrough in your psychotherapy
in which you actually address me directly <g>

you completely gloss over my point about Linux, because
it demonstrates my arguments very well. those who work
on Linux are very similar to cpunks. distributed all
over the world, and they are united by a common desire/vision
and mailing lists.  you have an unexpressed 
hatred of some aspects of
hacking, of course, so you find linux repulsive and
incomprehensible.

this list has always lacked vision, by *anyone*. a group
is united by a vision. if you have no vision, you have
nothing but a bunch of anarchists who cannot accomplish
anything substantial together. want proof? how about the
history of the last few years of mounting irrelevance of
this list?

what you get is miniature
projects that may succeed or fail, and if they succeed,
an implication is carried that they are "cpunk" projects.
there are obviously no cpunk projects. and that's the
weakness of this so-called "group". any time such a project is proposed
by anyone, self-righteous anarchists such as yourself
shoot it down.

ok, mount one of your lame arguments that "this is only
a mailing list. there are no projects". again, precisely.
you want more out of this list, or less? every time I 
tell you how to get more, you say you want less. every
time you complain you get less, I tell you how to get more.

sure, let's have an immature debate society. we've had
that for what, ~6 years or so? the time flies when you're
having fun <g>

aren't you somewhat ashamed that the recent EFF crack
had *nothing* to do with anyone on this list? frankly, I think
it's pretty lame. imagine the way a 
mailing list can help mobilize support and
resources. we've seen glimpes in the past of this.
instead Gilmore did it entirely behind the
scenes, never announcing it to this list, because 
clearly no one here has the maturity to cooperate to complete
a meaningful project. there are only complaints, as lead
by the Lead Sniper. (wow, that's a funny term, with lots
of implications, I think I might start using it more often!!!)
btw, killed any cats lately??

a huge waste of talent, if you ask me, and the main reason
that you have such a high turnover/attrition on this list.
ever asked yourself why there is so much turnover/attrition
here? but we're not going to get very far, with you conveniently
deleting my key points as usual. stick your head in the
digital /dev/null some more. see no VZN, hear no VZN, 
speak no VZN. truly your philosophy...!!!

"eletrocracy"? I have no idea what you're talking about.
whatever it is, it does sound pretty infantile!!!
a useful straw man, I suppose.  maybe if you elaborated it 
might refresh my memory <g>
