Greetings!

I am looking for people who are serious about making money in network 
marketing.  I would like to request the chance to send you information 
on the company that I promote.
If you are completely happy where you are right now, then I simply wish 
you the best.Are you really making money? WHAT ABOUT YOUR DOWNLINE?  If 
you are in any way dissatisfied or disappointed with your experience in 
the network marketing industry, please email me back
so I can send you some information that could be the turning point in 
your networking efforts.
If you would like to learn more about a company that is leading this 
industry in the right direction, please send a reply email back 
with"More Info" in the subject line.


God Bless,
