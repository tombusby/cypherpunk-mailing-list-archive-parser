Thanks so much for responding.

I have VB 6.0 and masm 6.11.

Got masm 6.11 working okay.

But I get an error 48 in VB 6.0.

I am sleuthing-out what is going wrong.

By starting simple.

I looked at the NT samples!

I notice that the NT 32 bit code is different from the 16 bit
api.

I thought I might have grossed you out.

And therefore got no response.

I am SICK about what happened.

But the word is getting out.  http://www.aci.net/kalliste/bw1.htm

I got PAID to write the attached.

I will let you know WITH SOURCE CODE of my progress.

And thanks so much for helping.

I am SUPER-PLEASED with

Sam and Joyce were VERY NICE.  Sam declared me a Delphi user.  And, 
therefore,  I got VB 6.0 for me for $261.43. http://www.samintl.com

With its 800 mb of documentation.  Grollier's encylopedia fits on a
650 mb cd rom!

I got a separate sheet showing the billing to my credit card.  Which
I will pass on.

Let me show you the machines I did the work for.

One version used the Forth from my book.

I wrote the assembler dlls for the PC Data System version which
interfaces to VB 3.0.

My feeling is that you might get some CONSULTING business if you create
a FORUM on masm at your site.

John Young is a LEADER on internet FORUMS http://www.jya.com/index.htm. 

And J Orlin Grabbe  http://www.aci.net/kalliste/, who edited the
attached article, is a leader on FORUMS on economics and CLINTON. 
Grabbe was on 60 minutes.

BUT you have to create a 

           DYNAMIC 

SIMPLE SITE containg INFORMATION OF USE.

Hope to hear from you again.  And NOTHING EVIL.

Other than MASM, FORTH, LINK, ML, NMAKE, Microsoft ... Worse, of couse,
than
the Great Satan.
