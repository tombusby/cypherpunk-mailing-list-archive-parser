When you're at that level you don't carry the data across the line you 
get some Johnnie Mnemonic to do it for you or put it in a diplomatic pouch...

Consider that at any given time there are only a few hundred BIOS'es, made
from a few dozen base images, driving all the machines out there. The number
of companies that develop their own BIOS in toto for in-house products is next
to nil (I know of none). What they do is buy a license and then re-write the
sections they need to.

The TEMPEST signal will be effected by speed, I see no reason to suspect
that it's going to be processor dependant. Since the code gets executed
in the same sequence in these shared BIOS there is going to be a shared
footprint, which may get squeezed because of increased clock speed. Measuring
that footprint at ranges of inches is nowhere near as expensive as trying to
catch a monitor image from a block away.

If you store those few thousand footprints and do a compare any bozo can
in fact run the machine. Just sit and watch to see if the red light comes
on and call your supervisor.
