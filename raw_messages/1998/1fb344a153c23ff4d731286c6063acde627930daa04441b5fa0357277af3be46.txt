I agree with the reference to Sci-Am, with one priviso. A few years ago they
put a pair of books on just these topics. They are a collection of articles
published over the years and instead of digging through a variety of
magazines and such these two will save a lot of time.

Particles and Forces: The heart of the matter
ISBN 0-7167-2070-1
$11.95

Particle Physics in the Cosmos
ISBN 0-7167-1919-3
$9.95

And a much more technical book that I like a lot is:

Understanding Quantum Physics: A user's manual
M.A. Morrison
ISBN 0-13-747908-5
~$50

Enjoy.
