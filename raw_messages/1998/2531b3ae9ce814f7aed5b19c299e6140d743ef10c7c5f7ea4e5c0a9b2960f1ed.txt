Hi,

I'm aware of the Goldbach Reduction by Fermat. The problem is once this
theorem is placed in the geometric domain the fact that n-prime factors can
be reduced to 2 prime factors is critical and a hinderance. 

It simply isn't possible to tile a even aread triangle with two smaller
congruent triangles whose area is prime. As a result Goldbach's older form
is more applicable.

If it can be shown that such a tiling is always possible then by extension
of Fermat's conjecture the two prime supposition is proved.

Reductionism can be a friend or an enemy, swords cut both ways.
