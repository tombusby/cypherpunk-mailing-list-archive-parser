Wired recently had pix/columns on Rivest and Schneier.  This is 
how crypto will get into the popmind: through sophisticated deadtrees like
this read by propeller heads *and* suits.  The Cryptos talk of
the economy, of keeping crackers out, of personal privacy.  The
list of good uses will grow.  

The Fascistas will be stuck with only their dealers and the 
vaporrists, vapornappers, vaporophiles they will continue
to worship.

Eventually, the Sheeple will grok what's being argued over.
The rest depends on your optimism level.
