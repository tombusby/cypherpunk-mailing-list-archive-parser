INTRODUCTION
> 
>      First there were pocket calculators, then personal memory
> organizers (PMO's), and next fully operating computers the size of a
> personal check book. 
>        Now the latest device to join the personal electronic evolution
> is a palm sized unit that fits easily in a shirt or purse pocket and
> is unlike anything you've seen before. Called a GENDEX, it not only
> keeps track of people data and personal appointments, it can also
> track personal or business expenses and serve as a depository
> and dispensary for real time monetary transactions over the Internet.
> And for those with email, just have it forwarded directly to your
> GENDEX.
>         What strikes you first about the GENDEX is its size - just
> seven inches by 3.5" and 3/8" deep - small enough to be carried almost
> anywhere - like an "electronic wallet". The second thing that you
> notice is its unusual keyboard - again, unlike anything else you've
> ever seen or used.
>         At first, the keyboard seems strange and undecipherable -
> instead of the usual QWERTY layout in rows, the keys are arranged in a
> circle on the small, one-finger keyboard, with the most common letters 
> in the inner circle. It's strange until you begin to use it. As you
> catch on to the pattern, you begin to see the benefit of the
> one-handed, one-finger layout, and most people quickly attain fairly
> high data entry rates with very little practice.
>         But it's not only this unusual keyboard that make the GENDEX
> different - and useful. Its the fact that the GENDEX can store,
> receive, and transmit financial data and monetary units over any
> financial network, including secure radio and Internet transmissions.
> Imagine being anywhere, buying or selling anything, and being able to
> complete the transaction with you hand-held personal bank. (In the
> future, it will even include a bar code reader to scan in any item or
> price!)
>         The GENDEX has been designed with the computer illiterate in
> mind. The keypad is simple looking with a minimum of entry keys, and
> every action and transaction is prompted for the next step. Just
> "follow the bouncing ball" and it steps you through anything you want
> to do with a minimum of learning time.
>         It's also designed to be used in any weather, dropped, sat on,
> stepped on, etc. The unique patentable self locking case is
> waterproof, shock proof, breakproof and, most importantly, idiot
> proof...instead of reaching for your wallet, in the future, many
> thousands of people will be reaching for their GENDEX. Programmed in
> JAVA with user replaceable chip sets, the GENDEX is easily upgradable
> as new features and uses come out.
>         The universally-usable GENDEX Java software will hopefully be
> available by the year's end. Until then, you'll just have to stay with
> using old fashioned credit cards, hand written checks, and nearly
> obsolete cash and currency. To check out a live demonstration of the
> GENDEX and its functions, visit the GENDEX website at http://gendex.net.
> 
> 
> ORGANIZER LOGIC REACHES UNDENIABLY EASY TO USE STATE
>  
>     Gendex organizer logic is now the most idiotproof and clearly easy
> to understand organizer logic in the world. Thanks to the efforts of
> an entrepreneurial team, a logical prototype has been crafted in the
> Java programming language and is open for testing at
> http://gendex.net. This was finally accomplished after many years of
> logic design by some clearly ingenious persons.
>      This new logic works with the seventeen key input and
> classification system developed by DEXCOM over numerous iterations.
> There are 4 main memory keys, 7 system keys, 4 arrow keys that move
> the cursor or scroll the display, and YES & NO keys. Each of the main
> memory keys opens with a table containing all the main functions you
> can do in that division of the memory organizer. Each of the
> functions, when selected, opens into a list of variations. These are
> called TABLES, and there are four, AGENDA, PEOPLE, MONEY and NOTES. 
> 	Ease-of-use comes from consistent application of ENTRY, INDEX and
> FIND system keys. HELP is ready to pop-up at any time to give the user
> easy to understand directions and options.
> 	By keying SYSTEM, Utilities like e-mail in/out, secure-unviolatable
> memory storage upload, communications carrier select, edit
> scratchpads, output port control, e-bank selection, proper
> calculators, smart power monitors, thesaurus/dictionary, and language
> translation are accessible within any memory function.
> 	The demonstration on the website can be played with manually using
> the selecting device and keying functional buttons. Soon a new control
> panel will be added, so that the demonstration can be played
> automatically by pressing the purposefully direct logic sequence keys.
> The automatic links shall have a 
> player piano effect - eventually more than 111 functional logic
> strings  so that even the passive websurfer can instruct himself about
> many things this unit does. 
> 	The logical prototype works in newest browsers, and there is a
> download assist button on the website to bring the latest browser into
> your own computer.
> 	What is happening now in DEXCOM is a team of five time-investing
> engineers are working toward completing a logical prototype. That is
> leading to completion of a working software product.
> 	The next step for the company will be to license the Gendex logic
> system for use to the makers of the many hard-to-use and complicated
> handheld and PDA systems already in user's hands. The first company
> product is a software disk that adds the friendly usable gendex
> functions to products like the H-P 620 handheld.
> 
> 
> Interested Parties:
> 
> DEXCOM USA Inc. is introducing its ultimate electronic personal memory
> organizer (Gendex EPMO). Gendex keeps track of Agenda, Money, People
> and Notes, and more. Gendex is the perfect vehicle for financial
> networks sending money via secure data radio, and over the internet.
> Gendex software will be available for purchase. It has all the
> easy-to-use logical prompts, and on-line real-time help functions to
> assist in all
> forms of transactions and memory recording. No other product in the
> market has all the ease of use and understandability built into it
> that Gendex does. This is the breakthru. Nearly all the others are
> expert systems requiring extensive training to use all functions.
> Gendex hardware will be available before the year 2000. It is
> waterproof, breakproof, and pocket sized. Its multichip module design
> will be widely licensed for lowest cost to the consumer. The company
> will brand name its own highest quality unit, and grade and distribute
> components made by world class manufacturers working under our
> lisences. Our designs utilize the latest technologies that can be made
> accessible to mass markets. 
> On the website is a fully animated gendex shell opening; it also now
> working logical prototype.
> Price per privately issued share of DEXCOM USA Inc. stock just
> quadrupled to $4, and is approaching IPO, with the potential for an
> eight way stock split.
> 
> 
> GENDEX.NET TO REORGANIZE CIVILIZATION
> 
> NEVER BE LATE 
> The advanced timekeeping and AGENDA scheduling functions that make it
> possible to schedule and remember one-time events, recurring events,
> and even place events in someone else's schedule (if they don't
> prevent you from doing so). This will eliminate a lot of potential
> embarassment to those who may forget about where they said they would
> be.
> 
> TELEPHONES
> Thanks to internet telephony, and the presence of speaker & microphone
> on the unit, and headsets for the pocketsized gendex, both cellular
> phones and home phones, and their networks, will have a lot less to
> do. This is because internet telephony is practically free, even for
> long distance calls.
> 
> PAPER MONEY
> The hazards and time consuming processes of making change will be
> replaced with the ease of sending money optically to smart cash
> registers and vending machines, parking meters etc., with optical
> interfaces to money registrars with radio outputs. (Of course, 'users'
> are subject to national banking laws.)
> 
> ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER
> People will be able to receive and pay bills, and send each other
> money over secure data networks. Gendex has all necessary logic to
> set-up and actualize transactions.
> 
> CREDIT CARDS
> Credit organizations will become E-BANKs using Gendex hardware and
> software, because it cuts costs. Until then, Gendex hardware has the
> power to directly write money to mag stripe cards. Ultimately,
> Gendex.net will send a lot of plastic to the scrap heap.
> 
> RIDECALL
> Eliminates superfluous automobiles by providing people you like (based
> on lifestyle) with rides to where they need to go, as you make money.
> This is coordinated by Gendex.net. Meet new friends, too.
> 
> MONITORING THE HONESTY OF YOUR LOCAL BANK
> Those who maintaing their files in CONVENTIONAL BANK ACCOUNTS
> MANAGEMENT will be able to keep track of interest they should be
> paying you, ATM costs, other banking costs and penalties to monitor
> accuracy of your local bank.
> 
> TRADING AND SELLING OVER THE NET
> Every kind of service or material goods will eventually be listed in
> the Bought,Buy,Sell&Trade INDEX. Gendex logic will enable everybody to
> sell or trade their goods and services, through Indexers who are
> already specialists in their respective fields. These Indexers do not
> work for gendex.net, rather they remain independant, while gendex.net
> takes a very small commission each time electronic banks transfer money.
> 
> FORMATS
> Prompted data entry of frequently repeated questions, coupled with
> radio access to remote data bases will eliminate clipboards and paper
> forms used in all repetitive data entry used in professional purposes.
> Gendex.net will create a library of tens of thousands of different
> formats for use by government, industry, military, courts, medical,
> and professionals in every walk of life. And these can be sent by
> radio to the Thousands of typists working in data entry jobs will need
> to find something else to do.
> 
> TAX DEDUCTIONS
> Every taxpayer who can write off business expenses will never lose
> expense records, and find many advantages with Gendex' advanced
> recording capabilities.
> 
> PHARMACY.NET
> Gendex prompted data entry and secure verification will eliminate the
> problem of reading doctor's cryptic handwriting. From NOTES, doctors
> specify treatments. A pharmacist in a van will come driving up to your
> house to serve the prescription rendered by doctors.
> 
> MEDICAL HISTORY
> Whatever ails you, and when, and how, can be recorded so that after
> you're dead, and they do the autopsy, they will have something to go on.
> 
> TELEVISION INTERNET REMOTE CONTROL
> Gendex EPMO hardware, with its highpowered bidirectional infrared
> port, can replace the intelligent aspect of internet boxes designed to
> bring internet via cable to people's living room televisions. 
> 
> SMART LOCKS ACCESS
> In the future, metal door locks will be replaced with a glass plate
> guarding an optically activated solenoid. This will enable smart
> systems in buildings to record who passed thru a door, when, and/or to
> execute decisions about who is authorized to pass. It can even require
> remittance of money, or act as a time clock for workers. Gendex EPMO
> hardware, with its bidirectional infrared port can handle all these
> transactions.
> 
> TRUCKERS LOGBOOK
> Over the road drivers will be able to accurately maintain records of
> how much time they spent driving, and what happened at points of
> delivery. With GPS attachment, trucker will always know where he is.
> 
> PROFESSIONAL TIME LOG
> Consultants who charge in small increments for time spent advising
> clients will benefit readily by the functions provided in this logic.
> 
> SPEAKING TRANSLATOR
> An issued unit of Gendex hardware or software will typically handle as
> many languages in its interface as one chooses to download.
> Ultimately, Gendex is intended to be able to handle all of input of
> characters in the users language, translation to another language like
> English or Japanese, and speaking that language via its speaker to
> listening "barbarians". 
> 
> You may argue that all these things are happening anyway, and indeed,
> some of them are. The difference here is that gendexes can be given
> away free to customers by financial institutions, in exchange for
> placing cash on deposit.

> WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT
> 
> 	The automatic logical demonstration on the website displays more than
> 59 logical functions. Actually, the number which will be programed is
> about 385, well organized and all totally accessible. Our "nearest
> competitor" in hardware (really, predecessor) 3COM PALM PILOT has only
> 4 logical functions. 
> 	Not only that, our hardware product exceeds all others because it is
> pocketsized, waterproof, breakproof and most importantly, idiotproof.
> Gendex hardware is an email machine that goes with you everywhere,
> even underwater. It's application specific electronic design is user
> serviceable and infinitely upgradeable. 
> 	Gendex hardware is designed with a microphone and a speaker to make
> telephone calls free over the internet. There is also a headset that
> attaches to the lower bidirectional optical ports. 
> 	Logically speaking, it is far easier to use Gendex than those
> products which are not as well designed and thought out. Gendex
> software has prompted data entry and on-line help, being designed for
> the computer-illiterate, thus will replace QUICKEN and most any
> organizer programs. 
> 	Gendex Software, and later hardware, includes prompted logic to
> handle electronic money transactions for on-line banks, and the user
> can make transactions safely. The palm Gendex is being designed with
> completely integrated dataradio (like a pager) and complete TCPIP for
> transmissions of email and e-money over private networks, the
> internet, wherever he goes, with no fear of losing his money
> (depending on what security software is available and what e-bank he
> uses).

> 
> MAD VENTURE CAPITALIST WANTED
> 
> No sane venture capitalist would ever invest in DEXCOM. 
> Sane venture capitalists believe that the publication of this website,
> http://gendex.net, will awaken a giant sleeping gorilla. Its pretty
> obvious that the moment DEXCOM begins to succeed, some giant Japanese
> conglomerate or even Microsoft will create all sorts of knockoffs and
> circumvent all of DEXCOM's patent rights, earned in 14 years on R & D
> unsupported by all but the scantiest investments from people who
> should have known better than to waste their money on this, and loads
> of sweat equity. The very-innovative big established companies, with
> their risk taking daredevil unconventional creative engineers, would
> rather do it themselves, than license the technology, in order to get
> it all for themselves. Even Microsoft knows, it can walk all over
> little companies with complete impunity. The sane partners of any MAD
> venture capitalist who would even consider investing in this little
> startup, will wisely tell them that this is a considerable risk with
> little possible outcome in the way of capital gains. Its pretty
> obvious that there is no more to this website that meets the eye at a
> superficial glance. Not worth considering more because the sane
> venture capitalist sees that if its not a complete fake, that this
> must be just another remake, just another failure in the field of
> personal electronic organizers. It's a shame that so many
> unsophisticated people believe that DEXCOM could succeed. While its
> true that the little company continues to draw support from advance
> orders for its units, coming from little, uneducated and
> unsophisticated future customers, every savvy high class venture
> capitalist knows that its not little buyers who make money for a
> company in the long run, its the money that venture capitalists waste
> on entrepreneurs with sure-fire conventional ideas that makes them
> rich. Don't invest in DEXCOM - you will not regret it!
