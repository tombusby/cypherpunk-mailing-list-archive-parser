The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution,
Federalism, and Property Rights will hear testimony from  Cindy Cohn, lead
counsel in the Bernstein case on March 17, 1997.  

The hearing, entitled "Privacy in the Digital Age: Encryption and Mandatory
Access," will begin at 10:00 a.m. in Room 226 of the Dirksen Senate Office
Building.  The Subcommittee is chaired by Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri.  

Ms. Cohn will discuss the Bernstein case as well as the inherent
constitutional problems raised by the proposals for domestic cryptography
controls.

This will be the first time that the Congressional committees considering
proposed cryptography legislation have heard testimony from those directly
involved in the legal challenges the current regulations.  

The government's appeal of the Bernstein case, which was argued on December
8, 1997, is still pending with the 9th Circuit.  A decision is expected in
the next few months.
