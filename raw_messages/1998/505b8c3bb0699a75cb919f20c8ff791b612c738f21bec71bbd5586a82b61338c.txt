It works much the same as it does today, except that there isn't a
parasitic state wasting resources on feeding a useless band of
politicians, or pointing guns at people who don't obey its whims.

Oh yeah, like they'd be much more willing to bust their butts simply to
see 50%+ of it yanked away by "regulated" (by someone else) monopolies.

You can't have malignant monopolies in an anarchy.  If any monopoly
behaved in such a manner, it would be opening itself up wide for
competition.  The only way malignant monopolies can survive is by the
use of political power (i.e. force) to keep down competitors or to force
patronage. 

And exactly how is your paragraph related to the one you quote above it?

Ok, I'm going to tell this to you one more time, in simple words of no
more than three sylables.  I'll even put it in caps, so you can see it
easier:

LAWS DON'T GOVERN, PEOPLE DO.  

I keep pointing this out to you, and it keeps sliding in one eyeball and
out the other.  What's written on paper is *meaningless* if those in
power choose to abuse their positions.

Anarcho-capitalists are very aware of social mechanisms.  In fact, you
may have noticed that they are what we rely upon.  What you've been
talking about, however, are *political* mechanisms.  There's a
difference.

It's what you missed in the above paragraphs.  No government can prevent
something bad (i.e. the violation of individual rights) from happening. 
No government can keep you safe.  All any government can do is initiate
force after the fact, and this is *not* protection.

And why would that be?  I don't see any of them words written on them
sheets of paper getting up and standing guard around *my* house.  I just
see the actions of the people who are allegedly enforcing them.  Their
behavior is not always correlated to what's written on their sheets of
paper.

I don't say that all men are bad.  I simply say that not all men are
good.  

Furthermore, I say that no man is good enough to rule another.  This
applies to you, me, and everyone else.

You're *almost* there.  It means that all systems of state-governance
are broke.  I propose the abolition of the state  -the lack of such a
broken system.

Wow, that's very nationalistic of you.  Nationalism wasn't always the
way people viewed the world, you know, and society existed then.

You keep saying that the state and society are somehow synonymous.  This
is simply not true  --unless you're saying that if it were not for the
existance of an organization which tells other people what to do, all
human interaction would be impossible.

Heh, if you've been listening, you'd have noticed that I never said that
governments *have* rights -only that they assert that they have them.

There are no group rights, only individual rights.  Do you agree?  If
so, then how do you resolve the contradiction which develops when you
notice that members of the state apparently have the right to do things
that non-members cannot?  Specifically, the "right" to initiate force,
and the "right" to rule others? (both of which are of course non-rights,
in my view)

*Who* punishes the punishers?  You fool, who do you think is going to
tell the highest enforcer (who supposedly wields sufficient power to
enforce anything) what to do?

*sigh* I'll say it *again*.  If the rules are going to be ignored, it
doesn't _MATTER_ how they're written.

No one ever said that.  I'm sure crime will still exist.  Robbery,
murder, etc. People go insane sometimes, some are anti-social, etc. 
What we *won't* have, however, are such state-sponsored crimes like
taxation, "regulatory" taxes designed to keep competition away from
state sponsored monopolies, and, of course, that highest of all crimes,
the initiation of force on a worldwide scale.

Why?  Why wouldn't the services which people obviously need and want
suddenly vanish if the state didn't exist?  People are obviously going
to be willing to pay for services they want.  You think that mail, fire
protection, etc, wouldn't exist if they weren't state monopolies?  What
evidence do you have which supports this belief?  It certainly runs
counter to all available evidence (i.e. in *every other* service which
isn't monopolized by the state).

Read to the end of the paragraph, my dear fellow, and you will be
enlightened.  You really should be a little more patient before you
shoot off your mouth.

What's that?  Someone's running outside regulation in an anarchy?  Your
comment makes no sense in this context.

They'll be able to buy it with the money they save in taxes and reduced
prices due to the lack of taxation at each step in the production of the
goods they purchase.

Then they put out the fire, lest it spread uncontrollably to houses
which *are* covered by ABC insurance.  Then they present the homeowner
with a bill, who in turn presents the bill to his insurance company.

It is in the interest of the insurance companies (who run or finance the
fire depts.) to make it easy for people to contact a fire department. 
(it saves on claims).  

Of course, what would probably end up happening is that local fire
depts. would form, and be paid by insurance companies according to an
agreed upon rate.  A per-fire deal, if the frequency of fires is
sufficient to support this, or a flat rate (which is nicer for the
insurance companies, since they get to minimize their expenditures this
way).

Insurance companies don't have a problem collecting lots of small fees
if they don't have to pay large ones very often.

Significantly lower, overall, since we eliminate the middleman.

Yes, but I'd rather do it *without* having a gun pointed at my head.  I
like to be able to choose which organization I want to give my money to
(rather than having the decision made for me by armed men).  

Besides, money is fungible.  For all you or I know, 100% of the money
I've paid in taxes has gone to government boondoggles.

Perhaps the reason everyone hates each other so much these days is
because they all know, deep down, that they're being screwed over by (as
far as they can tell) everyone else.  And they are, via that amazing
organization, the state.
