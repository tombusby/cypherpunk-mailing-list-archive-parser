Again that is simply incorrect, or do you wish to tell me that our military
has not prevented the invasion of the continental US in this century, or
that it did not prevent the Soviet Union from expanding across Europe? You
cannot completely discount *deterrent force*, although it is greatly
overrated.

Nor can a government use *retribution force* if it does not know the
perpetrator.

Your statement boils down to the government is not omnipotent. Well duh!
