>      DETROIT (AP) -- Parents and legal experts have identified a problem
>      with Michigan standardized testing -- 122,000 fifth-graders provided
>      their fingerprints without permission.
>      
>      The public-school children had to fill out a "Fingerprint
>      Investigation Journal" as part of the science segment on the
>      Michigan Educational Assessment Program.
>      
>      "It's offensive," said Andrea Lang of St. Clair Shores, who learned
>      that her 10-year-old daughter provided fingerprints for the test
>      last week. "It's an invasion of privacy. Only criminals get their
>      fingerprints taken."
>      
>      The fingerprint journal was merely a hands-on experiment designed to
>      make the science portion of the test more interesting, Peter Bunton
>      of the MEAP office, said Wednesday.
>      
>      State law says that with few exceptions, children's fingerprints
>      can't be obtained without parents' permission. Bunton said he was
>      unaware of the law.
