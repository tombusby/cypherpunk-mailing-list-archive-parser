There's some discussion on the BBC about that Chinese businessman who's now in
the klink for "conspiring against the state using the internet" :-).

The Beeb has an internet correspondent, and he's, right now, talking about
strong crypto, anonymous remailers, and quoting Gilmore's censorship is damage
line. All without using the words "strong cryptography", or "anonymous
remailers", or "John Gilmore". :-).

He was talking about how the Chinese website was hacked within hours and
painted over with pro democracy stuff and links to Amnesty International,
among other things.

All of this was in a favorable, horse is out of the barn, this is good for
freedom, light.

Cheers,
Robert Hettinga
