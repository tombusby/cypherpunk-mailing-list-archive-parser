                                          Results Announcement:

N. Ferguson, , "Upper Bounds on Differential Characteristics in Twofish," Twofish Technical Report #1, Counterpane Systems, Aug 1998.

                                                     Abstract:
In our initial paper the Twofish block cipher was introduced, and initial estimates of an upper bounds on the probability of a 12-round differential were given. These results used an imperfect model of Twofish. We present an improved model, and show that any 12-round differential characteristic has a probability of at most $2^{-102.8}$.


This paper is available at http://www.counterpane.com/twofish.html, and will be made available 
at the AES Workshop next week.

Cheers,
Bruce
