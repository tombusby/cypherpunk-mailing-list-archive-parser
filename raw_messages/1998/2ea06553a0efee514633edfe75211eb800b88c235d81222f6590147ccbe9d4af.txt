Linda, here is a tidbit of information that you might get interested in...

The National Firearms Association has several times put a leash and curbed thoses rabbid dogs.  They procure you with ample legal information; just to point out to any govt bully how, per the letter of the law, they are committing a criminal act and how they could get charged.  THe thing is, if somebody comes from the states, it is unlikely that a) he/she will know Kanadian law and b) she/he will lay criminal charges.  The pertaining Kanadian laws should be widespread in the USA and maybe a cross-border entity could exist to promote the proper conduct of govt bully?

In any case, I suggest you ask the NFA about the whole thing of goods confiscation and criminal charges at the border.  Recently, there was a US citizen that entered Kanada with a handgun in his toolbox in his car trunk.  Oh, what a mess.  Here in Kanada, where the good Liberal dictators are convinced that Man is an intrinsically rabbid animal that will kill as soon as he has the means to layed criminal charges and seized this poor US chap cars and belongings and put him in the klink for a while.  Of course, in the US, a handgun could legitimately be carried in your toolbox and it is normal not to think of it as a *big thing* (tm), so it is legitimate to not think of it at the moment of border crossing.  Anyways, that's it, what happenend happened.  The NFA, I think, is working on it.

My telling of the story is subject to all sort of distortions and should not be considered reliable...  :-)  Contact the NFA and the Canadian Firearms Digest home page for more details...
