Hello,

It has come to my attention that the KRAP (key recovery alliance program)
has submitted an I-D (internet draft) to the IETF for adding GAK
(government access to keys) to the IPSEC protocols:

ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rfced-exp-markham-00.txt

ISAKMP Key Recovery Extensions
<draft-rfced-exp-markham-00.txt>

   Phone: 651.628.2754,    Fax:   651.628.2701
   EMail: tom_markham@securecomputing.com


I consider this a perversion of the standards process of the IETF to
advance a political agenda which must be stopped at all cost.

Below are the e-mail addresses of some people that you should write
(politely) expressing your objections to any such additions to the
protocols:

IPSEC Chairs:

Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>
Robert Moskowitz <rgm@icsa.net>

Security Area Directors:

Jeffrey Schiller <jis@mit.edu>
Marcus Leech <mlecch@nortel.ca>

As I mentioned before, be polite. These people are not the ones proposing
GAK be added to the IPSEC protocols. They have put a lot of time and
effort in forwarding the cause for strong encryption. They should be made
aware of the communities objections to these attempts by KRAP.

Thanks,
