I think we are in violent agreement here ...

Except that it seems odd that speech is no longer 1st amendment
protected as soon as it can be interpreted by a machine to do something.
So, then, if I want to deny you first amendment protections for
something, I can simply write a compiler to turn your words into machine
executable code, and suddenly, your words are no longer protected
speech.  How could that be a reasonable interpretation of functional
versus not?

Secondly, Gwin said that encryption is a special class of software which
is MORE functional.  This is definitely a misunderstanding, to say the
least.  I don't see how any particular class of software is necessarily
more or less functional than other classes of software.  In the
functional sense, all software, when compiled and executed is
functional, period (whether it performs according to its original design
is irrelevant).

	Gwin has written a phrase which deserves more analysis, IMO --
free
	from political overtones if we want to be impartial. The phrase
can
	be reworded as:

	  "source code is a device, that actually does a function"

	The difference and importance here is between syntatic and
semantics. 

	Your 4-instruction source code above is not a device today -- it
	cannot perform any function. It has only syntatics, not the "how
to". 
	But, if there were a machine that could supply the proper
semantics
	(ie, actually perform the functions 1-4) then your source code
above
	would be a device.  Further, your source code may not be a
device
	today but be a device tomorrow.

	As another example, bringing together one pound of inert metal
with
	another one pound of the same inert metal was not considered to
be
	explosive -- until U235 was used for the inert metal and
properly
	compressed. The difference is semantic, not syntatic. 

	In that, Gwin is correct. Can the source code actually perform a
	function?  Then, it is a device. Irrespective of the needed
platform,
	in the same way that an electric shaver is a device irrespective
of
	the local availablity of an appropriate power outlet.

	IMO, even though I consider Gwin to be correct to a very large
	extent, widespread use of crypto will not come from lifiting
such
	bans ... but from real need -- which does not outweigh the
hassle,
	today. The EFF has a wrong target there. 

	Do you know how much Internet e-mail traffic is encrypted today?
Can
	you believe less than 10%? Notwithstanding the rethoric
exercises and
	limelight it may provide, talking about encryption export bans
may
	not be as effective as desigining better and easier uses of
strong
	crypto -- that can then really drive market, legislation and
courts. 

	Need to use is a better key than need to know, it seems.

	Cheers,

	Ed Gerck
