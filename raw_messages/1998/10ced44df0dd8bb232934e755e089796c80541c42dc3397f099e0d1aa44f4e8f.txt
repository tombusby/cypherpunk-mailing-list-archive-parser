Sicherheit und Privat will be issuing digital cash, digital letters of
credit, and use a secret-sharing crypto app on a Pilot to handle stock
trading. A bunch of cypherpunk regulars, including Black Unicorn, are
involved.

Below is my writeup that's in this week's Time magazine. For details check

A VIRTUAL SWISS BANK FOR THE REST OF US

Time Magazine

Got the urge for offshore banking but not the cash to try
it? Rather than saving up for a plane ticket to Grand
Cayman, check out a new online bank opening its virtual
doors this week. Sicherheit und Privat (Security and
Privacy) is an Austrian bank that offers encrypted
communications, digital cash transactions and a
privacy-protected MasterCard for a minimum deposit of
$1,000 (as opposed to $10K to $50K in a typical Swiss
bank). Could be just the thing for low rollers trying to
hide cash from a spouse's divorce lawyers--or the IRS.
