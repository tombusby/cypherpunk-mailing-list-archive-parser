ppdd is an advanced encrypted file system for i386 Linux only.

It is used in a similar way to the loop device and offers simplicity and
speed plus full strength encryption (128 bit).

The design takes into consideration the fact that data on disc has a
long lifetime and that an attacker may have the matching plaintext to
much of the cyphertext.

A combination of master/working pass phrases offers enhanced security
for backup copies.

Current status is BETA and comments on the
implemenation and underlying crypography are most welcome.

It consists of a kernel patch plus support programs and is intended
for users with enough knowledge to compile the kernel, setup lilo,
partition disks etc. It is not for absolute beginners or "non technical"
users just yet.
