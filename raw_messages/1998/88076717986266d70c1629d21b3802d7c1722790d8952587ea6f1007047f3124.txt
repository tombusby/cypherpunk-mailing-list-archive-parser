But it can be, and the costs of doing so aren't much higher than
storing it for the first couple of years.  Depends on what service
the customer wants to buy.  And there are applications that
require more than 100 years of data protection, e.g. ownership
of copyrights which last 50 years beyond the author's death.

But for Matt Barrie's question, any permanent document will do.

Hard to say.  Assuming that Quantum Cryptography doesn't allow
finite-sized computers to do large exponentially complex calculations
in short finite time, you're probably limited by the number of atoms
in the available supply of planets, and Heisenberg may still get you
if that's not a low enough limit.  Moore's law isn't forever.
But there's no particular reason to limit RC4 or RC5 to 128 bits;
those are convenient sizes for MD5 hashes of passphrases.
So if you're paranoid, use RC4-256 and superencrypt with 5-DES.
				Thanks!
