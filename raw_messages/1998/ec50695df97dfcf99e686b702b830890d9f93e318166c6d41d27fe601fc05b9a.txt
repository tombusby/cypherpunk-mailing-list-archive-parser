> WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Clinton directed his government Saturday to
> find a way to close a legal loophole that allows speakers/journalists to
> express their ideas at public places with no questions asked.
> In his weekly radio address, Clinton said a ``dangerous trend'' is emerging
> at seminars and radio talk shows because the First Amendment permits people
> to express their ideas without background checks.
> ``Some of these talk shows have become a heaven for criminals and hate
> speech mongers looking to sway people on a no-questions-asked basis,''
> Clinton said.
> He directed Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Attorney General Janet Reno
> to report back to him in 60 days with a plan to close the loophole in the
> Bill of Rights and to prohibit any free speech without a background check.
> ``I believe this should be the law of the land: No background check, no free
> speech, no exceptions,'' Clinton said.
> In a fact sheet, the White House said that every week about 35 million
> people regularly listen to an estimated 50 conservative radio personalities
> such as Rush Limbaugh and G. Gordon Liddy.
> On Nov. 30, 1999 the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System
> is set to take effect to allow quicker checks and approve speech licenses
> sales within minutes.
> In addition, on Nov. 30, 1999 the law will be strengthened in two ways:
> purchases of all speech licenses, not just political, will be subject to
> Reno background checks as will Kinko's printing services, which are four
> times as likely to involve a prohibited printed opinions.
> Overall, the White House said, it is estimated that the number of background
> checks conducted nationally will increase from 0 million to between 10 and
> 12 million.
> Unregulated speech are ``an open invitation to criminals and right wing
> crazies,'' said Janet Reno, who chairs SpeechControl Inc. The Clinton law
> was named after the President, who was wounded in verbal attacks first
> launched by radio personality Rush Limbaugh in 1992.
> California and Maryland regulate ``hate speech'', said Reno. Florida voters
> passed a constitutional amendment Tuesday giving counties the power to
> require a waiting period and a background check for speech at public places.
