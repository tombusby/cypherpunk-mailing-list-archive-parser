Zero-Knowledge has put up a draft of a whitepaper explaining the technical
details of it's coming Freedom Internet Privacy system.

The paper discusses the technical details of our AnonymousIP protocol and
our Pseudonymous E-mail System.

This is an early draft and comments/questions are appreciated.

People familiar with Mixmaster, PipeNet, Cypherpunk Remailers and Onion
Routing will find this whitepaper to address many of the same problems with
regards to Internet Anonymity & Privacy.

The paper is available at http://www.zks.net/products/whitepapers.asp

Thanks,

Austin
