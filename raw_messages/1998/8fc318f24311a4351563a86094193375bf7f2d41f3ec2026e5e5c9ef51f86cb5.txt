Hello,

The IRS and United States Attorney's office are looking for assistance
in a criminal investigation involving threatening messages which were
posted to the Cypherpunks mailing list.  This e-mail address was noted
to be one of those which receives the Cypherpunks list.  I would
appreciate it if you would contact me to discuss whether you would be
willing to assist us in this matter, and what records or information you
have relating to the Cypherpunks list.  You can contact me at this
e-mail address or at (503) 326-2787.

Thanks

Jeff
