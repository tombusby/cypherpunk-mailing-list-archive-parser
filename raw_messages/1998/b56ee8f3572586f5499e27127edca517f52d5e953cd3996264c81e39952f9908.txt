> An unregulated (free-market) economy will inherently monopolize when, but
> not necessarily only if, the following are present:

 -  initialy prices for services will be low to promote purchasing but
    as providers obtain larger market shares their prices will increase
    over time and out of step with inflation and other market forces in
    order to widen the profit gap. The strategy is one of 'use it or
    starve'.
