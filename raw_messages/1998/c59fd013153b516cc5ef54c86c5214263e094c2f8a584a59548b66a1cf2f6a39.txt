Compression efficiency depends upon 1) the entropy of the input data, 2) the allowable losses and 3) finding an efficient algorithm to code for that entropy.  

For example, text rarely compress w/o loss beyond 4-5 to 1 (and 2-3 is more typical) using LZW (the defacto standard algorithm).  Images have much more correlation in their data (and therfore can be compressed more readily), but even so lossless compression beyond 3-5 to 1 is uncommon (e.g., TIFF).  JPG and other lossy algorithms need no apply.

I think I'm on fairly firm ground assuming that key data entropy is very high and therefore little or no compressible is feasible.
