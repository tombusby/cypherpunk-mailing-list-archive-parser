Subject: Re: Settlement and talk title

  Bill,

  I cannot comment on your legal battles - they seem to be quite
  difficult and require a great deal of courage if waged against a
  government.

  I wish you the best of luck - it sounds like a nightmare or as written
by
  Kafka.

  Anyway, the title for your talk sounds very interesting. Could you
also
  write up an  abstract and make it reasonably technical, because this
is what people
  will  be interested in.

  I'm looking forward, once you have your passport, to arrange a date
with
  you to come here for the interview and to meet us.

  Kind regards
       Matthias

My talk title was

	Dangers in High Tech Espionage

GETTING CAUGHT, of course, is one DANGER in high tech espionage.

Let's all hope for settlement of this UNFORTUNATE MATTER before things
GET
WORSE.

Later
