Sorry but there are absolutes and there is a moral yardstick.  Whether this
 is accepted or not is beside the point.

There has to be absolutes otherwise any action can be excused (or damned).
  The real cry should be
"God help us to instigate Your yardstick".  God doesn't change and neither
does His measure.

1)Love the Lord, with all your heart, with all you soul with all your mind
and all your strength
2)Love you neibour as yourself.

Everything else hangs on these.
