We're not discussin stego, we're discussing hidden disk partitions, not
hiding data in the lsb of of existing observable disk partitions or
something similar.

Considering the cost of such a scanner (a few $10k/ea.) and assuming such
masking technology were to become commen place I doubt if very many
customs checkpoints at major transfer hubs wouldn't have them.

I suspect it would be several k actualy since it is going to have to
include the encryption code, device drivers, wedgers, etc.

A disassembler isn't a a debugger. All a disassembler does is convert the
hex to symbols (see frankenstein for an excellent design).

So much for your few hundred bytes.

Um, usualy they support wedging via a jump table. This means that not only 
do you still have the original code you wedged out but you have the new
code you've wedged in. A 2x penalty.

Nobody says it can't be done.

With only a few dozen BIOS'es driving the whole kit and kaboodle.

They're new, they will learn from their mistakes and it won't take long.
After all, they have your tax dollars to use...
