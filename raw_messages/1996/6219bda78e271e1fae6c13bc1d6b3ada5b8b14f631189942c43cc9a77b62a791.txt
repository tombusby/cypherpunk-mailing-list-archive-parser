Actually... we might as well print up the t-shirts, and sell them for $15
apeice, then buy a DES cracker with the profit ;)

Seriously though, I'd by the t-shirt, and I'll donate processor time.  I
can definatly give an 8086 (BALK) to the process, some time on a 80386,
and a limited amount of time on some p75's...
