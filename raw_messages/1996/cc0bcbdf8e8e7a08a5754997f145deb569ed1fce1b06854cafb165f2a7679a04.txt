Why do you need to pressurize the drive?  Most hard disk drives
for the last N years have been airtight sealed containers,
haven't they?  (Removables are different, of course.)

I'd worry far more about the stresses of launch bothering
the drives.

You do obviously want RAID and/or mirrored drives.

Most government space computer equipment has expensive RAD-hardended RAM;
it's much cheaper and probably more effective to just use conventional
RAM with ECC and shield it a bit.  At least at one time, the most powerful
computer on the Space Shuttle was the Compaq 386/25 laptop that one
of the astronauts brought along for some non-mission-critical work;
most of the built-in computers were 1 MIPS or less.

Yup.  Ego would be a good motivation, if you know somebody with enough
spare cash :-)

While it would be nice to have satellites around all the time,
even one or two smallsats could provide services on a several-times-daily
basis which would be enough to do private email.
