I'm using an essentially identical setup to jdoe-0007's
and I can't get it to work either.  It worked nicely under
Win31 and Eudora 2.1.2, but Win95 and Eudora 2.2(32) don't
play nice with Eudora.

It might be a bits thing (sixteen versus thirty-two)...

ObCrypto: Um, well, this note is PGP clearsigned?
(Seriously, this discussion ought to be Cc:ed to Joel, and/or
taken off the list.)
