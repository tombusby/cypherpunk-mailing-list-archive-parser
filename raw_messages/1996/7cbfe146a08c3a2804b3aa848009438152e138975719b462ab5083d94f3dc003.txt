Nice try, but no cigar.  The problem with all of the "ITAR loophole" ideas
is that they only work where the rules are clearly articulated and carefully
followed by the administrative agencies.  Neither of those exist with the
ITAR..  There are no restrictions on the ODTC's ability to interpret the
ITAR however they see fit and to change those interpretations as they wish
to meet their goal: stopping folks from getting strong crypto easily.  

The best example of this is the mislabelled "crypto with a hole,"  in which
ODTC interprets the regulations as allowing them to limit software with no
cryptography in it at all but only hooks which could allow the insertion of
crypto later.  The ITAR says that they only regulate "software with the
capability of maintaining secrecy" and so on its face would not extend to
software which only has hooks for crypto.  But this doesn't stop ODTC and
there is no mechanism in place to allow anyone else to  stop them short of a
lawsuit or a change in the law by Congress.

So, having said that, here's where I think they could fit in the "piracy"
sublicense maneuver:

First, entering into the sublicensing agreement could be interpreted as a
"defense service."  By giving them a license you are "assisting the foreign
person" because, presumably, life is easier for them if they have a license.

Second, call the sub-license agreement "technical data" since it is related
to the crypto.

Or, as they did with Zimmermann, they just assume that the company had
something to do with the unauthorized export and begin an investigation.  If
it goes to indictment, better hope you have iron-clad evidence to convince
the jury that you had nothing to do with it.  If  you've gone ahead and
sub-licensed afterwards, making money off of the illegal act, I think it
would be difficult to convince a jury that you didn't have something to do
with it.  

Gotta write a brief now,

Cindy Cohn
