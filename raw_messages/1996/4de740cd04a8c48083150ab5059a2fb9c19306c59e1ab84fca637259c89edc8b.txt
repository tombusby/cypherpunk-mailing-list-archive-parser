Not buying it and not installing it would appear to be an easy way to "opt out."

(Unless the rumors are true that U.S. Programmer-General Janet Reno will
soon propose "software registration escrow," a voluntary program to meet
the legitimate needs of law enforcement by requiring the voluntary
installation of such programs as Oil Change. Know as "GAP," for "Government
Access to Programs," this system will ensure that child pornographers and
nuclear terrorists will not get access to forbidden programs.)
