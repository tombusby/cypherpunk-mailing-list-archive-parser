Since we posted the item below to c'punks this morning, I see 
that WSJ and Financial Times have stories on the News 
Datacom tax fraud raid.

Perhaps Shamir has not been actually arrested, maybe only
implicated. Anyone in Jerusalem know more?

   In a coincidence with the Biham/Shamir smart card attack,
   AP reports October 20 on an Israeli raid of News Datacom
   Research for $150 million tax fraud, allegedly because
   locally developed crypto products were smuggled out of
   the country. News Datacom develops and markets encryption
   systems for pay-TV based on Shamir's work, and he is a
   part-owner.

   Recall that Markoff's story on DFA cited Bahim's
   experience with pirate-TV and smart-card tampering.

   Financial Times ran stories last May about the company's 
   financial derring-do, which we've placed with the AP 
   report at:

   We've also put the Biham/Shamir DFA post and NYT article
   at:
