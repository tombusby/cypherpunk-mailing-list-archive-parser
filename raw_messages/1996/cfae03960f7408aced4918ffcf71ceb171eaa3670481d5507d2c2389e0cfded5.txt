Vernor,

What's your thinking on some privacy protection measures for these types of
"embedded systems?" Shouldn't these kinds of "instruments" (one
ringy-dingy) have some user-defeats or -definable permissions settings
built in from Day One?

Do we risk e$ accounts being billed automatically by water/gas/electric
meters on a daily basis without the possibility of users disputing the
readings in a timely way? Is anyone proposing permissions on such boxes?
What're the proposals, if any, for how the automated calls they make get
billed, get scheduled and show up on customer phone bills? I wonder if the
bills decrease, since this all saves the companies lots of money?

I'm all for "smart houses" but I'd prefer they learn the tricks _I_ teach 'em.
