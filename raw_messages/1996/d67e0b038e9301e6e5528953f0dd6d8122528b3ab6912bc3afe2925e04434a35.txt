rights or NAFTA/GATT and ignore everything else.  These are important 
issues, but they aren't the only ones.  And any support from netters will 
fall after arguing about everything else.

...and the sad thing is you might well shoot yourself in the foot for 
voting against somebody over one or two issues.  I know people who'd vote 
for anybody but Clinton.  They babble about Clinton being a "socialist" 
<chuckle> so much that they'd end up voting for a National Socialist <not 
funny either...!>

as much to maintain.
