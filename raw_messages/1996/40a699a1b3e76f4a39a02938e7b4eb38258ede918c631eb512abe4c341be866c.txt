Today on 22nd of August the local court of first instance in
Helsinki decided that Johan Helsingius has to reveal the email
adress asked for by the Police Department of Helsinki. This has to
be done within 30 days when summoned for interrogation.

Since this is merely a part of a case, this decision can't be
appealed. If Helsingius still refuses to reveal the info he will be
repeatedly fined and ultimately jailed for up to six months. The
decisions about fines and jail can be appealed, but an appeal won't
stay the execution of the ordered fine/jail, only a judgement of the
appeals court will. The questions about different appeals in this
case are somewhat complex and regarding the possibility to appeal it
was a split decision (4-1).

The court ruled against Helsingius in this matter. During the
hearing Helsingius argued against this view in many ways: he
objected on constitutional grounds and on grounds relating to
statutes regarding criminal investigation.

This information is based mainly on message <4vi0tt$geq@idefix.eunet.fi>
in the local Finnish newsgroup sfnet.keskustelu.laki, by Kaj Malmberg,
the police officer in charge of the investigation of the matter where
Scientology scriptures were posted through anon.penet.fi.

More reports from this case will probably follow soon.
