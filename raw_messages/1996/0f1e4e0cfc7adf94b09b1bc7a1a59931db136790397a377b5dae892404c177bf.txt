Quite!  I wish somebody would ask her why such a tiny fraction of the 
population (government functionaries, and a small fraction of them to 
boot!) should get their way and force (with varying degrees of the word, 
force) their idea of heaven on the rest of us.  Despite their claims of an 
"emerging consensus", only an extraordinarily small group thought up GAK and 
has been promoting it.  Whatever benefits are claimed for that system, I've 
always contended that we (as citizens; or, as individuals) should have the 
right to reject it.  Are they unwilling to take NO for an answer?
