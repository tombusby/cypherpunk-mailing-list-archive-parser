The nature of anonimity, IMO, precludes any legal mechanism since the 
anonymity structure was established precisely to avoid any legal 
consequences.

Here, I might be tempted to differeciate between two cases:
1) the entity who wants to get out of the reach of the governmental 
system
2) the entity who wants to get out of the reach of everybody (to con 
others)

The only problem is, how will you differentiate between 1) and 2) 
*before* a conflict arises?

  The involved party would then have to resort to use 
some sort of unofficial tribunal.  It would create a set of parrallel 
law system, and as much of them as there would be groups doing 
business together.

Again, depending on the context, AP might wery well be the only 
solution or be no workable solution at all.

But here, I think that AP would be the single most important factor
ruling the socio-economical behavior of individuals or entities in
the world.  It already works that way in many countries of the
world, especially in south america.  In many places, you don't screw
around too much or you get killed.  As a friend of mine who lived in
the jungle told me "if a guy fools around with you wife, you just
shut up and take it, but if a guy fools around with your girlfriend,
you have the sorcerer mix you a beverage...  One of my friend had
one and he died within ten days..."

He said: "This system might very well go against our common moral
principles, but in theses places, you can leave anything on the
public place for several days and when you come back, it'll still be
there.  In theses countries, when you give your word, it *is*
binding.  Most business deals are simply verbal and there is an
astonishing low level of defaulting on them.  Thoses who tend to
default dishonestly tend very much to die quickly.  In thoses
countries, no con man ever survives."

Any physical currency can be made traceable (put a chemical or
radioactive tracer or a zillion other tricks...)
