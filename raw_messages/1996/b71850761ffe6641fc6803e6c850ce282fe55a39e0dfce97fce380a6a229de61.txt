If I were as worried about Java security as Perry is, I would still
consider running Java (or C or C++) programs as part of certain markets in
CPU cycles because I would trust their source.  (IMHO, much better than
trusting every web page I access.)

A single example.  I could see a network-wide factoring attack on the key
NSA uses to GAK the extra bits in Lotus Notes.  Such an effort would run a
single program, which would be available in source.  Depending on the
details, I could either compile the program locally, or down load a signed
copy of the object code/class file.  The same argument applies to rendering
e.g. Toy Story.

This restriction does not provide for CPU cycle markets in arbitrary
programs, but I think that a significant market could still develop under
this limit.
