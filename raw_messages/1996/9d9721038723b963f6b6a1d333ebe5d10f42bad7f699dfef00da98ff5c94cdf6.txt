	Exactly how little can a remailer log and still keep adequate
functionality? I may be setting up one or two Mixmaster-type
to-other-remailers-only remailers sometime this summer (with one at Lance
Cottrell's company so I can get his help easier...), so it is a practical
question.... and one the answer to which may depend on whether one is
remailing to another remailer, or to a public setting, or to an email
address, or from an email address, etcetera.
