Or the more positive way of looking at things:

"If he had been using digital dead drops instead of old-fashioned
postcards, and if he'd been using more sophisticated money management
schemes instead of simple deposits after trips to Europe, he might not have
been caught."

(By the way, it's the dumb and/or careless ones who get caught. I surmise
that for every one caught, an average of two are still spying. And they
probably _are_ wiping their hard drives more carefully, probably _are_
using digital dead drops (a la message pools), and probably _are_ having
their fees wired directly to their offshore accounts.)
