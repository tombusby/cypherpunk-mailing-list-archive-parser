Was one use however I seem to recall citations dating back to Niccolo Polo
reguarding the use of trade codes & that was a while before the telegraph.
If I were really curious, would also check out Reuters, Lloyds, Rothchilds,
and the Borgias. Would not be surprised to find a reference in either/all
"The Prince", "The Art of War",  and the letters of Nathan Hale.

However I suspect that Markoff really meant to be referring to mathematical
algoritms such as the LOASDR. I suppose that only dates back to the
diameters of stygi (sp ?) about the same time that passwords were first 
recorded (and changed daily).
						Warmly,

ps if anyone has a spare LOASDR or CMSDR, I would be interested 8*).
