In addition, encryption isn't performed until after the ClientFinished
and ServerFinished messages, no matter which CipherSuites are negotiated.


I don't know what MSIE looks like, but I'd guess that somewhere in
it there is a screen similar to Netscape's for configuring SSL.
In Netscape you can select which CipherSuites to use, including
"No encryption with an MD5 MAC".  If you turn off the "No encryption.."
CipherSuites in MSIE, you should get an encrypted connection.
