Sure, you could probably write http://www.g-rated.com/.
At least with movie ratings, the MPAA has trademarked the G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17
ratings so that producers can't self-rate their own movies (though they
can self-rate them as X.)  But you could delete the ratings.

Presumably, almost nobody in Europe is going to add these silly Yankee
rating labels to their web pages, except a few commercial content providers
who want to sell advertising or services into markets that block
un-rated web pages.  So schoolkids behind rating-mandatory sites
will have to ask their teachers why the "World-Wide-Web" is just American ---
"It's got All 50 States, Johnny!"   <Exonive deleted>!

Tamper-proofing is a far more general issue than just ratings.
Most of the tampering today is either political protest (the see-your-
favorite-web-pages-after-censorship site), quasi-silliness 
(the Great Web Canadianizer, eh?), or advertising addition from commercial sites
or deletion from de-commercialization software.
Imagine if your movie rating web page gets linked up by some studio-owned
web site (www.disney.not/reviews/siskel+ebert/Rocky23 says "Two Thumbs Up!"
"Rave!")
Or your stock picking service gets arbitraged a bit on fast.make.money.com.
Or the ExonOnLine webserver starts deleting all links to unrated pages
from pages it serves.

If you don't need it now, you'll need it soon enough.
