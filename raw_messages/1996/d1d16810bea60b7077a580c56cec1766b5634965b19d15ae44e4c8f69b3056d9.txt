Well, I can think of a few reasons to come to that conclusion.  

- Schlafly is the head of one of the more right-wing organizations in the
country.  

- She is very closly associated with the Buchanon campaign and the Christian
coalition.  

- Her organization, the Eagle Forum, distributes a couple of anti-porn rant
tracts (http://www.eagleforum.org/users/eagle/public_html/misc/order.html)
called _Pornography's Victims $4.95 (paperback) by Schlafly, ed._ and
_Pornography Addict (Bundy Interview)_.  (Quoting Bundy is interesting in
this context, because he never collected porn, he collected cheerleading
magazines.  His "death bed confession" was a ploy to gain publicity and
sympathy out of a gulible ant-porn zealot.)

>Does Jim know who Phyllis' son is?

I know that he is gay.  His mother seems to have had some problems coming to
terms with the implications of alot of her rhetoric involving such things...
(She seems to confuse her religion with reality on this point.)

I would say there are alot of reasons to assume that Schlafly would try and
impose her morality on the rest of the country if given half the chance.
Look at the people she chooses to associate with.
