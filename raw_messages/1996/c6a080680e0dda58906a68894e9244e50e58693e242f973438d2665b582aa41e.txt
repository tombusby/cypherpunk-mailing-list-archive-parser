Actually I just set-up a Twit/Auto-Reply filter for my email client. If you make it onto my twit filter all messages are bounced with a message to stop sending mail. I don't even know the message was sent to me unless I check my logfile.

If someone really pisses me off some creative mail-bombing tend to get the message accross.
