Couldn't the proxy be configured to deny access to all "unrated" pages?
Of course, this would mean that some kind of standardized web page rating
system be devised; however, I think there are already several proposals for
rating schemes.  BTW, does anyone know how such a proxy system could be
used in all Internet traffic, not just the web.  It is not very difficult
to get a gopher client or telnet client to communicate with a web server,
bypassing any access restrictions.

ObCrypto: The next step would be a rating system using digital signatures
and the proxy software being setup to trust certain signatures more than
others.
