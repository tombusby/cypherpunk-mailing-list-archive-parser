Does Java have a run-time way to do
        #if_exists library_X
                foo = library_X.method_a(bar, baz)
        #else
                foo = library_Y.method_a(bar, baz)
        #endif
or equivalent?  This would let you distribute a slow pure-java library
that's compatible to a native-mode library and use whichever you need.
