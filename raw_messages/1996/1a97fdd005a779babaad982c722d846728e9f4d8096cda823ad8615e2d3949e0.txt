	Well, actually it's on a lot of other things also, including ones that
those against censorship (I assume you're on the fight-censorship list, and
thus encountered both Declan and Rich?) should favor. Examples include
anonymous remailers and web pages (the deceanse (sp) project).
	Moreover, anonymous digital cash has applications to fighting
censorship. Applications include paying someone to remail information or to
put it on the web. c2.org, for instance, accepts even the present
semi-anonymous digital cash and offers anonymous web page hosting.

	That depends on how one defines "fair."

	Most of the tracking and other mechanisms discussed are even more of
a threat to liberty - most significantly privacy, although there are other
ones involved as well - and, indeed, to economic efficiency. A lot of the
proposed and/or instituted regulations can also be used to discourage various
politically unpopular but economically efficient operations; an example is
"capital flight."
	In other words, unless you really want to live under a set of laws as
restrictive as those in Communist China, support the cypherpunks.
