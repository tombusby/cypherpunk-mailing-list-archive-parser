I agree completely... the existence of a "national cryptography policy"
is a basic violation of the civil rights of every citizen in this country,
and should be dealt with as such.  The only reason for a government to
control the use of cryptography is to prevent its citizens from protecting
themselves against the activities of that government. 

It's analogous to removing freedom of public assembly.

The government "relaxing" crypto controls is like Hitler saying, "ok, ok,
I promise not to be SUCH a fascist."

   numerous idiot lights which plague the modern driver.  Rather, if the
   driver makes any mistake, a giant "?" lights up in the center of the
   dashboard.  "The experienced driver", he says, "will usually know
   what's wrong."
