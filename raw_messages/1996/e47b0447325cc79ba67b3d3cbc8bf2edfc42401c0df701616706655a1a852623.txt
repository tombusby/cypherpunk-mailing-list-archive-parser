I believe the answer is nothing ... but the situation is no different than
Carol going into Le Sexxey Shoppey, buying a porn-pack of restricted
material, and then giving it to Bob.

As has been said in this forum and others before, in the limit all access
control comes down to positive identification of an individual.  Unless We,
the People, want to support permanently binding a traceable, non-anonymous
identity to all certificate attributes that are used in electronic exchange
(age, etc...) then there is going to be the potential for someone to
deliberately allow their credential to be misused.

IMO, to prevent this totally would require implanting a non-forgable i.d.
chip in everyone at birth ..... not very appealing.
