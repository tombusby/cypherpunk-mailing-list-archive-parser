I as you should know, I have never said that base64 should never be used.
I merely say that signatures should be taken over the original binary data.
Base64 can be used for transport as needed, but it should be a convention
that the any base64 is removed before signatures are checked.

Using this convention, it is easy to see that the node that strips encryption
could add base64 without invalidating the signature, because of the
convention that the base64 so added will be removed before the signature
is checked on the original binary data.

It should allow users to use it in such a fashion! PGP MIME should
respect the wishes of the users! Software should not view users
as tools to accomplish some goal predetermined by developers, but it
should rather make it easy for the user to accomplish what the user
wants! This attitude of service causes software to be in harmony with
market forces and leads to success! (Market forces apply to freware/guiltware/
copylefted/public domain software as well as software for sale or licence.)

By existing in a context of service, PGP MIME can make encryption
easy to use and become widespread. By doing so, it can entrench
the widespread use of encryption, making it politicly impossible to
regulate it! Thus, it can confound the evil plans of those dark forces
that seek to enslave us all!

As my examples show, some users may have legitimate reasons for
wishing to attach a generally useful PGP signature to a MIME message.

Not all users are technically sophisticated, it would be nice if PGP_MIME
could accommodate such wishes.

Digital signatures are an unrevokable record of what a person believes
and attests to at a given time. Belief is an attribute of persons, that
is not subject to command, certainly not by a piece of software.

PGP MIME should allow users to sign those documents the user wishes
to sign, faithfully transmitting those signatures to the receiver. It should 
not dictate that a user will sign an unintelligible artifact of a data 
transmission system.

You are ignoring an already exiting binary transport, that exists right now.
Namely, PGP provides a BINARY datapath for its plaintext!

In the future, other binary transports will become more common.
7 bit datapaths will become less common.
Pressure will build for PGP MIME to support binary datapaths.

PGP MIME will have to go through a complicated migration path
to phase in this transition. All this complexity can be avoided by
doing the right thing now.

Make the method of representing the data for signatures independent
of the representation of the data for transport!

It might take some effort for PGP-MIME annalists and developers now.
But that effort, will be more than repaid by saving people the hassle
of having to clean up an intolerable mess later!

I do not see exactly how this should be done for multipart messages
in detail right now. That is why I have not made a specific proposal.
But I do see that it should be possible to come up with such a representation.

That is why I say that the draft should be withdrawn and sent back
for further study.

The typical user does not necessarily know the difference between
a .gif and a .jpg file. He only knows he wants to send this pretty picture
on the screen.

Users should have a policy of only attesting to statements by digital
signature, that they know _of their own personal knowledge_ is true.
Any other policy is to court disaster.

If Malley ( the active message hacker ) hacks the content-type
MIME line, all that will happen is that the message to be sent
to the .gif viewer rather than the .jpg viewer, causing the message
to be lost. But Malley already had the ability to loose the message,
after all, he hacked it didn't he? In general, the content type line
should not be signed.

If some technically advanced user wants to sign the content-type
line, his wishes should be accommodated. But it should not be made
a requirement that technically unsophisticated users attest to things
they have no hope of understanding!

I have gotten the impression that you guys have stopped listening.
Everyone seems hell-bent on standardizing this inferior system that
will lockin a poor design. I hoped that by appealing to a larger
audience I could get more articulate and respected people to
persuade you to rethink. Perhaps some of the cypherpunks can
say something that will provoke an attack of sanity that will
stop this inexorable march toward a bad standard.

In the specific case I mentioned, (signed & encrypted) it is not necessary
for transport. It is only necessary for transport under your mis-designed
system whereby signatures must be taken over entities designed for
transport.
