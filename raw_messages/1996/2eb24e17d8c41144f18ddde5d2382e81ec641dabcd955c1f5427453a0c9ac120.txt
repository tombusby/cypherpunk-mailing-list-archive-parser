>Howard Stern's Private Parts
>==========================

>Although Howard Stern's privacy (is this an oxymoron?) isn't in question
>here, your privacy is.
>
>The bill basically allows the telephone companies to use the data they have
>on you in any way they see fit, with one caveat: They must provide the same
>access to that information to competitors, if asked. As long as they don't
>hog all your private data, such as how many times
>you call Domino's Pizza or whether you're an avid QVC network shopper, they
>can sell your data to just about anyone and use it internal in ways that
>should make your skin crawl.
>
>This is all laid out in admittedly banal Congress speak: "A local exchange
>carrier (that's your local phone company) may use, disclose, or permit
>access to aggregate customer information... only if it provides such
>aggregate information to other carriers or persons on reasonable and
>nondiscriminatory terms and conditions up reasonable request therefore."
>
>In other words, bend over and kiss your sweet aggregate good-bye.
