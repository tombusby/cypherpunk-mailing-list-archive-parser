Interestingly, we wrote almost identical responses to Dmitri, although 
admittedly you won the "time race."

Is it:

Video tapes, yes.  Audio cassette tapes, maybe.

However, they should still be useful for floppies, for two reasons:

1.  Distance to the media is far smaller than to the average distance to the 
inside of a videotape cartridge.  (floppy cases are thinner.)

2.  The volume of material to be erased is FAR smaller than a typical 
videotape cartridge.  The middle of the tape of a 1/2" wide videotape spool is 
self-shielded by at least 1/4" of videotape; a 3.5" floppy disk is shielded 
only by distance.  (actually, the sliding doo-hickey over 3.5" floppies 
probably acts as a shield, too.
