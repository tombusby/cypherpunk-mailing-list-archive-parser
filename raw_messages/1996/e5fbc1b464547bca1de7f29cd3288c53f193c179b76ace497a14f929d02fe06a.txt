Not so easy - as somebody pointed out in another thread, this will be 
very easy to brute - only 2^24 cleartexts to try...

You have to put in some salt to prevent this.

If you want the recipient to be able to check that the key is correctly
there, you need to make the salt known to both (eg a 1-way hash of the 
whole key). You might want to do this to make the program refuse
to interoperate with hacked versions.

I suppose it'll be safe for a while yet (esp. for session keys), but
has anyone multiplied that graphics-workstation-40bit price by 2^24?
It's only 10 billion! (billion=10^9) A lot of money, sure, but given
that it's not very expensive to go to 128 bits or more, why ???

(Please, do NOT post c*nspiracy theories --- they are obvious to everyone
and therefore unpatentable.)

Now how about the percentage of *foreign* people who trust the US govt.?
Given that it has said that it'll spy commercially... (if memory serves).


Hope I'm making sense... (well, they say "hope dies last"...)
