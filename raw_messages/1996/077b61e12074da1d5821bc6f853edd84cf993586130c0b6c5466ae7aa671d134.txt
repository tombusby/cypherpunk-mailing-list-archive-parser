An interesting approach; given enough spare computing, the passphrase
is the key.  Remember to transform the passphrase space into some
wide-enough space that it will include a bunch of primes, to avoid
having multiple passphrases generating the same prime.  Primes density
is approximately log n (ln n?), e.g. 1/512 for a 512-bit number,
so a crude approach like using a 128-bit hash as the most significant bits
should do fine.

Almost by definition, you want at least 128 bits, since you'll probably be
using the public key crypto to protect a 128-bit session key.  (Keys for
signatures may need a bit less slack, though I'd still be wary of <90 bits.)
Also, if you're starting by taking an MD5 of the passphrase (after looking up
the words in the dictionary or whatever), you're limited to 128 bits of
entropy; it's probably worth using SHA, or at least picking p from the MD5
and q from the MD5 of the reverse of the passphrase.
