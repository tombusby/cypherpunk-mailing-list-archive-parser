I will of course defer to Will's grasp of the facts, since I haven't been
following this story or interviewing the principals. (Though I have read
the court's opinion and Reid's article in the Philly Inquirer.)

The judge did mention "status quo" in his opinion. I would hope that 
"status quo" would mean the ability of ISPs to offer and enforce whatever 
contracts they want -- including banning incoming spam -- without the 
intervention of the government. Unless, of course, the ISP breaks the 
contract, but in that case the plaintiffs should be the customers, not 
the spammer.

Contrary to what CyberPromo has been telling the press, Internet email is
not the U.S. Postal Service. In fact, the USPS has a rather horrific
monopoly that has given rise to Comstockery in the last century, the
Robert Thomas case more recently, laws giving the USPS the sole right to
insert mail in your mailbox, and las banning private enterprise from
delivering "non-urgent" mail.

That kind of bureaucratic monopolistic foolishness is not what the Net needs.
