No, this is not the case. Suppose your file of 64 million bits of entropy
is stored as "Rick's Geiger Counter File," perhaps on your Web site. (Great
for use by various people as a "virtual one time pad" (patent pending).)

A year or so from now someone asks a program to measure the entropy of this
file. Nearly all programs will report that the file has lots of bits of
entropy...

However, is this the "true" entropy? A clever program, or a person, might
well remember that this file is Rick's Geiger Counter File, making the bits
_very_ predictable (or, equivalently, little "surprise," low entropy, great
compressibility, etc.).

Once again, one can never know for sure that a file, sequence, string is
maximally compressed.

The application to your stated problem is that the two files might very
well have similar statistics (a good cryptographic hash function is likely
to produce a regular output, for example) and that a program cannot tell
which one is the "really random" file and which is the "seemingly random"
file is not a failing of the program, necessarily, but is implicit in some
inevitable limitations of all programs.
