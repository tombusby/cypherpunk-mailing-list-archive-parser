But it's more than breaking an agreement. If you voluntarily escrow 
your key (as with a corporation) and the holder is bribed to give it 
to a competitor, it may be more worth the holder's while to break a 
contract for the dollars the competitor may bribe him with.  It makes 
sense to have some criminal punishments for that.

Yes. In all areas of gov't. I'm all for the death penalty for 
prosecutors who push for the d.p. on people they know are innocent, 
for instance.  It'll never happen (at least not in our lifetimes), 
but it makes plenty of sense to me.

Internet to Ham links, though?  There's some technical drive there. 
It's just plateaued.

Who did UPS donate campaign funds to?

An interesting internet analogy can be drawn here...
