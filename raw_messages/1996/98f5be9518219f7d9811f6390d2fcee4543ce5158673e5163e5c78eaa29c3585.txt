I assume from the last sentence that you know that the use of strong 
primes is no longer advantageous but I will just reiterate it here 
for the good of those writing code which implements strong primes:

Strong primes are no longer of any benefit for cryptographic 
applications.

The elliptic curve method of factoring takes no longer to factor a 
"strong" prime than it does for any other general number.
You may *SLIGHTLY* hinder progress if an attacker sieves first, but 
as you should have done so when you created the primes in the first 
place it won`t be a problem because there wont be any small factors.

Implementing strong primes won`t make your code any less secure, it 
will just take longer to create the keys and won`t gain you any 
security, all te big boys are using elliptic curve factoring methods 
now so you really have nothing to gain.
