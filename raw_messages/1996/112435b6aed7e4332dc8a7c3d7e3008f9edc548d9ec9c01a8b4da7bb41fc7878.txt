I don't have a problem with companies escrowing keys or using a 
function like that described for Viacrypt's for official company 
business.  

Employees should be made fully aware, however, that their 
communications are being copied to a company archive.  There should 
be no illusion about the privacy of company communications using 
company-owned software.

For private communications, they should still use a personal copy of 
PGP or other encryption software of their choice.
