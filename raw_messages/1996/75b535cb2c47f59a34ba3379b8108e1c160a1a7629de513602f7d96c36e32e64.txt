Amazing, isn't it?  Or maybe I shoulda said "ain't".  Ja' ever see the
movie Joe Versus The Volcano? The perfect movie, IMO, although c-punks
might not like that sort of thing.

Anyway, the girl is telling Tom Hanks on the boat "My dad says most people
go around all day in a fog (quote approximate), but the ones who are awake
are in a constant state of amazement".  Stick around.  When you get off
of the roller coaster, it's all over.
