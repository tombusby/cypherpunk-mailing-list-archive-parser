Again, what I said was my lawyer called and said it was illegal to sell
fake passports in Anguilla.  The fraud was taxbomber saying he never sold
fake passports in his post to the net of "feel sorry for me my ISP made me
relocate even though I never sold fake passports".

My lawyer, probably the top lawyer in the country, said it is illegal in
Anguilla. I don't have a copy of that law.

Not clear if it is defined as fraud by the law.

This is part of it.  If nobody knew where he was things might have
continued as they were.  I mention it as a lesson learned.

We did not have any contract.  I have since posted a page with the policy. 
Fair point.

Well, multi-level marketing does not need to be pyramid scheme, but 
you are right that it could be bad news.  So I have taken off that
encouragement from my web page.  Thanks.
