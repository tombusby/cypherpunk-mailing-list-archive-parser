Could you characterize the failure modes?  I see 2 main ones:

    Confirmation notices directed to another address invisible to the
    successfully infiltrated attacker.

    Failure to initially infiltrate:

        Infiltration attempt failed.

        Potential victim never contacts infection vector.

I'm curious how you'd estimate the breakdown over these modes, and if
you see additional failure modes I've missed.
