Possibly, when looked on in a narrow venue. Polymorphic viruses exhibit 
this as only one characteristic though. It would be a tough sell in my 
book. Unless the patent's author stipulates in his method that this issue 
is the basis for the claim and that his claim is unique because of this 
method - then it just one step of many from point A to B.

As a hunch, I would suspect that Vault Corp. may have existing code that 
might qualify as prior art. Dave Lawrence and a few of his coding buddies 
spent several years staying one step ahead of software products like 
copyright, and it is concievable that some of this methodology may have 
been employed to do so.
