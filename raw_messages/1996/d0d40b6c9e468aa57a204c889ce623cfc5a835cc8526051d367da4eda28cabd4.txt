It's this last sig-quote that bothers me. It's worth noting that, unlike
the other two, it has no attribution. It looks like an inversion of 
Benjamin Franklin's: 

" They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety 
  deserve neither liberty nor safety." 
         - Historical Review of Pennsylvania

People usually put in their .sigs quotes they feel sum up their personal
philiosophy. I guess soon we'll see 'Gabriel' give us some more words
to live by; these may be right up his alley:

"War is Peace"
"Ignorance is Strength"
"Freedom is Slavery"
	- Orwell, "1984"

Gabriel's also misquoting Burke - the actual text is:
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing. "
