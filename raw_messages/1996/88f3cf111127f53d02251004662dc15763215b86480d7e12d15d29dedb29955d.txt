Wrong. Society has long made a distinction between liberty and license, and
"freedom" is a definitional and even societal-situational thing that keeps
advancing. Check out history. Read some Supreme Court decisions of the more
thoughtful kind.

It IS relevant in the underlying principles it illustrates. That the
details aren't of the same magnitude is irrelevant. Didn't you learn
"reductio ad absurdum" in school?

It is ludicrous for some cypherpunks to try to compare their "cause" with
freeing the slaves or overthrowing a tyrannical and abusive dictator. In
fact it is romantic fantasy. Not every prosecution is of Jean Valjean; not
every arrest for speeding is the destruction of freedom as we know it. Not
every theoretical consequence is a current abuse. "Trust everyone, but
always cut the cards" is a better guide for living in a democratic society
than "distrust everyone and insist on all or nothing".

Essentially, one who opposes or deliberately sabotages Netscape's
compromise with full ITAR deregulation is a fascist in that he is trying to
force his will on those of his fellow citizens who want to download the
secure US version in the US, and deny _them_ _their_ rights.
