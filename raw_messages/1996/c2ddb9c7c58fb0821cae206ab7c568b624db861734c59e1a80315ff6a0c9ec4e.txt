Subject: Please criticize PGP-based robomoderator

Hello,

Today UVV's announced that a new group, soc.culture.russian.moderated,
was voted into existence. If all goes well, it should be newgrouped
soon. 

For this group, I wrote a robomoderator program that does the following: 

	1) Enforces posting style required by the charter
	2) Checks PGP signatures on incoming messages and prevents some
	   types of forgeries
	3) Implement secure (PGP-based) exchange between robomoderator
	   program and human moderators, for messages requiring their
	   approval
	4) Black lists, white lists, and lists of suspicious words 
	   (Cypherpunks may imagine that ``medusa'' would be a suspicious
	   word for this list)
	5) Signs (with Greg Rose's PMApp) approved articles to prevent
	   posting articles with forged approval
	6) supports appeals, moderators' mailing list, and more.

A specification for the robomoderator is on my home page at 

      http://www.algebra.com/~ichudov/usenet/scrm/robomod/robomod.html

and your criticisms and suggestions are more than welcome.

For security reasons, we cannot post the code yet. We'll do it after 
I systematically proofread it to make sure that it is secure.

Robomoderator is written in perl and sh, with some C code. It is working,
but there are sopme minor things to do (they are listed in the TODO list
on my WWW Page).

Thanks to Dr. Dimitri Vulis for several good suggestions that I implemented.

	- Igor.
