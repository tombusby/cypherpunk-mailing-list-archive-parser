Several points:

* The Supreme Court formally decided many years ago that leaflets, fliers,
articles, handouts, etc., cannot be required to be identified. (Some state
had tried to require that leaflets be identifed with the name of the author
or distributing group. I don't have the case name handy, but it's pretty
famous and is cited in all the books on cyberspace law...I may even have a
mention of it by name in the Cyphernomicon.)

* This ruling, which is certainly fully consistent with the First
Amendment, should of course apply to electronic forms of leaflets, fliers,
articles, handouts, etc. Unless, of course, there is an upheld
interpretation that the Net is different from print media, which I think it
clearly is not.

* As to laws against receiving a letter and then resending it to somone
else...how could that be a crime? What I receive in my mail is my business.
What I do with what I receive in the mail is also my business. Demanding
that I process letters or notes to me in certain ways and not in other ways
would be interfering with my communications.

(Quibblers will likely cite FCC and election campaign laws as a
counterexample. Wrongly, I think. Another debate.)

* Now if I start doing this remailing on a large-scale basis, various
business regulations, tax laws, etc., obviously come into effect.
"Remailings Etc." will have to satisfy various regulators, tax collectors,
OSHA inspectors, etc...all the things that make it so hard to start a small
business in America. However, I can't think of any obvious laws which ban
receiving a package or letter, removing the outer addressing, removing the
payment, and then resending it.

(Not saying there aren't such regulations, though I think they are clearly
unconstitutional. The "regulate commerce" language which is frequently
cited as justification for meddling in business should not be able to turn
a business into a lawbreaker for doing what individuals can do.)


In summary, what I receive in my mail, physical or electronic, is for me to
do with as I wish. This includes sending it on to another site, commenting
on it (*), etc.

(* A finesse I thought of a few years ago is this: If remailing is ever
banned or if remailers are held liable, use _quotes_. That is, I say:

Somebody sent me this:

<message>

----

Now, what's a law against remailers going to do? Hold me liable for passing
a message on and asking for comment?

(Yes, I think this is a pretty transparently cute ploy to circumvent laws
about remailings. But it shows, I think, the can of worms that gets opened
should such a law ever get passed and then upheld. It would place limits
not only on what one could "remail without comment," but on what one could
_include_ in one's own messages!)
