I understand that you don't want to nit-pick *every* bit of every post,
however, once you do decide to pick on somebody, surely you could point
to the specific fallacies, rather than wring your hands and gnash your
teeth as you did in the long note to the Great Expelled One.

Don't think I don't know what's going on here. I got permanently expelled
from two schools as a youth, to name just two examples from my illustrious
career, yet after learning how to play the game, I probably am doing much
better than most of the drones who completed their studies and kept their
mouths shut.  My life is continually interesting, and I wouldn't think of
trading it for the neurotic, control-freak-mentality lifestyle certain
folks around here "enjoy".

I'm sure (if you know crypto topics) you realize that in creating a crypto
solution, there's no substitute for rigorous attention to detail.  I'm not
opposed to paying some attention to decorum, but logic comes first,
otherwise, you won't have a leg to stand on.
