There are times when you want multiple keys with the same ID.  I have two
key sizes becuase one is an older key.  I keep it around for use with people
who are using versions that do not support the larger keys.  (I have run
into this once from a sometimes user of PGP.  He finally upgraded.)  To
aleviate the suspicion, I have the two keys sign each other.

Only if you use the name to refer to the key and not the hex ID.  (I found
out the hard way that some front ends use either the last key created or
whatever they feel like for signing keys and/or signing messages.  I am
still trying to straighten out some of the weird results of that.)
Fortunatly, some programs will use the hex ID to refer to the key so there
is no confusion.

Revocations are supported, but they require the passphrase.  (I have a
number of revokations on my keyring from various folks.)  The problem here
is occasions where you have forgotten the passphrase.  (I have an old
keyring that I need to go and revoke all of the old keys on it.  I have not
used them in a year or two.  I doubt if they are even on the keyserver...)
Eventually there will be a way of revoking keys in the circumstance.
Something similar to a notary (or a combination of notaries) who can vouch
and say "hey, this guy really did lose his keys".
