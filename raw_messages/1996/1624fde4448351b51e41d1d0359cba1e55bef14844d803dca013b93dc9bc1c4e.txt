When I run lynx (2.3.7 beta) to <URL:
http://www.anonymizer.com/cgi-bin/snoop.pl >, it says:

   Here's a sampling of the kind of information that a site can collect
   on you (please wait a moment):
 
 
     Your computer is a Unix box.
     Your Internet browser is Lynx.
     You are coming from jobe.shell.portal.com.
     You just visited the Anonymizer Home Page.

No user name here.

Also, when I follow a mailto: link it asks me to input the email address
I want the mail to be from!  So I don't think it is using local user name
information, although certainly that is potentially available to it.
