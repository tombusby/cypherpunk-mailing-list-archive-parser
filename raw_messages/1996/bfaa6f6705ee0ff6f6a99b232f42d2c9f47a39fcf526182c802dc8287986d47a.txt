>     The George Washington University Department of Electrical

>offers a traditional graduate program with a few twists.  One of the
>twists is that we now have four
>graduate courses related to computer security, and an area of
>specialization (within computer science) in
>it.  In addition, the opportunities to pursue dissertation work and
>special projects are "real world" since
>many government administrative agencies, laboratories, and Congress
>are usually just a metro ride away.
