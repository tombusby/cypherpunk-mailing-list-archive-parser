It's in AC II, p.319 (I was getting worried for a minute, I missed it the first
time I looked and then couldn't figure out where I'd got the info from).

It's mentioned in the list of minor RC4 weaknesses.  I didn't include refs for
all of these because I've already probably got as many references in there as
text (the term "reference terrorism" has been used to describe some of my
papers in the past).

Interesting... does anyone want to comment on this?  This kind of damages one
of my assumptions in the paper that publicity attacks can hurt a company
providing poor security.  Could it be that at the time people would buy
Netscape stock no matter what happened?  If MSIE had been widespread at the
time, would it have caused people to jump ship en masse?

It's a pretty obscure attack and one which most implementations (ones running
on home PC's) won't ever need to worry about, given that it's many times easier
to get a victim to download some whiz-bang ActiveX applet which quietly patches
their browser to use a fixed key for all SSL sessions.  Has anyone thought of
doing this?  If I had a system (and compiler) capable of building ActiveX
apps I'd love to do this - create an espionage-enabling screen saver or 
something.
