Except when I had Rifkin on the phone on a National Commie Radio talk show
he dishonestly refused to admit the fact that -- so far -- employment in the
US (total and percentage workforce participation) is higher than it's ever been.

A lot of that is the commie belief that a job is something someone else
gives you rather than something that you do.  It's a bit hard to be without
work if you assign it to yourself.  And if wants are unlimited then one of
the "goods" for which wants are unlimited is labor.
