Has an interesting story by by Peter Cary, Douglas Pasternak and Penny Loeb, 
about big mother's great care in disposing of munitions; including, but not 
at all limited to, encryption. For sale are attack helicopter partss, bombs, 
missiles, guidance systems, howitzer parts, computers, and yes, military 
cryptosystems.

While by law all these things are supposed to be demilitarized, they aren't 
in many cases. They are instead evidently sold as scrap (and at scrap 
prices) and go to nice countries like China. If it were closer to April 1st, 
I would doubt this story is real. <sigh>

According to the assistant U.S. attorney in Sacramento, "The scope of this 
program and the amount of materiel going out the door is so huge, people 
normally don't believe you. Only the government could have a program where 
they give everything away for free and they screw it up."

Couldn't have said it better myself...

One of the "legitimate concerns of law enforcement" seems to be
that I was born innocent until proven guilty and not the other
way around. -- me
