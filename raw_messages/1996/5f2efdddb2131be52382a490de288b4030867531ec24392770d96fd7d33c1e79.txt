IMO, it's simpler than that:  suppose your favorite rater (SafeForChildren, 
SafeForCongressCritters, SafeFor<our>Church, ...) has a PGP-style key.  If they 
rate a page as OK for their subscribers to read, the rater signs the page with 
it's private key and requests the page owner to include that signature on the 
page.  If you want to limit what you read to what they approve, you read only 
those pages whose signatures can be verified with the trusted rater's public 
key.  BTW, you could put the signature verification into the WEB browser rather 
than the proxy and keep the overhead out in the user's PC.

Would need extensions to HTML standards; e. g. <rated_by xxxyyyzzz = 
0123456789abcdef_hash>.  This would be the hash over the entire page _excluding_
the "rated_by portion(s) so that multiple raters could exist and interoperate.

Just my own opinion.

I agree, if you're going to bother with rating pages, digitally signing the 
signature so that terrorist X can't just copy the "Good Clean Fun" rating 
code into his Phosgene formula page is the only rational solution.
     
Gotta love that overhead, though.
