Not an unusual thing online (Windows! Mac! Windows! Mac! Linux!).

I swer I had this conversation somewhere recently, and those of us involved
in it came up with one reason this rift seems to come up so often and get
discussed so publically, especially in comparison to our "organized,
determined" opponents. I would hazard a guess that those people working
within the cause of electronic freedoms tend not to be the simple
order-following, authority-heeding sort (compared to, say, followers of the
Religious Right). It's easy if you're Ralph Reed to send out a flyer or get
the telemarketters working and tell the troops what to do. It's not as easy
if you're, say, Jonah Seiger. Not because of Jonah (or Shabbir, or Declan,
or whoever), but because of his audience. It's not a push-button response
with us.

And I'm still not convinced (as I wasn't last year when I was more heavily
involved in some of this) that these differences of opinion have to somehow
be kept behind-closed-doors. That has always stuck me as the way -they- do
it (if I can stoop to using a Them for a moment), and never as a way that
was inherently required.

It's like the Gulf War or something. "Hey, we're at war, stop criticising,
we need to be united!" Hogwash.
