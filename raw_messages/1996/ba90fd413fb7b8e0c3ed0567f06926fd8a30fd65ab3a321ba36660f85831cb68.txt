To do that they would need to crack one or more of the accounts with
access to the alpha server, which would probably leave evidence, or run a
packet sniffer nearby. Ironically, I am more confident of the security of
alpha.c2.org than I am of my own machine. The threat profile is people who
have forwarded mail with envelope and Received: headers indicating that
the source is my mail spool to a mailing list. Twice. I know that I'm
surrounded by insecure, non-firewalled UNIX boxes that could be running
packet sniffers, and that is something I cannot fix unless I want to trade
gloriously fast and reliable Ethernet connectivity for a modem. My
correspondents do not have PGP and are not likely to get it. So, a public
alpha nym helps in this (perhaps unique) case.

rich@alpha.c2.org also works as a permanent address (knock on wood).
