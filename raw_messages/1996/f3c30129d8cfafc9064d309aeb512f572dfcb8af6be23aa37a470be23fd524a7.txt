Unfortunately RTP is not a crypto protocol, and does not have a 
standardized encrypted form.  

Therefore any encrypted protocol is necessarily proprietary and
non standard, unless Phill Zimmerman has published a standard.

If Netscape creates a standard for encrypting RTP, and publishes it,
that will be a move towards a standard, not a move away from a standard.

One mechanism for encrypting RTP would be to construct a shared secret
key by DH exchange, or Rabin if one wished to dodge patents, construct
a cryptographically strong pseudo random data stream from the key, using
Ron's code, and for each RTP packet, encrypt using a block from that 
data stream as the packet key.
