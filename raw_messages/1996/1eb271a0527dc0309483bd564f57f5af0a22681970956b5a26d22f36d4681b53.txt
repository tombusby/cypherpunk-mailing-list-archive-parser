     AN OPEN INVITATION TO THE INTERNET COMMUNITY FROM MEMBERS OF
     THE SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE
     
     July 23, 1996
     
     This week, the Senate Commerce Committee will take a historic step

     on S. 1726, the "Pro-CODE" Act of 1996 will be cybercast live on the 
     Internet.
     
     As many of you are well aware, the debate over US encryption policy is 
     of vital importance to the future development of the Internet and the 
     privacy of all Americans.   We are writing to invite you to join us in
