If the only means of detection is raiding homes to inspect them for
contraband--something not even done during the height of the anti-drug
hysteria, at least not on a regular basis--then I stand by my comment that
stopping private use of cryptography requires a police state such as the
world has not yet seen.

Oh? How? If the output of such a program looks like quantization or Johnson
noise in a recording, then how could this form of "speech" be effectively
isolated?

Careful! Some of your examples are not examples of _prohibited_ speech, but
are instead examples of _actionable_ speech. The Constitution is fairly
clear that the government cannot be a filter or censor for speech.

Hence, requirements that people speak in English, or in some other language
that the government can understand, is not required. Not even in a criminal
case, as a matter of fact. (If I speak only Skansko-Bravatlian, and am the
only such speaker in the world, I cannot be compelled to study English or
even Spanish prior to a trial.)

Requiring people to speak or write in a language that is understandable to
some GS-10 at Fort Meade would appear to violate the First Amendment in a
rather serious way. As encrypted speech is really just another language
(tell me I'm wrong on this, anyone), encrypted speech appears to be fully
protected by the First Amendment, which says that Congress shall make no
law about speech, blah blah.

I strongly disagree. Prosecution would involve making certain _forms_ of
speech illegal (not the same thing as the _content_ being illegal, as in
ordering the kililng of another, or treason, or shouting "Fire!"
improperly). And detection and collection of evidence would almost
certainly involve illegal searches and seizures.

Not ipso facto, but having people serving life sentences for speaking in an
outlawed language certainly meets my definition of a police state.
