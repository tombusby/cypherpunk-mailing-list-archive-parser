The sound quality really isn't there, unless you have a fast machine or a
fat pipe. In addition, the vast majority of Intel based computers lack the
crucial (for user acceptance) full-duplex soundcard. Add to that the
physical impossibility of getting decent real time services over a
non-isochronous network, such as the Internet, I'net phones just don't
provide suffcient speech quality for business/serious personal use even
without the added overhead of crypto.
