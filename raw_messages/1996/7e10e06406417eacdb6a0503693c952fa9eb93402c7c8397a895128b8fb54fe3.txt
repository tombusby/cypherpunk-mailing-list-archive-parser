Agreed.  Writing good crypto is certainly praiseworthy and desirable, but it 
does not "fight ITAR," per se.  (It fights lack of crypto, which is not the 
same thing!  Lack of crypto certainly needs to be fought, as well.)

Writing the software and selling it domestically is, at best, 
"ITAR-neutral."   Putting it on the net in the most unrestrictive way the 
State Department has previously approved of is also "ITAR-neutral."  
(Because such a method is, presumably, within the rights of anyone; we can 
conclude this because "the State Department said so.")

A _PRO_-ITAR stance is one in which a company or person puts restrictions on 
his distribution of that software above and beyond what have historically 
been approved, particularly when prior distributions of software are still 
going on with those previously-approved restrictions. They may be absolutely 
entitled to do so, but that's still pro-ITAR.  For a small and uninfluential 
company, the significance of doing that is minor, but for Netscape, it's 
crucial because it practically invites the government to set a new precedent 
beyond what they (the government) previously thought they might get away with.

Yes, if we really oppose ITAR, we should kill it by insisting that the 
government fully document it at every turn.
