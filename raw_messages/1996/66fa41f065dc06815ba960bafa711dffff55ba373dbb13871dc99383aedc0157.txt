I don't think anyone has argued that the owner of the list doesn't have the
right to remove people from it.  However, simply because he has the right to
doesn't mean he should, and it also doesn't mean other members can't or
shouldn't argue that he made a bad decision (unless, of course, the dissenting
members are removed as well.)  Many, if not most, members believe the list
should be run in a non-authoritarian manner (whoever argued that the term
authoritarian applies only to governments is wrong.  the difference is a person
has the right to act in an authoritarian manner over his own property whereas
a government doesn't have that right over it's citizens.  Again, however,
having 
the right doesn't necessarily make it "okay").
