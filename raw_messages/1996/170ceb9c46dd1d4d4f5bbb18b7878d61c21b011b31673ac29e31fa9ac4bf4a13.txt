Having recently been involved in a similar situation :-), I found that
the following trick seems to work:  have someone you know start a consulting
company in another country (like Canada (yes, Canada is another country)).
It seems an F-1 student (like me (for now; I'm trying to switch to J-1))
is allowed to work for a foreign company (as if the US government could prevent
a foreign company from hiring a foreign citizen (well, it could try...
(these nested parens are getting out of hand...))).  So just contract work
out to a foreign consulting company, which subcontracts work out to
the F-1 student.
