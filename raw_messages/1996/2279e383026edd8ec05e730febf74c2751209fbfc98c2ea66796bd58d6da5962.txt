>        This is an extremely important proceeding for anyone doing business
>online.  If the RBOCs get their way, the cost of connecting to the Net
>could go through the roof.  Pepper & Corazzini is preparing to file
>comments and reply comments on behalf of interested parties. This will
>be a very time-consuming effort as we anticipate voluminous comments to
>be filed by a large number of companies.  We are prepared to file joint
>comments and replies on behalf of companies supporting the present
>policy of exempting ISPs from access charges.  This will enable a large
>number of firms to participate at a nominal cost.  Please contact me if
>you are interested.  And please feel free to circulate this to any list
>that may be relevant.
