 >>I heard that CitiBank has filed for a patent in Japan with 140+ claims

The document is on my desk:

  CitiBank's patent in Japan #: Toku-Kou-Hei 7-111723
    o 104 claims
    o published date: 29 Nov, 1995
    o 112 pages (text: 48 pages, fig.: 64 pages.)

# Note:
# "Toku" means "Tokkyo", "tokkyo" == "patent"
# "Kou" means "Koukoku", "koukoku" == "published"
# "Hei" means "Heisei", "Heisei" is the Japanese year-
#   name; This year == Heisei 8 == 1996.

A publication of the CitiBank's patent was a big news in
industrial or financial domain in Japan.  I found the
article on Nikkei-Sangyo shinbun.

# sangyo == industrial
# shinbun == paper

Probably yes.

It seems that "Toku-Kou-Hei 7-111723" claims specified
procedure, not *general* "methods of doing business".

I think that Japanese P.O. has changed their policy in a
few years influenced with U.S.P.O.
