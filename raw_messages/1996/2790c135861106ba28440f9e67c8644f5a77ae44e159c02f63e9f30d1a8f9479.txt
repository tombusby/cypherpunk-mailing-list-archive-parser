i also have never heard of an attempt on Hitler's life by anyone other that the
germans. the us did, however, assassinate Yamamoto Isoroku, and did a very neat
job of it at that.

i once read a sci-fi story about time travelers going back to kill Hitler,
and the disaster that occured when someone succeeded and Hitler's place was 
taken by someone even more onerous.  in the story there was a group of people
whose job it was to prevent this assassination, since so many people in the 
future had that idea that doing away with Hitler was a good thing to do there
was practically a queue of would-be assassins.
