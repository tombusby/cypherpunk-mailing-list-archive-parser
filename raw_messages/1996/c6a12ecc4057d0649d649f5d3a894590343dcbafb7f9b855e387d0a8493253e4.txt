Some bothersome things about this editorial...

IMO, the US does not have a comfortable lead. It's already falling 
behind considering some of the stronger crypto programs available (at 
least as freeware) are made outside the US.  Many of the stronger 
algorithms were invented outside of the US (IDEA for instance).

So why should criminals bother with using standards if they are 
readable by authorities?

Are they going to magically erase all copies of strong software that 
is already currently available? (Side note: the Pacifica news report 
on Friday notes that while Freeh gave his testimony, over 100 copies 
of PGP were downloaded from MIT's site.)

And evidence cannot be encrypted.  You cannot encrypt an airplane 
full of cocaine or an unusually expensive car baught by money from 
drugs, espionage, etc.  Nor can you encrypt bomb-making materials, 
nor conversations in a room (from your mouth to a telephone 
receiver).  Nor will encryption do anything about informants inside 
the communications loop. etc. etc....

It's not clear that terrorism can be tracked, even if it's unencrypted.
The OK and WTC bombings were apparently not encrypted, and there's 
some allegations that the authorities had advanced warnings of the 
latter.

The controls haven't done much to prevent free software from being 
exported.  They only control commercial sales of software (and 
hardware).

Particularly absent in the WaPo-ed is that many do not trust the 
authorities (in the US and elsewhere)--particularly the FBI, which
has a long history of extra-legal surveillance.
