Yes.

No, and for obvious reasons.

If the guy is worried because he is paranoid, then that is his reality. 
It's not as difficult as you might think to find someone if you really 
want to - with or without fingerprints.

If he is paranoid because he has baggage, then that is also his problem. 
We live by our own choices everyday - both good and bad. There are some 
consequences that take time to catch up with us, and some of those are 
unavoidable.

If the job is worth it to him, then he will submit - otherwise there are 
lots of other places to work that don't require printing.
