You're thinking like a statist.  If Saddam's death leaves "a power vacuum," 
then simply kill the leadership of Iran, and any other nearby state with 
designs on the middle east.  Gee, whats the problem?  This "kill the 
leadership" system gets mighty addictive!  Where will it end? 

Which is why it isn't started in the first place.  The people who might 
start it are the ones with the most to lose if it spreads.  That's why 
Saddam is alive today.
