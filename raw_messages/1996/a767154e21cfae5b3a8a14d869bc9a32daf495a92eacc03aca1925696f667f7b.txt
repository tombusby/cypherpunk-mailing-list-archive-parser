Just an FYI, Consensus Development (not Consensys) can only offer a
commercial licenses to RSAREF. Some such licenses we can grant waivers to
user lower-level routines -- to date we've granted waivers for SSL and PGP
compatible software.

The problem is that only RSA Labs (not RSA Data Security) can offer this
permission (as they have all the non-commercial rights) and they are not
set up to handle such requests.

I'll see what I can do as the commercial licensee to influence making this
happen. RSAREF was released "to support standards" and SSH is a beginning
of a standard, so I think it should be possible.
