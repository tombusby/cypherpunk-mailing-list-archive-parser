Agreed, and this is happening (slowly). Some have said that "cypherpunks
spread crypto" is a better motto than just "cypherpunks write code," for
this reason and because it covers broader ground, although coding will
always be essential to any of the other cypherpunk efforts in the end.
Theres a lot of talent on this list, despite a few nuts mixed in.

Distasteful, but probably true.
