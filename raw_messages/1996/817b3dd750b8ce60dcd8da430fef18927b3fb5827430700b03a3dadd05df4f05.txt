As an amusing aside, the text that Alan Olsen deleted was the quote from
our least favorite cripple. My response only started here:

I was also responding to this article by Dan Hartung, a Usenet votetaker:

As you see, I find Dan Hartung's homophobic ravings even more distasteful
than the whining cripple's censorous demands that cypherpunk technology not
be used to promote homophobia, as in the abive example. I actually defended
the cripple from Dan Hartung in the above quote.

As for AIDS, I remind you that some people with AIDS or HIV lie about their
condition on purpose, in order to infect others. A very angry demented cripple
would fit this pattern.

> As for him "dragging outside articles into this group"...  You must mean him

Alan Olsen is lying again, as usual. The cripple has on numerous occasions
forwarded entire large Usenet articles to the cypherpunks mailing list whose
only relevance was a mention of my name in some derogatary way. He's been
trying to drag his little Usenet flame wars to this mailing list for months;
finally he succeeded.

> Another thing that you need to do is learn how to comprehend written english.

That's a pretty racist remark.

> who have met him who have not gotten along with him.

Are you talking about the same demented cripple who tried to organize a
"cypherpunks" meeting at his place and specifically excluded certain people
because he didn't like their political views?
