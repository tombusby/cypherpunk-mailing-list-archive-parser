Well, this is not what the proposals for GAK involve. If it were _only_ a
matter of each country requiring GAK for communicatons entering its
country, then this would be as you describe (not that many of us would
approve of it).

What complicates matters is that the U.S. proposes that _it_ keep
records/escrows of communications with, say, recipients in Libya. Or
Russia, or Burma, or Tazbekinoya. This means automatically that simplistic
models ("encrypt to the public key of Tazbekinoya" will not be sufficient).

No, I think you are missing the point. The issue about Libya is that the
GAK system must make decisions about when and under what conditions it
accedes to government wishes--for governments we may be hostile toward.

Or governments may be hostile toward us.

As I said in another message, I don't think there can be a unified GAK
policy. I believe the U.S. Administration hopes to browbeat enough nations
into compliance such that it--the U.S. government--controls which keys are
released and which are not. My point about "rogue" governments is that the
problems of Burma, Libya, etc. will not vanish. Clearly the U.S. government
will not settle for waiting for Libya or Burma to co-release keys....

And nothing in GAK says one gets to communicate with Libyan parties by
encrypting with the public key of Libya, thus bypassing the U.S. decryption
capabilities!
