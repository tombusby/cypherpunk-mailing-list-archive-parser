** ENCRYPTION TOOL NOW NEWTON 2.0 SAVVY **

Geert Jadoul <76271.2121@CompuServe.COM> reports that he has finally
finished a Newton 2.0 savvy version of NDcrypt.

NDcrypt 2.0 Light is an improved version of NDcrypt v1.6.  It has become
a US$15 shareware utility with a trial period of 4 weeks.  After 4 weeks the
"Encrypt" and "UnReadable" buttons will disappear until you fill in the
registration code in the preferences window.  You will still be able
after 4 weeks to "Decrypt" notes or make them "Readable" again, so you
will not lose any data.

The name "NDcrypt 2.0 Light" also infers that Geert is working on a
NDcrypt 2.0 Pro version.  This version will have better incorporation of
NDcrypt in the system; overview and search functions; and viewing Notes
(decrypt a Note to view it but keep it encrypted in the Notes app).

NDcrypt 2.0 Light is available at <ftp://newton.uiowa.edu/submissions>
with the name "NDcry2Li.sit" and on Compuserve <GO NEWTON> under "NOS
2.0 ONLY".
