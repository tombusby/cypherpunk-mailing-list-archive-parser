My point. (Also a point made by Mark Neely, I just noticed, when he wrote a
couple of days ago: "Well, that puts legislation making virus authoring a
crime
into a new (and difficult) position.")

Again, my point. I was not saying such virus writing is currently against
U.S. laws, at least not at the national level (the fifty states and various
other local governments have their own laws, as the Georgia example about
remailers is only the latest example of).

I was referring to the general discussion reported here and in places like
"Risks" about illegalizing the generation of virus software. (A search of
the archives, when they come back up, will reveal debates here on this.)

(And I dimly recall at least one state legislature passing a law making
"virus software" ipso facto illegal, regardless of being used in a trespass
situation. The archives may produce more on this.)

I don't think such a law is Constitutional, which is my point. Judge Patel
seems to recognize this, as it relates to the Bernstein case.
