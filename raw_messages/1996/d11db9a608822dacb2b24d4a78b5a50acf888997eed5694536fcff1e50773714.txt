Not only that, what are all these college grads going to do?   Only a small
percentage are going to be making waves in a given field.   Many are just
going to lower the overall average...  Worse yet, many become lawyers <g>.  
A society with such a high percentage of parasites (those who don't add value
sufficient to cover expenses) isn't healthy.

Why are they going to college?  Well they weren't learning it in HS.  They
did however learn to feel good about themselves, use a condom and handle
complex social situations (see: gossip.  Or, for the average guy, see:
wedgie).
What use this serves is an excellent question.

That's putting it mildly. . .    I read 200+ pages/hour with a very high
retention rate.  Needless to say, this means I move through books at high
speed.   Quite a few times I've had the experience of summarizing a "Great
Work" to a college-educated teacher.    Almost scary.    Equally bad are the
people who read but do not understand.   The term functionally illiterate
comes to mind.   We may joke that people switch into "Idiot Mode" (Apologies
to the BOFH author) around computers but I've run into a number of people who
are apparently stuck in it.
