   "Anomalies across international borders"

   "I think there is a feeling that the UK's long history 
   of success in code-cracking makes the security services 
   confident about being able to break through any encryption
   scheme -- or use criminal law to enforce surrender of the
   key," Neil Barrett says. In his recent book, "The 
   State of the Cybernation", he examines cross-border
   encryption issues in greater detail.
