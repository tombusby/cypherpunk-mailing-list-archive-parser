I meant processor backup of course.  When my processor breaks at 2AM and I
need to get the report out by 8AM, I'm going to call the software support
line and get help.  Or the friendly hardware manufacturer is going to come
right out and certify my processor is dead.  Come on and get real.  With
most software vendors I can't even submit a bug report.

Note that I am not saying there is a technical problem here.  I do see big
problems with infrastructure and marketing.  The last time software
companies tried to market copy protection, it failed in the market place.
I predict that encyphered instruction streams will too, and for the same
reasons.
