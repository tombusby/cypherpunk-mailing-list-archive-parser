It seems to me that it would be possible to squeeze one bit of subliminal 
data into each tcp packet if you were willing to sacrifice a few cpu 
cycles in the process:
 
A tcp header contains quite a bit of useful information.. but most of it 
wouldnt be easily manipulated (by me) to get a bit. You cant very well 
alternate the port number you are using, or change the packet sequence 
numbers. However, the tcp protocol forces each tcp header to contain a 
'checksum' field.. which is (more or less) the sum of all the octets in 
the packet. This is used as error correction for the protocol. It 
shouldn't be too difficult to force TCP to fiddle with the data in the 
packet a bit to force the checksum to be a particular sort of thing (i.e. 
even or odd number) .. 0 for even and 1 for odd would get us our one 
bit of data per packet. 

I may be wrong, but im pretty certain that you could hack your client (an 
ftp client would be a good choice since it can easily be made to receive 
vast numbers of packets without attracting attention) and leave the basic 
tcp/ip stack untouched.  If your client figured out what sort of packet 
needed to be sent to get the right bit before passing it to the tcp stack 
then voila you have a subliminal channel.

Of course there are alot of other ways to go about it, im sure..
