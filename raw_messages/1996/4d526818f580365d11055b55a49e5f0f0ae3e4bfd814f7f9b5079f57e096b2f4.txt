Thanks Declan for forwarding your letter to me.  I'll answer some of the
points you refer to:

>So much for anonymous remailers! But the CyberAngels, in a fit of almost
> painful hypocrisy, use anonymous remailers themselves, as Charles Platt
>recounts in his book _Anarchy Online_:

Some of our members use anon remailers (although strictly speaking they are
pseudo anon remailers and therefore the user can be traced).  These are
members who are also supporters of privacy and anonymity online.  I do
myself use an anon remailer.  There is nothing hypocritical about it at
all.  We are not proposing to ban anon remailers, we are simply concerned
about the abuse of them.

This message was not from our organization at all.  Surely you have heard
of  impersonation?  The oldest trick in thebook.

Just goes to show what happens when people abuse anon remailers, right?
But it was not me.

LOL, Gabriel is my nickname!  I think the writer is thinking too hard about
conspiracies...

People also wish to evaluate the work of the Guardian Angels by asking how
many arrests we have made.  But this misses the point of the work entirely.
We do not patrol to make arrests.  We patrol to help others.  And a good
patrol means that nothing happens.

As for press, we didnt even send a press release until 4 months after we
started, and then only to announce our website.  And we've only sent one
more press release out since then.  We do believe however that we have
helped to bring the issue of children and the Internet to the forefront and
that is a good thing too.

The Safesurf system is a voluntary rating system that URLs undertake
themselves.  If you want to know more about the criteria you should check
out Safesurf themselves at http://www.safesurf.com

Why ask?  Clearly a site with a message like this would not be suitable for
children to read.  That would be an adult site rating.

Safesurf does not make software.  It's not a software manufacturer at all.

Declan I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but since you clearly are
hostile to our mission I see no reason why we should invite you to help us.

Of course you could always sign up as an anonymous volunteer from an anon
remailer , or from another account, and pretend to believe in what we are
doing ;)

CyberAngels is about self-regulation.  Let us not confuse the fight against
internet crime with the criminalization of free speech.  We propose the
former not the latter.
