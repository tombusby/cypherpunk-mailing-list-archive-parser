	There's also the point that some whistleblowing isn't exactly
what some political groups would want to occur. For instance, opponents
to unions such as myself aren't going to want a whistleblower to be able
conveniently to report their exclusion from a job due to union membership.

	Such a clearinghouse is what we call a fat target; something
likely to attract attention since wiretapping it could be very useful
to an organization that worried about having a whistleblower.

	As such, the correct attitude towords whistleblowing is to use
an anonymous remailer, and send to interested parties.  That's how the
AT&T deal that sunk the des phones and made clipper a household word
was publicized; a member of the list(?) interested party sent a
number of interesting documents through remailers to cypherpunks.
