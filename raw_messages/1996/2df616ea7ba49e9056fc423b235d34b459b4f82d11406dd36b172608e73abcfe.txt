Again, and as Tim is aware, this is not the true meaning of the fine
old word "escrow," which as we all know involves neutral, trusted
third parties. I think that this requires a new term, so I am now
proposing one: "GAR -- Government Access to Remailers." In real life,
the gar is a fish that lives in great numbers in the Everglades, just
west of where I type. They can grow to a very large size. The fossil
record indicates that this species has been around, unchanged, since
dinosaur times. Keeping the Pinnochio tale in mind, I find it quite
fitting that the gar has a *very* long nose in relation to its body.
;)

Indeed.
