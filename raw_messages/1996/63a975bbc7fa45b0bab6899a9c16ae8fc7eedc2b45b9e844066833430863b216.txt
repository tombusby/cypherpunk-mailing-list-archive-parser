  It is certainly possible to put e-mail 'into the loop' when
issuing certs via the web.  With Netscape Navigator 3.0 there is
no requirement that the cert be issued immediately when requested.
I expect that some cert vendors who are issuing low assurance
certs will e-mail the requestor a password that they can use to
retrieve their cert.  This at least provides some(not total) assurance
that the requestor can receive e-mail at the address in the cert.
