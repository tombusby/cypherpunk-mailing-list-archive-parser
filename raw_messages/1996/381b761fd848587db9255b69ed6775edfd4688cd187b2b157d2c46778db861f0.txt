Little CP relevance, except as re: a former (maybe current, but no longer
actively participating) list member, so I'll be brief.

Much work was done in the 70s on "worms," which are related to viruses.
John Shoch (spelling may be wrong) at Xerox PARC developed a "worm" which
propagated from machine to machine, circa 1974 (give or take a year).

John Brunner immortalized this in "The Shockwave Rider," his 1975 novel in
which uber-hacker Nickie Halflinger uses worms to disable Big Brother's
panopticon network.

Having said this, Fred Cohen deserves credit for seriously studying
properties of replicating programs, including viruses. (And I believe he
coined the term virus, and also showed how it differs from a worm.) I will
make no particular claims about how _much_ credit he deserves, as this
seems petty. Nearly all discoveries have precursors, of course.

The work on worms clearly was a precursor. Also, general biological work on
replicating patterns was already going on, and Richard Dawkins' "The
Selfish Gene" had been published in the 1970s (and I believe the work on
replicating information patterns--memes--was important).

His views should be taken on their merits, not on whether or not he was the
first to study viruses or replicating programs in general.

As it happens, I find much of what Fred Cohen writes to be tedious and
repetitive, but not because he has gotten "too much" credit for his early
work.
