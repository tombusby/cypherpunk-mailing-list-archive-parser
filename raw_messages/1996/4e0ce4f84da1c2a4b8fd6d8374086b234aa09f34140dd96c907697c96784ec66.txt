Well put. And where is there a model that works? In Switzerland we have a 
model of 148 years of true democracy, where the people propose and vote 
on legislation. One result is that "pork-barrell" is mimimal, because 
citizens won't vote for it! Libertarians would generally prefer it to 
government by a parasitic ruling class. And libs could propose and 
perhaps pass laws to try out their ideas. 

Here you are limited to begging for mercy. Sure, theoretically, encrypted 
financial transactions on the 'net will inhibit taxation, but Congress 
seems likely to nip that in the bud, massive begging notwithstanding.

The 'net could be used for the interaction of true democracy (along with 
the more available Plain Old Telephone System, fax, paper, etc), as well
as for beggary.

The Swiss experience for 148 years is available for review from the very
