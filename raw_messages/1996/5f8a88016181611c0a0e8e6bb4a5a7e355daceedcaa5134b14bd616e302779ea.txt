  Friend, 
 
 
  02 08 95 Bloomberg newsstory datelined Chicago, headlined 

          AMERITECH, BELL ATLANTIC AGREE TO SHARE 
                    CALLER ID DATABASES 
 
  reports: 
 
    In December, the Federal Communications Commission mandated 
    that caller ID should be available nationwide and that long- 
    distance companies must carry a caller's name, as well as the 
    number. 
 
 
  But... 
 
    Long-distance companies, which will now be able to compete for 
    customers with the Baby Bells, have dragged their feet, and did- 
    n't carry the names.... 
 
 
  Which means: 
 
    ...it will be up to local phone companies to form alliances.... 
 
 
  The latest example: 
 
    Ameritech Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp. said they will swap cus- 
    tomer data bases to better carry caller ID calls between their 
    regions. 
 
 
  Back in December Ameritech 
 
    ...signed a similar agreement with U S West.... 
 
 
  And generally, 
 
    ...local phone companies [must] form alliances like the one be- 
    tween Ameritech and Bell Atlantic to offer nationwide caller ID. 
 
 
                              For 
 
                              OUR 
 
                           eyes only! 
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim
