   There is no restriction on non-export keysize, as far as I know. Of 
course, if you do use a key larger than 1024 bits, then export clients 
can not encrypt to you. I don't consider this to be a serious 
limitation. I'd far rather see an error message of "cannot encrypt to 
client - your software is crippled" than "encrypting to recipient with 
super-duper 40-bit cipher". The more crippled the export version appears 
to be, the more pressure there is to upgrade to a non-export version.

   I object to the word "domestic" to refer to non-crippled encryption 
programs. I use "non-export" because that seems least likely to cause 
confusion. Keep in mind that clients developed outside the US are also 
non-crippled. The word "domestic" seems to unfairly exclude them.
