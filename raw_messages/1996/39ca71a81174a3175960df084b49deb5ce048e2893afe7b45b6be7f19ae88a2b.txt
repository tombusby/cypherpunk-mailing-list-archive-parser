That was not an explanation, that was mystic word salad.  

It would be an explanation if wealth mysteriously rained
from the sky, rather than was produced by men.

In fact what gets sent to the Indian campus is largely legacy
work, which is in large part precisely the work that requires 
the closest contact with the customer, contact with actual 
working conditions, and the like.

This seems to be a general practice, not just an Informix practice, for
in an article on "India's silicon valley" I read that the work done in
India was largely done on existing legacy apps, often in obsolete
languages and operating systems.

This is of course the work that places the least amount of the
companies intellectual assets in India, and thus the work that
gives the Indian government the least power over Informix and its
activities.  Informix could abandon the Indian campus and all
the intellectual assets on which it was working, and all the
physical assets located there, at any moment and not suffer any 
serious loss or inconvenience.

It is overwhelmingly clear that the question is simply who has the 
power?  Those who wish to hire peoples services in order to produce
wealth, or those who can command peoples services because they have
guns?

That is what makes most people in some places poor and most people 
in some places affluent.

Presumably the same kind of reasons as caused foreign companies
to flee India the first time around.
