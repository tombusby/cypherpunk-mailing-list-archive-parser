Hmmm...  sorry, I thought that was obvious.  Well, perhaps not "obvious," 
but it's one of those facts that will become second nature to people once AP 
starts up.

As can be expected, people will be looking out for themselves in an 
AP-dominated system, just as today.  I think most people will have a fairly

justified hit can be fairly anonymous.
