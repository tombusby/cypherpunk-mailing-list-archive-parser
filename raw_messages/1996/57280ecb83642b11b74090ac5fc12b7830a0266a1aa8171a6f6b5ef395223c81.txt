Well, the existence of "3" changes the problem entirely, as does
a system of prioritization.  Under these rules, Robber 1 would
propose an even split, eleven ways, and it would probably be
accepted.  That keeps a majority alive, and a majority get
some money (~2M each).  Without that, I'd tend to concur
with the other answers (19 & 20 each get $10M).

If we have to actually give a damn about each other...  :)
