This kind of testimony shows exactly why we (individual citizens) can't 
trust corporations to guard our interests in the crypto arena:

Look at this closely, and Mastercard's position, and you'll notice that 
Lisker has no obvious professional interest in encouraging the _increasing_ 
of penalities for the "reexportation and resale of this technology to 
questionable buyers, including criminals."  (In a contest between Mastercard 
armed with good encryption, and criminals armed with similar tools, 
Mastercard will win, because winning simply involves keeping the crooks away 
from its money.)  Lisker is also presumably smart enough to know that few 
people are going to go into an "Encryption Store" and say, "I'm a criminal!  
Could I buy your best encryption, please?"    

Yet, despite no obvious reason for Lisker's interest, he's pushing the "no 
crypto to bad guys" buttons, so he's obviously sucking up to the politicians 
in an area he has no reason to.  It sounds to me like a deal is being 
struck, and I'm certain the public will be on the short end of that deal.

Why can these thugs just accept the fact that crypto will get into the hands 
of people that governments don't want it to?
