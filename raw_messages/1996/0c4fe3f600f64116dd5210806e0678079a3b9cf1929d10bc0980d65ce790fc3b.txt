Just as a technical aside, the "entry" vests are becoming much more common,
and can often stop up to 7.62 NATO, sometimes even .30-06 AP rounds. The
handgun rounds don't even faze wearers of this vest. They'd be likely to go
through the Lexan face shields, though (hint hint...Mozambique drill).

Same bunch are also working to ban civilian ownership of bullet-resistant
vests...seems like a pattern developing here, doesn't it?
