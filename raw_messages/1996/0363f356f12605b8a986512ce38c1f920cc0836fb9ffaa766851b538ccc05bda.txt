I thought of that for a long time.

 - Use a microphone on your sound card and locate it close to the computer
fan.
 - generate a (relatively short) set of random number, maybe using the PRNG of
the
      computer.
 - Use the LSB of the sampled sound, the sampling being done at intervals fixed
by
     the serie of numbers generated by the PRNG.
 - when the numbers generated by the prng are exausted, re-use part of the
output stream
     as a random source of numbers for the sampling interval.

 - keep doing this up until:
     1) you are fed up of looking at RND numbers on your screen
     2) you have no use for rnd numbers anymore
     3) your hard disk is full
     4) your computer cpu is so mixed up that it starts outputting all your PGP
encrypted
        files in Serbo-Croatian cleartext
     5) any other reasons deemed reasonable by the computer operator
     6) none of the above

Whaddyathink of it?
