Deranged Mutant is absolutely right.  There are about 150 (or so)
governments in the world.  When people talk about making keys available to
government (or law enforcement), always ask, "Which governments can access
these keys?"  If I were a non-French corporation, I would feel distinctly
nervous if the answer included France.  (There are a number of other
countries where the security services have also been suspected of engaging
in industrial espionage.)
