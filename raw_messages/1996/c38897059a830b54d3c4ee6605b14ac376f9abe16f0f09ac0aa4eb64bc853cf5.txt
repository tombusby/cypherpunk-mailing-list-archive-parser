My point was that you need more than just information (but see below).  You
also need some materials that may be hard to get.  Being totally ignorant
in the anthrax growing area, I have no idea where I would get my starter
bacteria.  (Presumably any net-info would tell me.  I haven't looked.)

Oh well, if not this year, then next people will be able to down load any
virus/bacteria they want.  Come the millennium, it will be plants, with
mice and rats to follow.

I have no problem with your point.  Mine was intended as sarcasm.
