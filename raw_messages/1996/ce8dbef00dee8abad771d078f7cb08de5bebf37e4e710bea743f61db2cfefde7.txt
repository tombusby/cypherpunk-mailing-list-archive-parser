Liar.  Since they got rid of the old Bell, Stanford is as good as
Netcom in their top level functions, I retreived the above page in
a few seconds, it's the terminals and stuff which cause the problems.
You, for instance, only use Micro$oft, so you lose out on the use
of Stanford's T3's, which I use all the time whenever I'm logged in
to Netcom.  As if there's anybody stupid enough to use Micro$oft
for networking, much less Dial-ups!

I was wrong, I was just Dicked a few forge-cancels.  He got angry
of course, when I added misc.test, which means he can't continue
to forge-cancel without quickly alerting me.

You could explain to us what you are talking about,
but that would threaten your B1!?3 status.

Great idea.  For stormfront.
BTW, can you forge-request another archives for me?
I saw a couple of letters before losing the rest.
I'm trying to work novell dos with linux and making
a general mess of things.  Picked up an unwrapped
copy for $40, is that a good deal?

Never noticed it.

Never noticed it.  You folks are just so damned paranoid.
The government's not out to get you, just help you.
