	For those that use emacs (and you should :), there's a version
of GNUS (the newsreader) that has a neat scoring feature.  Unlike a kill
file which only gets rid of articles, scoring will automagically assign
a negative (i.e. kill it) or positive (i.e. interesting) score to articles.
You can manually rate articles or threads, or you can let Gnus use what
the author of the package calls "artificial stupidity" to assign points
based on whether or not you read a particular message.  I've been using
it on news for a couple of days now and it's starting to pickup some of
my reading habits.  It will also work on mail files (now if I can only
get MH installed where my mail feed comes in I'll be set :).  It also can
access shared global score files using anon-ftp, so if someone want's to
start a CP scoring service . . . .
