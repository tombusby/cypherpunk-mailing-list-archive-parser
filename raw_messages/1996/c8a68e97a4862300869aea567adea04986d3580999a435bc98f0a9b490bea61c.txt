anyone heard of "memes"? cryptoanarchy is a virus of weak minds without any 
defense mechanisms. the cpunk list is the principal vector..

So, Nuri-logical, are you one of those NSA tentacles on the list, 
discouraging people from following certain ideas - like Tim's, for example? 
  <g>

Are you feeling a bit in-Timmy-dated by the possibility of a crypto reign 
of terror; do you feel a bit like you're part of that stuff floating at the 
top about to be skimmed off?

What do you think would be a good antidote for this cryptoanarchy virus? 
 How do you imagine that it might be introduced into the Brave New World of 
anarchocapitalism; how could it effectively counter the growth of 
libertarian ideals, which you despise?

Tim sort of evaded my question by asserting that the methods of which he 
spoke were implicit in his writings.  I hope you don't claim the same, but 
are more blatant and explicit about your ideas to the contrary (though 
typically you are blatant, although not necessarily explicit).
