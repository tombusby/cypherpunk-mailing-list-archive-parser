	Quite. Besides which, what's wrong with something being "unnatural"?
If you define doing something to modify how one naturally
thinks/behaves/whatever as "unnatural", then all education is unnatural, child
raising is unnatural, etcetera; all these modify neural patterns in the long
run.
	All this is more in the area of transhumanism than of cypherpunks, BTW,
although I can see some _possible_ relevance.

	I wasn't, and I won't be when I go back on it (shortly, I hope). I
noticed the difference that it made (as did my teachers), and I preferred it.

	Most definitely agreed. While on it, I found myself much better able to
do what _I_ ultimately wanted to do.
