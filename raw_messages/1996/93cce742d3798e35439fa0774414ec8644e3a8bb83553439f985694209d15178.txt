        hey, logos wants to perform a service.  however, let's keep the
    wailing, weeping, and gnashing of teeth on the sidelines with direct
    mail to the group involved instead of cluttering the list with yet 
    more noise (like this waste of time).

::
    you're not unusual, in the first place since many high performers 
    just were not willing to waste time in a slow paced and probably
    parochial (not religion connotation) school.

    as for a the attitude, Dale has carried right on without taking
    a break.  as for being less wired and neurotic, I doubt it --Dale's
    into big time, including picking on anyone who he deems inferior
    and or maybe even "Children of a Lesser god."

::I'm sure (if you know crypto topics) you realize that in creating a
::crypto solution, there's no substitute for rigorous attention to detail. 
::I'm not opposed to paying some attention to decorum, but logic comes
::first, otherwise, you won't have a leg to stand on.
::
    and to prove your own point --but not in your favour:  since when
    did logic preclude decorum. that's sort of follows the rule:

        "profanity is the refuge of inarticulate motherfuckers."

    when you blow you own logic by being profanely indecorus. And I'll
    say it again, and again:

        if the residents of cypherpunk land can not express themselves
    with respect for their colleages, even in disagreement, then cp is
    a has been and will be quoted in ridicule by the news organizations
    and the Congress as an anarchistic bunch of uncivilized and uncouth
    barbarians screaming "cryptography and anarchy for the masses."

        Is that what you want?
