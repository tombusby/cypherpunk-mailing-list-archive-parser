There are a number of small countries that aren't part of the 
US/European/Chinese/Singaporean Hegemonies, where telecom is expensive
and
Fidonets and uucp are the way to get email there.  If you're willing to
pay some money to support one, you might get some real anonymity
for financially critical data.  Also, there are periodic articles
in magazines like Wired about how George Soros is wiring the Balkans;
perhaps someone there would like to make some money running remailers.

If you are willing to go that route, you can setup a Fidonet mailer VERY
easily, and send 
mail that looks like it is from any of the 36000 bulletin boards in the
nodelist. Generally 
it will be refused by a board that has a session password. However, it is
exceedingly 
unlikely that a bbs in Singapore would have a passworded session with a
bbs in Texas.  You 
could send it randomly to a BBS using the name of another random board.
However, this would 
probably be very very very UNPOPULAR, particularly if someone got nailed
because of it. It 
would be better to work it out with some sysop in a small 3rd world
country...

Alternately, if you were to run a board, it is VERY simple to fake the
addressing on a 
Fidonet mail packet...
