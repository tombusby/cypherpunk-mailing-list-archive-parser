My bigest worry about Java security is the size of its "security kernel". 
Having a small, well defined, security kernel is a big advantage.  All the
better if the source is available for public review.  Java has a large, and
to me somewhat undefined "security kernel".

(BTW - I havn't been able to find on the web pages the kind of overview of
the libraries which would make the detailed method descriptions make sense.
 Perhaps I havn't looked in the right place.)
