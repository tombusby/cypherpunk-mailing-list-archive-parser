"I have seen it repeated here often that somehow compelled identity is
some kind of a 'right' that one should have in all kinds of different &
important transaction, not merely on 'cyberspace debate societies.'  I see
here frequently the implication that *private*entities* that want to
enforce compelled identity in their own transactions are somehow
implementing a corrupt, orwellian system."

(That put it into prespective for you "Vlad?")

You are twisting, "Vlad."  

If you really think that the issue is one of what specific times
government can demand anonymous transactions you overestimate the role of
government as well as the ability to demand such transactions on a per
situation rather than "as a whole" basis.

For example.  A friend of mine has never had a social security number or a
drivers license with his real name on it.  He has effectively had nothing
but anonymous transactions with anyone who thought that by asking him for
a SSN or driver's license they were getting identity credentials.  His
basis is philsophical, not criminal.  I might add that he lives quite
normally, works for a big mainstream company, and pays taxes.  Every once
in a while he switches his credentials around a bit to avoid paper
trailing.

Please, if you can, point out the harm he is inflicting.

You can't.  There is none.  The harm you can identify is the classic "but
it might be used for... [insert nastiness in vogue this week here]"

It is reasonable for any private parties to refuse to do business with or
otherwise associate with parties who refuse to divulge their identity.
Government in a CryptoAnarchist Utopia will have a very hard time doing
business with anyone if they make this a requirement I think.

Tell me "Vlad," if government won't, who will?
I submit that it is impossible to enforce compelled identity other than
through government.  I also submit that to do it you have to create a
registration process for all mediums.  Pay phones, ISPs, private leaflets,
cash... etc... etc.

So long as cash and payphones exist, (or so long as cash and pre-paid
cellular exists) so will anonymous transactions.

Again, the question is, what are you going to do to prevent, e.g., me,
"Black Unicorn" from publishing as I do now?

Crap.  Such a system exists today.  It's called the "filter."

If you don't want to transact with anonymous people, then IGNORE them.
Why impose compelled disclosure on everyone?
