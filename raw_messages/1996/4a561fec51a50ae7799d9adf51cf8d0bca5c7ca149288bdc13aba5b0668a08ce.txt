	How difficult would it be to set up a router protocol to automatically
select any from a series of other routers that announced itself willing (for a
certain amount of ecash, perhaps)? I had thought that this was pretty close to
the case in any event, for small networks anyway - and connections between
small networks can interconnect into one large network.

	Directly proportional? I'd think there would have to be somewhat of
a fixed cost involved. The question is whether the fixed cost (including the
cost of a router to handle the ever-increasing bandwidth) is dropping faster
than the cost of the number of connections. And your "normal traffic" doesn't
seem to be including Internet Phone, which I can see being a major source of
bandwidth in the future.
