Take a look at how implementations of identd (RFC 1413) do it.  This daemon
associates a TCP port with its UID, but I'm sure the PID is very close by
in the netstat data structures.  It might actually find the PID first, then
look up its owner's UID.

Anyway, look at the pidentd stuff at ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/ident/.
