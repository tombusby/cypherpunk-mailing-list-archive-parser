   "Expert Panel Wants Intelligence Director to Hold More
   Power."

      The commission finds that the patchwork of 14 separate
      intelligence agencies is functioning well in its current
      form. To meet tbe growing threat of worldwide criminal
      activity the panel suggested creation of a high-level
      policy group run out of the White House, called tbe
      Global Crime Committee. It would be chaired by the
      president's national security adviser and would include
      the AG, State, DoD, and the DCI.

   "Turner: CIA Nearly Used A Journalist in Tehran."

      CIA's covert operators do not want to reopen the debate.
      As Turner put it, "Is the media case stronger than
      businessmen or academics? The covert operators are
      worried that we may reach a point where prohibitions
      will get us down to where there is nobody left to spy
      but the Foreign Service."

   3-1-96. NYT:

   "Commission Recommends Streamlined Spy Agencies."

      Most of the changes the report will recommend are
      evolutionary, not revolutionary. Intelligence officials
      used the same word to describe it: "underwhelming." The
      report fails to answer the big overstaffing problem. An
      official said the resistance within the intelligence
      agencies to staff cutting would be so strong that the
      downsizing would never happen.
