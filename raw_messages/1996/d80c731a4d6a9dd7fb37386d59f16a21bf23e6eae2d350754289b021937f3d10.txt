in any practical or semi-practical application, you'll have to have a way to decompress the 
perfectly compressed data.  A dictionary?  A Huffman-tree-ish sort of thing?  Are you going
to transfer it out-of-band?  **It** becomes the target of interest.

I never though of that.

yeah, these two are reasonably unlikely to occur together (only a 
reasoned guess, anyone got any comments on this?)
so we really have a weakish system.

Yeah, this is still a form of brute force but I was thinking of this 
in terms of a smallish (sub 200 bit) key, so brute force against 
solutions with 0 entropy is a realistic possibility.
