Oh, we remember it :-).  But actually, large chunks of the Internet's
facilities _are_ on controlled or semi-controlled media, such as 
frame relay (which the Feds just insisted had to be tariffed) or
local private-line (which is often regulated by state PUCs.)
But in those cases, the regulation is at the price/quantity/schedule
layer, rather than the content layer.

And according to someone I talked to recently, the Network Access Points,
MAE-East/West, (though not CIX), are still NSF-funded, even though they're
often built
and run by folks like PacBell - I'd thought we'd gotten rid of those guys
a couple of years ago except for the NIC and Internic.
