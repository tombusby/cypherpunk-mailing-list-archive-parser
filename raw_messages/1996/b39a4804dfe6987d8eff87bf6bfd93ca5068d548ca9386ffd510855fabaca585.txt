[This has nothing to do with cryptography, but it is

Miami Herald reports today on page 3A that the National
Transportation Safety Bureaucrats are "investigating an
American Airlines pilot's report that a missile zoomed
by his 757 on Aug. 29 as it flew near NASA and Navy
facilities in Virginia on its way to Boston."

An NTSB spokesman has confirmed an investigation (termed
a 'preliminary probe') is ongoing. Not to be outdone,
the FAA is investigating as well. All this is according
to the Herald, and I offer no opinions about veracity or
trustworthiness of this particular media organ or what
caused the crash of flight 800.
