Also known as "civil disobedience," a dangerous concept which
is probably being taught today in civics classes in highschools
across the nation. [HORRORS!]

On a more serious note, I think that the requirements on the
Netscape download page might actually be a "Good Thing," since
they expose the public, in an election year, to the info-lust
of the GAK crowd in a way that cypherpunks alone never could.

I, too, wish that "my life as an arms trafficker," or the CJR
book/t-shirt requests, or some of the wilder stuff like Vince's
export-a-cryptosystem-to-Anguilla page were linked to Netscape's
page discussing ITAR requirements, but I fully understand that
Netscape is a business and that they must deal, on a continuing
basis, with the government. The government officials whose jobs
depend on stupid regs. can be rather humor-impaired.
