Impossible is an awfully strong word.

If I was going to implement free digital stamps, I'd have a autoreply
daemon (stamps@remailer.com) that when sent a mail, would respond with X
number of valid stamps.  If you're going to trust me not to log my remailer
traffic, extending that trust to believing I won't log the stamp requests
shouldn't be that much of a stretch.

Alternatively, the stamp could consist of a unique-id, any unique-id,
working identically to Usenet message ids.  That way, the user can generate
his own stamps without being forced to trust the remailer operator not to
log them.

I prefer the second option as it has both greater anonymity and allows for
simple history file patching to the remailer.

Either way, if the stamps/message-ids are forced to be inside the encrypted
address block, mail-bombers can only get one message through.  Even if the
HNGs are instructed to add a stamp and re-encrypt the address block, when
the spam-o-grams start getting routed through the pre-packaged route,
they'll be stopped dead after one message gets through.
