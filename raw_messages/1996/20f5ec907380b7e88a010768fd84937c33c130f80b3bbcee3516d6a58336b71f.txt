There's an RSAEURO drop-in clone of RSAREF that's on ftp.ox.ac.uk,
so you could write a version of your software that lets Yankees and
non-Yankees drop in whichever version is appropriate without worrying
about patent or copyright problems.  Any* RSAREF system used in the US
has the problem that it's limited to the "official" interfaces,
which means you can't do fully general RSA without permission.

(* There was one RSAREF version that didn't insist on this in
its license; don't remember which one.)
