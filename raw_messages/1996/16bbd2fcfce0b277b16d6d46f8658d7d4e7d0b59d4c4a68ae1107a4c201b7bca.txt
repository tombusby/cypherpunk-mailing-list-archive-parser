I find that less likely, personally.  In any case it should
be understood that they are separate threats, which should
be considered separately.  Solving one will not solve the
other, but by leaving _both_ unsolved you increase your 
risk.

I apologize for mistakenly thinking that you had no
signatures.  Furthermore, I take back what I said about you
not being sufficiently conscious of man in the middle
attacks.


So now we have connections to the Web O Trust, and some
degree of confidence that you are alert to the possibility
of MITM attacks.  All I need to do is assure myself that
each person between you and I on the Web O Trust is
similarly engaging in counter-MITM measures...
