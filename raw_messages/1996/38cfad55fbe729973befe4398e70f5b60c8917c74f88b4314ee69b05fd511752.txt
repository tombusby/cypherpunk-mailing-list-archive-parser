SCOOPS AND TOP STORIES


IBM PLAYS DOCTOR
Big Blue is developing an innovative Internet "immune system" that intends
to do battle with one of the Internet's nastiest hazards - viruses.

NET BOOM ELUDES MAIN STREET
We've all heard the seductive hum of the buzzwords: e-commerce, online
advertising, new economic paradigm, secure commerce. And yet, many of those
who actually put their sites where their mouths are seem to find one sound
to be conspicuously absent: the happy cha-ching of the digital cash register.

BATTLES WITH GATES...PRICING SNAFUS...HUGE QUARTERLY LOSS? NO PROBLEM FOR AOL!
A mere six weeks after a white-knuckled corporate bungee jump during which
its stock plummeted to the 22-3/8 mark--AOL's stock rose more than 13
percent in a single day. A major factor in this comeback is the "big news"
(300,000 subscribers' worth) expected to be announced at the firm's
semiannual partners' conference tomorrow.

DEC AND CARRERA TEAM UP TO CREATE 500-MHz WORKSTATIONS AND SERVERS
Aiming at Internet, scientific, and multimedia markets with their insatiable
appetites for processing power, the DEC/Carrera team can boast about
offering one of the fastest processors in the world. That is, until 1997,
when the race gets even faster.
