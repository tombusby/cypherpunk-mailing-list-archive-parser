First of all, Bill S. was suggesting that the $60B figure is too low 
to be convincing to certain crucial people. Arguing that the figure should 
probably be even lower can only lend weight to that argument.

Secondly, as I'm sure you'll agree, mass media reports and advertising can
sway public opinion. IMHO cypherpunks should not hesitate to use those tools
to further our cause. Putting a specific number, almost any number, on the
anticipated opportunity cost drives the point home with a lot of people. Now
most reasonable people know (I think) that projections are based on 
assumptions that turn out to be partially wrong, for various reasons. But
they still form useful premises for debate. (I have the current U.S. federal 
budget battle in the back of my mind here.)
