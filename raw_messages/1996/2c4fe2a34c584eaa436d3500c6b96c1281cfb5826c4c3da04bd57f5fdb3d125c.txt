One solution to this is to have a database that 'generalizes' its
answers as it provides them.  For example, rather than returning 

Clay Olbon, 32, m, left handed, cholesterol 350, bp 200/160, 5'9", 175#, 
it would return:
fooblat martin,25-35, m, left handed, cholest. 3-400, 5.5-6ft, heavy.

researchers could then provide ranges to get answers.  Thus, if I'm
very concerned about the correlation between age and weight, I could
get that information very specifically and nothing else.

The generalization filter could be written to only allow N queries of
a given level of detail, so that the more detail you wanted in one
area, the more you give up in others.

There could be a review comittee (This is the way hospitals & medical
research works) to review requests for more specific data.

Doctors like having names, so you could genrate arbitrary names for
patients, or use a sylable genarator to come up with pronounceable
nonsense.
