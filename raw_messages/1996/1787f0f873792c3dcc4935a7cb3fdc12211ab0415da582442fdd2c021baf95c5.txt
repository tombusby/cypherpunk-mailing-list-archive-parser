        NO, NO, NO!  you have propounded an absurdity. The truth is:

        Your "bunch of stupid college kids" are the only ones who _do_
    understand.  They simply are still young enough to sincerely believe
    they have inately been blessed with all the assimilated knowledge of
    the generations!

        You must progress to an old man before you fully comprehend that
    true knowledge has eluded you in your miniscule slice of infinite 
    time and _your_ future is not truly limitless. 

        so spake Attila!
