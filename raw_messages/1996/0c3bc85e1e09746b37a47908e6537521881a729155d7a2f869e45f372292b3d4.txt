Steps to changing US encryption policies:
(Note, you must be logged in as US President for this to work.)

1.  Try to bug everyone's phone and computer with special chips.

2.  Get your butt kicked at and missed by technical weenies, and 
    eventually stomped on by your own national research council.

3.  Wait for Congress to show leadership.  (Lose two turns if you 
    actually thought they would do something.) (Return)

4.  Try to tap everything without using any special chips. (Goto 2)

5.  See if any other governments want you to be able to tap their
    stuff, too.

6.  Try to tap everything with half the key tied behind your back
    when you start.  (Goto 2)

7.  Issue the new policies.

to expect from Net Scout, we've added an increased emphasis on analysis and
insight. Sections include: Searching the Internet, Latest Tools and
Technologies, End User's Corner, Net Scout Sidekicks, a Selective Guide to
Publications on the Internet, and Future Internet Directions. The new
Toolkit is mirrored on three sites to allow Internauts unhindered access.
