HACKERPUNKS-OWNER ANSWERS: Actually if you were a "haker", 
you should be worried REGARDLESS of who runs this List: 
FBI/CIA/Stasi agents can trivially create an alias like 
FBI@alpha.c2.org and SUBSCRIBE to this List. They would
know all Information that is available to the List-owner,
except the subscriber-list. But, the subscriber-list is
useless because of Anonymity.

Even if alpha.c2.org were an FBI run Site, its Users
must use Anonymous-remailers to access it. That
preserves their Privasy.

HACKERPUNKS-OWNER ANSWERS: There is a minor Error in 
your current Post.  L(In) <> L(Posted) because of prepended
Headers. For Protection, hackerpunks List receives some 
Junk-mail, automatically trashed, to create Noise.

HACKERPUNKS-OWNER _A_D_V_I_S_E_S_ Sameer Parekh and 
GhiO to add Code to their Alpha-remailer to insert 
Random-Size Header 'X-Random-Noise:' before Encryption 
of Messages sent to Users of alpha.c2.org Accounts.
Other Remailers are advised to change the Size of
these Header Lines.

HACKERPUNKS List-bot adds a Random-size Kookie to every
outgoing Message to preserve Privacy of Subscribers.
