I asked Peter Neumann, of the NRC commission whose report is due
very very soon, and they did indeed get "The Briefing".  He was
very keen to have all appendices of the final report be public,
we may get to see the story there.

I am just on pins and needles waiting for the report.  I thought,
when it was announced, that in the year-and-a-half that it would take
to write that the war would be won.  It hasn't, of course.  I think
that the NRC report will define the landscape of the debate for the
next year or so.  We'll see.
