>    The phone rings again at 11:30 p.m. And again. And again. Wrong

>

>    home phone number.
> 
>    That night, when the next wrong number came in, Suponcic interrogated

>    at the bottom of some pictures of naked women that had been posted to
>    a Usenet newsgroup called alt.binaries.pictures.erotica, which,
>    naturally, Suponcic had never heard of. But he had a friend in
>    Cleveland who was something of a computer buff. So the next day the
>    two of them jacked into Usenet and spent three hours sifting through
>    about 7,400 files on alt. binaries.etc.
> 
>    Eventually, they found two with Suponcic's phone number. One featured
>    a topless brunet wearing only a string of pearls and offering phone
>    calls for "as low as 87 [cents] per minute." The other showed a blond
>    woman advertising "hot amateur wives ready for you from there [sic]
>    own bed." Yikes.
> 
>    Over the next week, Suponcic received more than 75 calls a day from
>    lusty Netizens. "You just could not make phone calls," says the
>    exasperated councilman. "And when you went to bed, you had to take
>    your phone off the hook."

> 
>    Suponcic, being a public official, knew his way around the local
>    police department, and soon a detective started pounding the Net. By
>    tracing the header information on the Usenet postings, the detective
>    determined--O.K., this part is murky, we admit--that the messages had
>    originated in Ohio, passed through Florida Online, an Internet
>    provider in the Sunshine State, and then through anon.penet.fi, a free
>    E-mail remailer service based in Finland that allows Internet users to
>    post messages anonymously.
> 
>    The identity of the poster was, and is, unknown, though Suponcic has

>    number and whose wife now wants to move.
> 
>    On Feb. 6, at Suponcic's urging, the Willowick city council passed a
>    resolution asking the state and federal governments to close the
>    "loopholes" that allowed anonymous remailers to operate outside the
>    authority of U.S. law-enforcement officials. "Once you've achieved one
>    of these anonymous identities, you're dangerous, and there's no way
>    law enforcement can track it," Suponcic says. "The animal's out of
>    control."
> 
>    Still not content, Suponcic contacted Steven LaTourette, the U.S.
>    Congressman who represents his district. LaTourette's staff suspects
>    that the problem lies with Julf Helsingius, the Finn who runs the
>    anonymous remailer. They wrote a letter to the Finnish ambassador and
>    sent copies to the Secretary of State and the chairman of the House
>    Committee on International Relations. The State Department agreed last
>    week to look into the complaint.
> 
>    But here's a reality check. The Finnish remailer could not have been

>    Jerry Russell, who runs Florida Online and who looked into the case,
>    says he figures the whole thing was a relatively simple prank called a

>    the posting for him so that he could unravel the tangle for them.
