I always use my true name and am happy to spread it far and wide, but 
I have been doing some work for a GroupWare manufacturer.  They have 
seen that even in a corporate environment where information sharing is 
practised and embraced, sometimes people want to make a comment and 
not take the heat for making that comment.  This can provide some 
constructive input, so they have a anonymous comment feature built 
in.  So you could say that it is absolutely necessary for the web 
to have that feature as well.
