First, the ITAR are not laws, but regulations. Second, there are many that
believe that applying ITAR to crypto software is already expanding the
scope of the regulations far beyond what they were intended to mean.

Let us not forget that the ITAR were written to prevent the proliferation
of military technology. Applying them to mass market crypto software does
not aid this original goal in any way. At one point, the existing ITAR
began to be used to further a cause utterly unrelated to their original
intend: limiting the domestic market penetration of strong crypto systems.
