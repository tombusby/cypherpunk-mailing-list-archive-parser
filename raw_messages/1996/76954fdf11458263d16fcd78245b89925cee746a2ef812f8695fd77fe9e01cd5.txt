Why should this be true?  I can still walk to a pay telephone, put in a 
quarter, dial a random number and talk to somebody anonymously.  The various 
Baby Bell companies aren't "held accountable" if it's an obscene phone call.

I think that any attempt to hold the Internet to standards higher than 
existing services is a mistake.

Isn't the whole purpose of anonymity (remailers and such) in order to ensure 
that the messages AREN'T traceable?!?
