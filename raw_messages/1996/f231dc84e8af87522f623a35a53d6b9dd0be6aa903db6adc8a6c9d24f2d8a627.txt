I have yet to see the original bill myself, it is not posted on 
Thomas yet, but I too have ready the VTW version.

I agree with your concerns here, but I find it hard to believe that 
the courts would allow a broader interpretation.

Here you are dead wrong, the bill specifically states: "in furtherance 
of a felony."  Its like those laws that let them charge someone with 
murder in the first if someone dies while you are commiting another 
felony.  They must prove the original felony before they can get you 
on the murder one.  The real purpose of this provision, as I read it, 
is to give longer sentences to criminals that use crypto.

Again, the problem I see with your scenario is that I don't believe 
that the courts will interpret it that way.  My interpretation is that 
if they serve a warrent and I don't decrypt for them and they can 
prove a felony, then I will be subject to the listed punishment.

I disagree, it states you must "willfully endeavor" to use the 
encryption as a means of obstructing the investigation.  To me, this 
means that it is the motivation for using the encryption.  If I set 
up an encrypting remailer for the purpose of allowing free exchange 
of ideas, I don't believe I would be liable under this law.  The 
only way I could see a remailer charged under this is if he had solid 
evidence that a specific user was violating the law, and took no 
action.

I see some real problems too, but I do not see the problems with this 
provision to be enough to condemn the entire bill.  I would like to 
see this portion of the bill ammended to make it clear that only 
those actually involved in commiting the felony would be held 
responsible.

You are talking about the fringe, this, I think, was added as an 
attempt to bring in those that are in the middle.  That is, Those 
that see the need to prevent the use of encryption as a means of 
obstructing justice, but feel that we should also have a right to 
privacy.  To say that there is no delema here is ridiculous, crime is 
a serious problem that we are already having a terrible time dealing 
with.  I think Leahy realizes that this provision will be about as 
useful as the "use a gun, go to jail" laws, but wants to give those 
in the middle to say that they bill will help prevent crime.
