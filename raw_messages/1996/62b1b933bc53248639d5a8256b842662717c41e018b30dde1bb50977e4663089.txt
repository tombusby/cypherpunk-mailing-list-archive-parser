Go back and reread at this time. Notice that I didn't mention *who*
was censored. The error of interpretation was the initial story's 
slant on censorship. I merely expounded on the *story's* slant.

But still subjective, and hence still subject to political
availability should the need to criticize Vulis arise.

For me, yes. Not for most people. I take it you expect *everyone* to
have a UNIX machine connected to the net to ensure free speech?

I didn't. (and here we go...)

The plausibility is not in question, the example is meant to
illustrate the ludicrousness of the "ownership" concept when applied
to public mailing lists (and by extension *any* public media).

Are you saying "since this is implausible, the point is invalid"? 
We'll both have fun with that one.

AT&T tried it. They were just unlucky.

       Self justification is worse than the the original transgression.
