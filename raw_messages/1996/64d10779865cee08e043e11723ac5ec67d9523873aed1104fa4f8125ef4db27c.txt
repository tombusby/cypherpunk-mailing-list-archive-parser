Once they run out of ammunition... Really, most weapons in the more
primitave parts of africa haf about 3 rounds of ammunition for them.
The bands of AK-welding poachers and the like are paramilitary groups
supported by professional poaching operations or they're fighting some
"benefactor" nation's dirty little wars for them. The media
representation is quite skewed, as is usually the case.

Given the nature of many of these governments, privately-owned
factories are a no-no.

There is no or little infrastructure to support large-scale private
lending in most African nations. THe government wants its 20% cut, or
the currency must be exchanged at artificial rates, or you must meet
rediculous regulatory requirements. And most of these governments are
not above making large amounts of people dissapear if they don't
follow the rules.

But to a large extent we agree. Private lending can be a very Good
Thing. However, given the current regulatory practices in many African
(and I assume most third world) nations, large-scale private lending
is not a viable solution. I mean, it really is a morass. Everyone has
to work within the system (this includes those wealthy enough to
ignore the laws and bribe their way through), and the system tends to
be large, cumbersome, and astoundingly slow.
