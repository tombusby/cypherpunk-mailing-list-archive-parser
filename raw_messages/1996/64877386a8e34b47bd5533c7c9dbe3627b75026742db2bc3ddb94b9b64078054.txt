Watch it.  I didn't write the above.

Free speech, except for some undesireables, who are defective because I
say so.  I'd call that contrary.

Hate is hate.  Period.  Listen to the KKK sometime.  It's not only the
color of one's skin that attracts their ire.

He can hate whomever he pleases.  When he begins to preach that those
individuals are somehow sub-human, defective, he is advocating anything
but freedom and free speech.  (Unless perhaps you could include in
"freedom" the freedom to put all those of a certain race or sexual
preference on an island somewhere and sink it).
