US News has an interesting story by by Peter Cary, Douglas Pasternak and 
Penny Loeb, about big mother's great care in disposing of surplus munitions; 
including, but not at all limited to, the encryption variety. For sale are 
attack helicopter parts, bombs, missiles, guidance systems, howitzer parts, 
computers, and yes, military cryptosystems.

While by law all these things are supposed to be "demilitarized," they 
aren't, in many cases. They are instead evidently sold as scrap (and at 
scrap prices) and go to nice countries like China. Maybe I'm missing 
something or being fooled, if it were closer to April 1st, I would doubt 
that this story is real.

According to an assistant U.S. attorney in Sacramento, "The scope of this 
program and the amount of materiel going out the door is so huge, people 
normally don't believe you. Only the government could have a program where 
they give everything away for free and they screw it up."

I couldn't have said it better myself... <sigh> And *they* think _WE_ need 
more "gun control."

One of the "legitimate concerns of law enforcement" seems to be
that I was born innocent until proven guilty and not the other
way around. -- me
