   The message cannot be delivered because the
   recipient's mailbox contains the maximum number of 
   messages, as set by the system administrator.  The
   recipient must delete some messages before any
   other messages can be delivered.
    The maximum message limit for a user's mailbox is 
   10,000.  The default message limit is 1000 messages.  
   Administrators can set message limits using the 
   Mailbox  Settings function available in the 
   Manage User menu  (MUSER). 

   When a user's mailbox reaches the limit, the 
   user must delete some of the messages before 
   the mailbox can accept any more incoming messages.

Paul:
   I think that if the cryptanalyst knows that F has zero redundancy
that he can run searches from 0 to n bits for the key and have
the computer flag solutions that have zero redundancy.  

   I also think that a perfectly compressed file would have a relative
entropy value close to one also, hence the computer could flag possibles 
that have both characteristics.

   Hence, instead of searching for plaintext by counting coincidences,
we are searching the decrypts for solutions that have zero redundancy
and a relative entropy value close to one.  How many solutions will
have both these qualities?  I don't know.  But if the compression method 
is known, brute force will be tried, and only having to try to 
decompress (read) data that has the resultant characteristics
of compressed information will speed things up by quite a bit.

   Others may disagree with my thought-experiment and my approach,
but I think this is quite possible ... even to persons with limited
computing resources.
