Agreed - a proper search algorithm should yield an answer in a few seconds, 
at most.

The reason I brought the idea up here was in the hope that others on the CP 
list could help work out the fussy details of the protocol: what info would 
need to be included for what types of exchanges, what port(s) would be good 
to work with, etc. Platform/implementation would be subject to considerable 
variation - but the idea would survive (hopefully :-)

Again, implementation on any particular platform using any particular OS 
would be up to the afficionados of said platforms/OS's. I'm more interested 
in the CP list coming up with the protocol/standards.
