Please hit your carriage return once in a while. I had to format your post
manually so I could read it.

If the destination server can pick the port you used, there's a good chance
they can figure out your account name, and therefore your email address.
Many sites these days run identd, which in my opinion is a simply annoying
daemon. Most of those that run it run it because some of their users, most
of whom couldn't find two brain cells to rub together, whine about their
precious IRC servers not allowing them on without it, instead of simply
using IRC servers that will.
