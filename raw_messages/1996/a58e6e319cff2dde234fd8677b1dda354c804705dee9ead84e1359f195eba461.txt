That would match my general impression of the way things have gone. 
Originally Microsoft was a small company that *had* to write good code
(anyone remember DR DOS?) to survive.  At the time, they had to do tons
of work producing usable products out of IBM's code. (Apparently due to
optimization, at one point MS was writing a negative total codelines for
OS/2 1.x)  Now, IBM is writing good code (Warp/Merlin/etc) and making
usable products out of MS blunders (Win-OS/2. It may crash (not quite as
much as the real Windows - separate sessions) but it doesn't bring down
the whole house...
