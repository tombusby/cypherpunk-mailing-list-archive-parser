Let's see if I understand you correctly.  The anti-child porn advocates are
only interested in votes and positioning themselves as more moral or
"better-than-thou"...

causing them to be unsympathetic to thinking?  

What in the devil are you trying to say?  Maybe I'm one of those stupid
citizen units.  I just don't get it - I'd like to, but I don't.  How about
rephrasing your comments so that us average citizen units can understand
your wisdom.

If there is logic to the wind-up, it escapes me.  It seems to me that the
appearance of being in total control (dictatorship) is the last thing any
politician in this country would want to be seen (seen being the operative
word) as attempting.  Is this message spoofed from that juno kid?
