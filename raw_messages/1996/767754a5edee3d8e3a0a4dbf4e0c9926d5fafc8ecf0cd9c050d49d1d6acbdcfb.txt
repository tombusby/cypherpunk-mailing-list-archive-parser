Yes, it is hard to know even which side is pulling the strings. The WW2
Italian fascist commando leader, Otto Skorzeny, not only rescued Mussolini
from a ski chalet, he also helped set up the PLO in the 1960s, and
consulted for the OSS, CIA, and such. (There is much more to say about
this, and about the role of the early NSA in such affairs. However,
continuing down this path will produce the inevitable perrygrams from the
acerbic Mr. Metzger demanding "What does this have to [whatever my current
interest is]?"))

I don't buy this. I said "talking about explosives on the Net," not openly
conspiring to plant bombs in federal buildings. A big difference. (Not that
I am aware of the OKC bombers discussing their plans on the Usenet.)

I am sandbagging by saying "5." I wasn't referring to 5 in, say, the U.S.,
but to 5 or so "horrific" bombs in Western countries, plus Israel. A second
Oklahoma City-type bombing may be enough, a Sarin attack that kills 1,000
will almost surely be enough. (In the bigger scheme of things, the 150-200
or so who died in OKC are a drop in the bucket, and I wouldn't advocate
_any_ new surveillance laws for them...putting a day care center in a soft
target demonstrates the callousness of the Feds.)

Let me use the language Bill Stewart used a while back, language which
skirts the issue of "right" and "wrong" even more neatly than I did (when I
said the Jews were "asking for trouble"):

"If a religious group uses force to expel the current occupants of a desert
region, and expels them to just beyond their borders, it is "unsurprising"
that those expelled, and their children, and their children's children,
will swear a blood oath to drive the group into the sea."

Put another way, I will not be "surprised" to wake up one morning and hear
on CNN that Tel Aviv has been vaporized in a nuclear explosion. Nor will I
be surprised to similarly learn that Damascus has been vaporized, and so
on.

Being an atheist, I treat all religious mystics as suspect. When a bunch of
people leave London and Chicago and Paris to live in the desert, surrounded
by sworn enemies with nuclear capabilities, I think whatever happens to
them is...."unsurprising."

I hope this makes my outlook clearer. (And Cypherpunks should fully
understand that information-trading systems and unbreakably encryption--the
very technologies we so ardently are pushing--make certain actions even
less "surprising" than might otherwise be the case. Think of it as
evolution in action.)
