Subject: a chat w/ Paul Strassman about his remailer article

Content-Type: text/plain


Now I have a firmer grasp on the dynamics of escalation. ;)
        A couple of notes. (1) The people Mr. Strassman CCed in his first
response remained CCed throughout; one of them is his co-author, William
Marlow (Senior Vice President, Science Applications International
Corporation [SAIC]). (2) He hasn't responded to my last mail, and probably
won't, at least in private; obviously, he's free to respond to it on
Cypherpunks. (3) I find his claims to understand and properly represent the
arguments for remailers to be, er, lacking: claims like "remailing
capabilities are operated [...] as a public service, almost always at no
charge because it costs so little to set one up," the absence of the
standard penet-type arguments--about support-group discussion re sexual
abuse etc.--speak for themselves, imo.
        Anyway:

>Greetings.
>        Your article on remailers <http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/
>anon-remail.html> was fascinating.
>        The "connection" you draw between disease and techniques of
>anonymity is arbitrary and tendentious: in place of a careful, sustained
>analysis of anonymous remailers _as such_, your article relies on a
>bizarre rhetorical substitution of disease for anonymity--"Information
>terrorism poses a threat; anonymity prevents punishment; the fact that
>legislative and policy bodies aren't dealing with the issue reminds me of
>the history of public medicine; therefore anonymity is a disease like
>AIDS; Russian criminals are using remailers; this is how remailers
>work..." This isn't an argument--it's a hodgepodge of free-associations
>and very peculiar allegations. What evidence is there that "the Russian
>(ex-KGB) criminal element" (whatever that is) constitutes a *statistically
>significant* segment of remailer-users? If they aren't statisticaly
>significant, why mention them? In the absence of any specific evidence, I
>can only assume that this claim is pure fantasy--like the confusing
>association between "AIDS" and "terrorism." Certainly, both are bad for

>3. In your letter you employ a technique which is not appropriate for the

>
