And any insurance company with a whit of sense would charge you rates so
high that your much touted small vendors and many of the medium sized
vendors currently in business would not exist. You think governments are
bad? Wait till you see a bunch of bean counters racing a profit margin. In
such a situation we wouldn't even have the opportunity for input into the
system via constitutions, charters, and votes. Just imagine how much support
a Japanese insurance company would provide its clients in regards to the
current epidemic in Japan, absolutely none because it is better the little
vendor go out of business than the insurance company.

I own 2 businesses (CyberTects & Linux System Development Labs) and work for
another (Tivoli - IBM), none are equivalent to my person. Businesses are a
system of rules and procedures that one offers another person in exchange for
some other commodity. Saying a business has the same rights as a person is
equivalent to saying the Empire State Bldg. has civil rights because persons 
built it and occupy it. My dog has a better argument for civil rights than
any business, it breaths and shits. Would you seriously give my dog a vote?
I shure won't, and I won't support any business with rights.
