If I remember some earlier discussion about that case from a few years
ago, the file was called "diary.pgp".

What they don't mention is that they were still able to convict him.
They were just under the belief that they could figure out who all the
victims were they didn't know about from his alleged diary... so they
could "help" the other victims or maybe get him ore jail time?

Odd thing is he used PGP 1.0, which used Bass-O-Matic.

Yes. This is quite common in political/social discussions and
argumentation.  A big problem is that people are no longer taught
rhetoric and argumentation in schools.  Another problem is that it
is a clear example the opponents of strong crypto can point to, with
lots of emotional strings attached.  The best you can do is to note
that the case in question was still sucessfully prosecuted, and also
to give counter-examples as to why PGP has helped people (cite the
usual freedom fighters in Burma, Amnesty International examples, or
cite the theft of records from the UN's investigation in Bosnia, noting
that it wasn't encrypted....)
