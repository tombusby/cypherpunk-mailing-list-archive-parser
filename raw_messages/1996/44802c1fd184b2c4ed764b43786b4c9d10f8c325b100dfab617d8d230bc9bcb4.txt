I've proposed that if it were done in this way, the circuit should be built 
external to a PC-clone or other computer, so that it can be easily tiled on 
a large pcb, in an "n by m" array.  The reason is that if an individual 
cracker module were as simple and cheap as it should be, a person could 
easily want to run dozens if not hundreds of them. Communication would 
probably be done with a single serial data bus, with each module 
individually addressed.  Due to the nature of the DES crack, communication 
would be rare, so it's likely that an ordinary '386 or '486-based computer 
could handle all the communication for a large number of such modules.

 I don't know if the figure of $10 thrown around for an FPGA is accurate, 
but if it is then a cost of $30 for each subsystem is probably doable, 
including pc board, assembly, and a few other components.   A cost of $3000 
for a 10-by-10 array seems reasonable to me, particularly since the 
throughput of each of those FPGA's ought to be at least 10x that of a 
general-purpose PC in this application.
