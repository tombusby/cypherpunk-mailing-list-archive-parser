The electronic Telegraph is an electronic version of the British daily,
the Telegraph. I actually went through the bother of filling out their
online registration a few months ago.

The `headline' of today's edition is an article on PICS, the Platform for
Internet Content Selection, boosting it as a method for screening [actually,
they use the term `policing'] content on the internet.

Feel free to use the above url for reading the one article. I'm somewhat
undecided on whether i think it would be good idea for several folks to
be using my identity to read et--it obfuscates any tracking of my reading
habits they may be doing--so i'll just ask folks to not tell me if they do.
