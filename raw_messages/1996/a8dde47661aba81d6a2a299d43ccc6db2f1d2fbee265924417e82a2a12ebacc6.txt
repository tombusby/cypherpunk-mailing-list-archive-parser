Hey, give The Big Phone Company a break - they did just stop pushing
Lotus Notes (I don't remember if they were providing the latest
espionage-enabled verstion or just the one previous to it.)
Of course, their decision wasn't based on Lotus's selection of GAK;
it was more related to their success in selling this high-mainenance service,
which may also be related to Lotus's decision to try to increase their
foreign market......
