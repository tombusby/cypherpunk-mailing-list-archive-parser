I can give you the benefit of some experience I have had with optical data
transmission systems.  We used IR lasers to span an approximately 800 meter
distance between buildings, and the results were dreadful.  Never again!
Fog took the system down completely, on a regular basis here in New Jersey,
as did even moderate snow.  Rain was much less of a problem, surprisingly,
even heavy rain rarely did more than raise the retransmission rate and lower
throughput somewhat.  Further, the beams were very narrow, and over that
distance minute changes in transmitter orientation would cause the link to
go down.  I am talking about changes due to expansion and contraction of
metal mountings with temperature, for instance.  Mounting direct to masonry
would probably have helped a lot.  Then, there are the things like trees
growing into the path over the course of the summer, telephone cables
swinging into it intermittently in high winds, etc.  Shorter paths allow
greater control over environment, certainly, but I would be very careful
about deploying large numbers of these types of systems.  Spread spectrum
microwave radio is a great improvement, but nothing seems to beat properly
installed glass fiber for reliability.
