"When the security of the community is threatened by the freedom of the
individual?!"

By the way government serves best when it serves least.

Remember that.

No there is a major difference, I feel society is served best when
each individual has the freedom to defend and protect themselves apposed
to what you want us to do in essence you want us to lay down those liberties 
to an outsied group who are supposed to protect us.  

The internet is not a city, it is a computer network that
spans the globe.  What you are asking for in analogy is not a cop walking
a city street but fucking U.N. tanks driving through neiborhoods enforcing
rights by way of brute force. 

>From what I have seen of what your group does you are as hypicritical as
law enforcement in your techniques and attacks on others.  Often unwarranted
and justified in the name of some supposed higher ideal.

PGP encrypted mail preferred.
