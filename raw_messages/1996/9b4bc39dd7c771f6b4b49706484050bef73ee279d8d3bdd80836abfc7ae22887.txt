???  Your third sentence doesn't make any sense.  While I agree with your 
position, why would it *possibly* be a crime to interefere with felonious 
communcations?  The lanuguage is lamentably unambiguous about the
fact that it is the obstruction and not the information that is
in furtherance of a felony...

It is quite conceivable that an unsuccessful attempt to obstruct
justice might cause additional trouble, time, and expense to the
guys in the white hats.  Note that the language does not distinguish
between successful and unsuccessful attempts...though you're right
that it seems that only unsuccessful attempts could be verified...
the rest is clouded by your assumption that the information, rather
than the obstruction, must be in furtherance of the crime...

Probably.  That's what the word "willful" is doing in there.   Read
carefully:  it's willful obstruction, not willful encryption...

I am not a lawyer, although I play one on the net.

I agree with your position, but you're not reading as closely 
as the enemy will...
