Pity; I thought them kits came with a Free Modem Trial Offer! ROTFL! :-)

Seriously, of course...
You have a point there, but... who will educate our educators?
-(if part of this "education" hinders and discourages our Liberty)?

Even Worse! Some dictatorships, as you know, use this type of murder
continually... Even democracies in fact, if we remember JF KEnnedy et.al.

In a _philosophical_ sense, such acts of violence are indeed censorship,
(in the wider sense) of the most brutal kind.
Of course, I agree that in a _dictionary_ sense, you are mostly right...

HOWEVER: It is part our DUTY as Free Men to OVERCOME a serious FALLACY of
most EDUCATION: equating Wider Truths with Narrow Dictionary Definitions.

- I would call these Truths "broader" but I wouldn't like the joke about
  Open Minds liking... Wide Broads!  (Ever heard it?)  ROTFL!!! :-)

There is no difference. Aga is a great guy who in a moment of nationalistic
misunderstanding, called me a number of bad names. And so did I. These are
what you call "actions". They are completely harmless. I am more concerned
about the... flies sitting on the surface of my monitor, hindering my eyes.

So-called "unacceptable" (speech-)acts are less dangerous than FLIES!
:-)
