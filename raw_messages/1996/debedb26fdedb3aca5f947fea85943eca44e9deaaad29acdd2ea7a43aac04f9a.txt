I can see a case where one would want to broadcast a message (say on usenet)
with *no* indication of the intended recipient (not even a non registered
key-id).  It would seem to be easy enough to hack up something that does not
have key-IDs - to know if it's for you try decryption and if it works then
it was for you.  This does not scale well as the recipient must trial
decrypt all messages which could use *a lot* (tm) of CPU time.
