This may be off topic or then again it may not be.

A friend paid his balance and cancelled his Nations Bank Visa card 
about 6 months ago.  A couple of days ago, he received a bill from
Nations Bank for a *recent* charge, which the indicated vendor denies 
submitting.

My friend has been trying for two days to get through to Nations Bank
on its customer service line, to no avail.  He keeps getting a "due to
heavy calling volume our queue is full" message.

Anybody know who screwed up how?
