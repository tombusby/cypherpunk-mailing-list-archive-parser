   AmBank, July 29, 1996: 
 
      Technologists at banks with large overseas operations 
      have drawn encouragement from a National Research 
      Council report suggesting that businesses be allowed 
      stronger forms of data encryption. Although financial 
      transactions are generally exempt from encryption 
      restrictions, bankers advocate more freedom in the 
      market. They complain that government officials often 
      refuse their requests for international use of 
      applications with strong cryptography -- and give no 
      reasons for their decisions. 
 
 
   NiSaShi, July 23, 1996: 
 
      Japan ID Tech, an Osaka-based information technology 
      startup, has developed a system for encoding text as 
      graphical images that can be sent via fax over normal 
      communications transmission lines. The system consists 
      of software that converts text to a two-dimensional bar 
      code called a CP code, which is gaining popularity as a 
      next-generation coding system. The company's encoding 
      program also incorporates DES.
