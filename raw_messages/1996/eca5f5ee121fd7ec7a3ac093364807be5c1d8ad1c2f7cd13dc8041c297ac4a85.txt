I didn't call for your "expulsion." No one has been expelled in four years
of the list's existence.

However, when people complain about not being interested in the list
topics, and refers to some of the main list topics as "conjuring up the
latest utopia for a
minoritarian sect of illuminati," then, yes, I would say this is insulting,
or, at least, dismissive.

As with a restaurant, if people complain loudly about the food, they ought
to leave and not come back. This is not the restaurant expelling them, this
is just them acting on their opinions.
