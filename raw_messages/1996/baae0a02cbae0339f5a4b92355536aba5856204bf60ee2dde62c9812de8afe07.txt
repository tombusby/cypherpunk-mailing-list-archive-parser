No, I meant the ENTIRE government  Not just individual government officials. 
 Remember, RICO is _supposed_ to apply to any organization with a pattern of 
criminal activity, and has been used (in fact, probably mostly used) against 
organizations where many of the members are "merely" employees, quite 
analogous to the Federal government.  If RICO applies to anything, it should 
apply to the Feds, and that means conviction of the entire organization if 
it or its employees have a pattern of illegal activity.   Since RICO only 
requires a relatively tiny number of criminal acts to meet its standards, it 
should not be difficult to show enough criminality.
