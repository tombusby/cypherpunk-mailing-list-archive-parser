Yes he is.  They are poor and it is all their fault.

[flame-bait approaching...]

There are two kinds of libertarians, those who hate the poor and those who
don't.  I always seem to meet the former, I am beginning to suspect the
latter don't exist.

Yes, he is.  It is times like this that I must count myself among the
pitchfork and torch wielding mob, if only because I have been cursed
with a small amount of compassion for those who were not as lucky as I.

BTW Mr. Avon, the reason we, the unruly mob of collectivists, socialists, and
[insert libertarian/anarchist buzzword here] should stick a gun in your
back and make you cough up money for education is because we can.  If you
don't want to do so, they why don't _you_ move?  Are your feet cast in
concrete blocks?

Welcome to the real world.
