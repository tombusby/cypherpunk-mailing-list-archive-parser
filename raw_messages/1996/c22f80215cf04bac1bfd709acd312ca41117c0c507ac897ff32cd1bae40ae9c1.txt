Does the bill define "privacy" explicitly? Or is it defined clearly 
anywhere else in California law? That can be a real problem... (the US 
Supreme Court seems to limit 'privacy' to what goes on in bed between a 
married heterosexual couple, for instance.)

What is unauthorized use?  Is it still acceptable to collect information 
on someone?  Is a person given the right to know who is tracking them, 
and what someone else or a corporation has about them?

What counts as written consent? Checking a "Yes, you may send my name to 
interested advertisers so I can receive lots of junk mail to burn in my 
stove to keep warm in the winter" box?  And once a person has checked off 
on it, is it ok for a corporation to redistribute that info without 
asking permission (since it's already been signed off), of must that 
third party again ask permission?
