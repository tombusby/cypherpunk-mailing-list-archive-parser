No, I am not jdoe-0007. 
 
We satanic-socialist-statists all use preliminary trial copies of JOHN-DOE
set to jdoe-666. 
 
It is in our contract with the Sales Rep of Darkness and we are widely
known for always respecting contracts. 
 
Look out UNIX users! With JOHN-DOE us WINDOZE users under the leadership of
our glorius Chairman Bill are gonna' get the rest of your body too! 
 
(Unlike jdoe-0007 I think $25 is a very low price to pay for the new
capacity. What the hell! We're not gonna' pay for it out of our own lazy
pockets. We'll raise the tax on hot tubs and get other people to buy it for
us.)
