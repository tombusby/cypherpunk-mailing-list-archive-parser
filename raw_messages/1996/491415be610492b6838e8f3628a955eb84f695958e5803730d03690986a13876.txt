Which should remind us...  While the costs are going up, so far undetermined 
is the "benefits" that are supposed to accrue from this bugging ability.   
How many crimes, approximately, are going to be solved or prevented by the 
expenditure of this $2 billion dollars?  One hundred?  A thousand?  Even if 
it were 10,000, that would still be $200,000 per crime.  Is there no cheaper 
way to prevent those crimes?

And, moreover, do we REALLY want to prevent those "crimes"?   If they are 
attacks on an illegitimate government that is violating our rights, as far 
as I can see we want to see those "crimes" succeed, not fail.

Let's put their feet to the fire:  They should be required to show a 
reasonable estimate of the benefits as well as an apparently phony initial 
estimate of the costs.  If they respond that they can't estimate the 
benefits, then why do they want us to incur the costs.

However, the real answer is even simpler.
