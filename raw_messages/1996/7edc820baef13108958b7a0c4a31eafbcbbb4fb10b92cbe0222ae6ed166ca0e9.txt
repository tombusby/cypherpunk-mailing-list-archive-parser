I think the druggies call this a "rat line": two apartments next to each
other, with the humans living in one and the drugs stored in the other. The
drugs are gotten through a hole in the wall.

(Hey, I'm not saying it works, or that it stops raids, prosecutions,
convictions, etc. Just noting the existence.)

Any multi-unit apartment can do this already, with data. The hard disk can
be upstairs and two units away, connected with Ethernet (as many apartment
buildings out here in California already are), or whatever. Any raid on
Unit 3B, for example, finds that no files are stored locally. A separate
investigation and/or search warrant for whereever the files actually are
stored would be of course problematic and/or delayed.

(Friends of mine have worked on "remote storage" ideas for exactly such
applications. Clearly there are many options: storage in other local sites,
storage in offshore sites, encrypted storage, even storage by a "priest"
functionary ("Son, I am ready to receive your digitally transmitted
confession.").)

Lots of possibilities. For various reasons, few have been pursued. (Mostly
because, I think, there have been relatively few raids on data, and when
there have been raids, there were usually other HUMINT-type factors
involved. E.g., few child porn rings are going to be broken only on the
basis of seized disks. As this situation changes, expect more "data
archival" services to evolve.)
