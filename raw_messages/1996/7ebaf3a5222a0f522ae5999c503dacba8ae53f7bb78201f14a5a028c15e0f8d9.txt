I was there 2 years ago. The Red Cross is about the only group you can count
on other than family, friends and a church (if you happen to belong to one).

Getting another drivers license was a easy operation. Head down to the local
DPS office and request a replacement card for a lost license. The titles and
such for property and auto were tedious but not impossible. I didn't need to
show anything other than my drivers license and pay the requisite fees to
obtain new copies of the deeds. In general the governmental types of
documents and such were easy to replace. I personaly had all the necessary
copies of the documents I needed within a month or so. The personal items
were impossible to replace and caused the most emotional turmoil.

In many parts of the country the Red Cross is delepeted both in operating
funds and volunteers. If you can, please consider giving them your support.
I personaly didn't use them but both my roomies did.
