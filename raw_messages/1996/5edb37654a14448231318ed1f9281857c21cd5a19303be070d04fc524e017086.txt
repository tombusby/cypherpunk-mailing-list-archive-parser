No, Adam, I certainly was not implying you are profiting from this in any
way. Maybe the "make.money.fast" description was a poor one...what I meant
to imply is that the book is being advertised widely (I've seen half a
dozen announcements of it), and it reminds me of either the Craig Shergold
or make.money.fast posts, not sure which.

The main technology, "the truth machine," is so bogus as to be boring.

We agree. I once jokingly wrote a post about "position escrow," and I now
fear it is not so far off. ("The Positional Update Tracking Zoner (PUTZ)
meets law enforcement's legitimate needs, with proper court authority, to
track the movements of citizen-units.")

However, what you say below about being required to explain your movements
to cops who stop you on the highway and then present "papers" to them
within one week is truly horrifying, far beyond anything we yet have here
in these beknighted states:
