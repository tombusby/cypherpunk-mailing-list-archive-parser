You are producing a permutation table.  Repeat passes just get you
a new table, no different in principle.

But the internet worm of 1988 was captured, decompiled and analysed in days.
Self-modifying viruses get analysed (by single stepping).  Your programs will
go the same way as soon as there is (financial ?) motivation.

So the users have to know the algorithms, including "tweaks" in order
to communicate ?  Not the most convenient key.

>From this known plaintext-cyphertext pair the enemy can list
all the possible sources and destinations of each bit.

EG  first bit of plaintext (position 0, value 1) can move to 1,3,4,5,....,199
   second bit of plaintext (position 1, value 1) can move to 1,3,4,5,....,199

Given a number of pairs of the same length, produced with the
same key details each of these lists of possibilities shrinks
by around half.  Your 12kb file is well on the way to being
cracked after 4+10+3=17 pairs are discovered.

If the intention is never to reuse keys, then this scheme gets
you nothing you couldn't have with a normal stream cipher.
And they, don't reveal the number of 1-bits and 0-bits in the
message.  Different messages will be recognisable different.

A chosen plaintext attack (where these are possible) becomes a breeze.

How are the above remarks invalidated ?

I don't want to stifle creativity.  If you keep thinking you may
come up with a good idea.  But this isn't it.

I encourage you to read about existing systems.  There have been
bright people before, and things are done (or not done) for a reason.
