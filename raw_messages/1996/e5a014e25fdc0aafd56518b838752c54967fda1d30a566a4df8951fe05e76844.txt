I volunteer my 120 MHZ Pentium.  A lot more Pentiums are out there now than
a year ago.  That makes it more feasible.  A lot more people with full net
connections.  Like most Americans, I have a flat rate net connection and a
flat rate local phone connection so could run a cracking session permanently
(as long as no one tells my ISP).  We need a full test of the Winsock
cracking client in any case.  It wasn't working very well last time.
