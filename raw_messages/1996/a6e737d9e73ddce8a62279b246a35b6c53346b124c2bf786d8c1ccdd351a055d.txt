I haven't heard of any efficient cryptanalysis against Blowfish.  I know there
are weak keys, but they are difficult to exploit.  16 round Blowfish can be
broken using differential cryptanalysis with 2^128+1 chosen plaintexts.

Blowfish is unpatented, free for commercial use, and very fast so I don't see
how the use of Blowfish could be considered stupid.  IDEA and triple-DES may
be more secure, but I think that they are too slow for voice communication.
