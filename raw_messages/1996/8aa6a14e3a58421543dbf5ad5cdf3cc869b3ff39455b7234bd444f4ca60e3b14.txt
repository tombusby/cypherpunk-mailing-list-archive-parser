Please be advised that the PUC is not responsible for enforcing the
technical standards overall, that is the FCC. It is responsible for setting
rates and resolving problems with customers on specific problems.

The letter I received from SWBT is as follows:

Dear Customer:

On November 17, 1995, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (SWBT) filed an
application (assigned Tariff Control No. 15024) concerning its ISDN-based
services, as required by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (Commission)
Substantive Rule (SR) 23.69 Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). ISDN
is a digital network architecture that provides a wide variety of services,
a standard set of user-network messages, and integrated access to the
network. Access methods to the ISDN are the Basic Rate Interface (BRI) and
the Primary Rate Interface (PRI).

This application does not increase the currently approved rates or optional
ISDN based services (i.e. SWBT's DigiLine(sm), SmartTrunk(sm), SelectVideo
Plus(sm) and PLEXAR(sm) ISDN services) and their features.

SR 23.69 sets forth the requirements for the provision of optional
ISDN-based services. In accordance with SR 23.69, at a minimum, ISDN-based
services shall comply with National ISDN-1 and National ISDN-2 Standards and
be capable of providing end-to-end digital connectivity. SWBT's application
includes the offering  of ISDN with PLEXAR(sm) II Service and new features
to DigiLine(sm) and SmartTrunk(sm) Services to meet the standards required
to meet standards required by SR 23.69. Also, SBWT is proposing in this
application to eliminate the minimum station requirement for PLEXAR II(sm)
Service and the offering of occassional user plan for DigiLine(sm) Service
to future customers. In addition, SR 23.69 requires SWBT to make ISDN-based
services available to all its exchanges in Texas by July 1, 1996. SWBT is
currently offering ISDN-based services in its exchanges comprised in the
Abilene, Amarillo, Austin, Brownsville, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, Lubbock
and San Antonio LATAs. In compliance with the rule, SWBT will make
ISDN-based services available in its remaining exchanges comprised in the
Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Hearne, Longview, Midland, Waco, and Wichita Falls
LATAs by July 1, 1996. SR 23.69 also establishes the effective date of this
application to be no later than July 1, 1996. The new optional ISDN-based
service and features are expected to generate first year net revenues of
approximately $372,000.

Persons who wish to comment on this application should notify the Commission
by January 12, 1996. Requests for further information should be mailed
(faxed material is not acceptable for filling) to the Public Utility
Commission of Texas, 7800 Shoal Creek Blvd., Austin, Texas 78757, or you may
call the Public Utility Commission Public Information Office at 512-458-0256
or 512-458-0221 for text telephone.
