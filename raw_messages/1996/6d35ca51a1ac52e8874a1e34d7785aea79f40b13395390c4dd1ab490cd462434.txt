Microsloth has, at the heart of it's system, a call which traps ALL
KEYSTROKES and EVENTS.  This call exists from Win32s on, and can be
placed inside of a DLL which most users would have no idea was loaded.
Even under NT, this DLL can be made to remain resident and trapping
Keystrokes, events, and window contents.

Does this just BEG to be exploited?

If you give me normal user access to ANY microsloth machine, I can
have most of the system's security broken down to NOTHING within a
week.  And I'm not even a good MS programmer!  <Are my prejudices
showing?>

At least under UNIX, you damned well know you have to secure your
system.  Microsloth attempts to sell itself as a secure platform.
