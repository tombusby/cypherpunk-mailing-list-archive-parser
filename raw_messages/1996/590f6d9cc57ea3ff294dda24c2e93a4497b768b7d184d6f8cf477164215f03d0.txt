Terrorists are people who create terror by random murder, by killing the
innocent:  Clearly this is the exact opposite of what Jim Bell advocates.

The word terrorist was originally applied primarily to government organizations
of terror, most notably the french revolution.  You seem to be using the word
"terror" to mean  "Non government use of force"  So by your definition, 
George Washington was a terrorist, whereas the Stalin and the French 
Revolutionary tribunal were not terrorists.

By your definition of terrorist, there are plenty of advocates of "terrorism"
on this mailing list.

or possibly you need to comprehend the difference between governmental decrees
and morality.
