Not much info in the article. It wasn't the central focus... 
actually, the article dealt with the political cynicism of the new 
measures.

More from the article (all that really mentions the bill at all):

    The cyberspace bill, passed by the Senate last week, could make it 
  a felony to have sexually explicit communication with a minor through 
  a computer network, especially if the communication included pictures 
  of sexual activity or an invitation to have sex.

Which doesn't say much about the bills content.  Technically this is 
already illegal, so why pass a cybespce-specific bill? What are the 
responsibilities of publishers, ISPs, SysAdmins, etc.?  What if a 
minor pretentds not to be a minor?

IMO, It sounds like another meaningless bill that looks good on
political mailings...

What's the NYS gopher address again?
