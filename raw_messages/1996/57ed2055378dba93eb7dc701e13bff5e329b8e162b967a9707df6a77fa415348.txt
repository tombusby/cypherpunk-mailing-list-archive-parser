It has been. In many hundreds of articles addressing aspects of the issue.

The fact that Esther Dyson and others think advocates of the right to be
anonymous claim that these issues are not being considered just shows that
Esther and others are not aware of these many articles.

Nor can every brief post--such as the one James Donald made above--include
a fully-nuanced, fully-balanced discussion of all issues. Saying that an
advocate for a position has not considered the alternate positions is
usually incorrect.
