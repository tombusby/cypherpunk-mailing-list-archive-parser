yes, that's exactly the case.  I wouldn't call it the virtual machine
security, though, but the application security, since the applet
restrictions are enforced at the application level by the SecurityManager.
(the browser is the application in this case) 

Whether or not this is a problem depends on the quality of implementation
of the DLL, and whether or not you care about this level of insecurity,
given that the browser and other software runing on the machine
may or may not be secure.   People routinely "click here" to download
and install some plug-in, so probably those folks are willing to place
their bets and take their chances.  

Note that in all this I'm not claiming that the Java setup as
currently implemented is without bugs.  I'm just talking about the model. 

As far as the Java applet sandbox goes, I think we can do a better job of
specifying a minimal TCB and enforcing the applet restrictions at the
application level.   There are people who think that the sandbox model
itself is not do-able.  I think reasonable people can disagree on that
point.

If there's a market for security, then vendors will respond to that. 
I think it's interesting that the internet might provide that
market demand.    Other people on this list who have worked on 
secure products can probably testify as to whether or not customers
were willing to wait longer and pay more for higher quality, more
secure software, or if they're more interested in buying something today
that provides some needed feature.    I'm not saying this is good
or bad - I'm just observing that market forces are real.    Another
way of saying this is, perhaps software that previously was only
deployed in special-purpose applications will move into consumer
mainstream.
