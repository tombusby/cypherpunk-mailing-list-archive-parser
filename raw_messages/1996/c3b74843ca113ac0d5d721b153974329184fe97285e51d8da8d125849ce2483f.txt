It's probably close enough for anti-government work; the relative strength
depends a lot on whether you're using general-purpose computers or
custom crackerboxes, and on the state of the art in factoring technologies.
I'd be tempted to be verbose and say that public-key systems like RSA
use prime numbers for keys, so they need to be a lot longer than
secret-key algorithms like DES or RC4 which can use any number as a key but
need to keep it secret.  You can double the cracking effort by adding
one bit to a secret key or about 10 to a public key. 
500-bit public keys and 56-bit secret keys are about the limit of cracking 
technology for organizations with a couple of million dollars spare for
supercomputers, which is your desktop in 5-10 years.

The NSA's Clipper Chip used 80-bit keys, which is about 20 years' protection
against people who can't use the built-in wiretap or bribe a cop to
get a warrant.  One problem with these secret hardware designs is that you 
usually can't tell if there's a back-door unless they tell you - or goof up
like they did with the Clipper's short checksum.
