The fact that you are willing to include the name "Unicorn" in that 
"flamefest" should hold a clue as to the source of the problem.

I do, however, promote one of the most controversial ideas you've probably 
ever seen discussed on the computer networks.  You might well imagine that 
doing so would tend to attract people who are like moths attracted to a 
flame.  Thus, a "flamewar."  Notice that Unicorn tries to flame me on 
practically every subject he can, which should be another clue as to his 
motivations.

If you've ever had a controversial work published in a mass-media outlet 
(and the Internet is turning into just such a thing) you'll notice that 
you'll get unsolicited letters from people, some of whom aren't quite "all 
there", and  people who obviously have their own ax to grind.  Often both. 
(I had a guest editorial published in the Portland Oregonian newspaper about 
six years ago, so I speak from experience.)  Usually that ends quickly; 
people have short memories and are distracted by newer events.  In the 
computer network area, however, the opportunity for follow-ups is ever-present.

That's why I'm not surprised about people like Unicorn.  It would probably 
be excessive to say "he's crazed," but he clearly spends an unusual amount 
of effort.  Check out the CP archives a few days ago; I did an experiment, 
choosing to not to respond to nearly all of his notes.  He kept writing!

>It is also interesting to note that Mr. Unicorn talks knowledgably about

Quite the contrary:  While my degree is in Chemistry, most particularly 
Organic Chemistry (but also Physical chemistry, solid-state chemistry, and 
inorganic chemistry), I am rather knowledgeable about physics (including 
nuclear, high-energy, semiconductor, astrophysics, etc), electronics (analog and digital; 
I was frequently mistaken for a EE student during my college years), optics, 
computer hardware, a smattering of computer software, radio (I'm a ham) and 
a few other fields. 

This, however, is the "Cypherpunks" area, and with the exception of some 
bomb-trigger discussions a few weeks ago, much of that knowledge isn't 
commonly shown in the majority of the discussions here.  It's odd, 
therefore, that you would suggest that I "talk about one field," as if that 
was somehow my limit.  If anything, it shows that I (at least in your eyes) 
pay more attention to the subject of the list than Unicorn.

If you really want to start talking about some of these other fields, I'd be 
happy to, but I don't think that would improve  the specificity of the list. 
Other people might object, as well.  We go on enough tangents as it is.

This sounds like a conspiracy theory.  I don't have any "associates."  And I 
have never posted on any list, echo, USENET group, or bbs under an alias, 
and I am posting with my real name.  I'm listed in the phone directory for Vancouver, 
Washington, and I've never had an unlisted telephone number.

Until Unicorn is willing to identify himself with the same amount of 
verifiable detail, it is in his direction you should look for conspiracies.

What, exactly, is your definition of a "useful contribution"?

Somebody ( I don't recall who) once opined to me that Unicorn behaves toward 
me somewhat like Detweiler behaved towards Tim May.  I probably missed most 
of that, but I can see the similaries.  This doesn't make him Detweiler, but 
it suggests that his motivations are similar.


One last thing:  On re-reading your note, I noticed that your writing style 
is rather... how shall I say... familiar.  Care to discuss how you did it?  
Did you use a program?
