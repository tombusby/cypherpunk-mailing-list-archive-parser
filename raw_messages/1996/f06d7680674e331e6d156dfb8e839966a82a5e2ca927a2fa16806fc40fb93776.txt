Most heterosexual men claim to like women, but the claim is dubious on
the part of a large percentage of men, since they really like to mostly
do "boy things", i.e., follow sports, ride motorcycles, listen to "boy
music", etc., rather than hang out with women as just friends.

I think if people were really honest, they'd admit that, by and large,
men like men and women like women.  Simple enough, eh?
