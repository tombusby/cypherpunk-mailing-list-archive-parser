Gobbledygook.  Blaming the problems of the system on the people involved.
It is obvious that you are unwilling to admit that THE SYSTEM could, indeed,
BE the problem.

More gobbledygook.  Blaming the problem on the observers of the problem.

Still more gobbledygook.  You don't mention  WHICH "stark biases and
prejudices," for instance.

"Vaporware" is generally thought of as programs that have not yet been
implemented.  While it is true that much of what libertarians have proposed
has not yet been implemented, blame for this lies strongly (and primarily)
with NON-libertarians.

You haven't established this, and haven't even attempted to.  Your
argumentation is weak and practically meaningless.


>rabid libertarianism reminds me of Marxism: sounds great in theory,

Lots of things "sound great in theory".   That does not mean that everything
that "sounds great in theory" will NOT be good in practice, if allowed to
operate.  This is ESPECIALLY true that much of libertarianism which "sounds
great in theory" actually sounds PERFECTLY AWFUL to the statists who
currently control things.

First, you tell us:  What are your standards for  this?  Are you never going
to admit that it's "workable" until it's actually working?  In other words,
when those opposing it have finally FAILED?

where are the specifics?

"Specific" what?


>identifying problems with government is quite trivial.

If you admit this is the case, this puts even more blame on those defending
government's flaws (or failure to fix them.)

 >this is destructive
>criticism, 

Please document this silly claim.  You're saying identify problems with
government is "destructive"?  "Destructive" of what, pray tell?!?    If it's
"destructive" of a bad and corrcupt government, I'm HAPPY to hear it.   This
kind of "destructive" we need PLENTY more of!


?analogous to the guerilla warfare of words that rabid libertarians
>love. but criticism is easy compared to construction of something that works.

Oddly, the non-libertarians don't usually want to give libertarians the
opportunity to take enough control to show that what they can do "works."
Gee, I wonder why!  Maybe they're afraid of incipient success.
Privatization of previously publicly-provided services is strongly resisted.

More gobbledygook.

It is, and does, work on small scales, WHEN ALLOWED.

>what prevents individuals from actually starting it going

It's called, "government regulation," "taxes," and such.  If you've been
following the news recently, perhaps you've noticed that there are "peanut
quotas" (to cite just one example) which legally prevent me from deciding to
grow peanuts and sell them freely on the American market.  ___THIS___ is
just one of those things which "prevents individuals from actually starting
it going at a small scale and growing it."

Feeling a bit more foolish, Mr. Nuri?!?

That's EXACTLY why libertarianism ISN'T being allowed to flourish.  It
eliminates control that others worked hard to achieve.

Typical Nuri wimp-out.
