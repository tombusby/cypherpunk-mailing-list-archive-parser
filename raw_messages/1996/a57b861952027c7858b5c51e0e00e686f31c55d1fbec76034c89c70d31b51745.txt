This Thursday!!!

San Diego Area CPUNKS symposium  Thursday, Nov. 7, 1996.

   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at "The Mission
Cafe & Coffee Shop".  We discuss cryptography and other related subjects, have
the special cypherpunk dinner, and unwind after a long day at the grind stone.

   Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint.  If you can figure out
how to get it on the back of a business card, that would be cool.  If you want
the suspicious crowd there to sign your key, bring two forms of ID.

   Michelle is going to bring her PGP fingerprint in for signature.  Can you
believe it?

   Hopefully Lance Cottrell will give us an update on Mixmaster and what's
going on at San Diego's best ISP.  

   This will probably be the last symposium of the year since December is
normally quite crazzzzy.  
   
Place: The Mission Cafe & Coffee Shop
       3795 Mission Bl in Mission Beach.
       488-9060


Time:1800

Their Directions:
	8 west to Mission Beach Ingram Exit
	Take west mission bay drive
	Go right on Mission Blvd.

	On the corner of San Jose and mission blvd.
	It is located between roller coaster and garnett.
	It's kind of 40s looking building...  funky looking 
        (their description, not mine)

They serve stuff to eat, coffee stuff, and beer + wine stuff.

See you there!

New guy, bring your fingerprint.

Drop me a note if you plan to attend...

that you may have for me.  I am currently not subscribed to the CP list since
my current internet connection is slow (I'm waiting for my ISDN connection. :)
