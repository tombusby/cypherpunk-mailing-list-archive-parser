I heard that Bruce Schneier has devised a cryptosystem based on a card
deck for a future book by Neal Stephenson.  It is supposed to be simple
enough for a person to use manually, but complicated enough that it can't
be broken by computer.  Your idea of using cards as a one time pad is
somewhat similar, maybe, although I think Bruce's was designed to be
useful for long messages, providing computational rather than unconditional
security.

This is very interesting; I've never seen this algorithm before.  It
is a nice way to turn a number into a permutation, and vice versa.

This would be 4*4! + 2*3! + 1*2! + 1(was 3)*1! + 0*0!, or as you say:
