No, my post wasn't about Nazis, it was about the principle behind
an act attributed to the Danish King.  It was offered as an 
illustration to help explain why I was making my Modest Proposal.
Whether or not the story is a lie is irrelevant.  It was offered 
for its allogorical value.  Get a grip.

Thanks to the Cypherpunks who have signed up for the LIST OF SHAME
publicly or by private e-mail.  I will post the list soon.  I urge
anyone else who would like to be on Mr/Ms Anonymous' (Detwieler's,
Jim Bell's) LIST OF SHAME to let me know as soon as possible so 
you can be included.

I think to be fair, I should also take applications for inclusion
in a list called SUPPORTERS OF MR/MS ANONYMOUS, for those who
think he's right.

This is NOT an election, democratic vote or even a popularity
contest.  But Anonymous has made a lot of noise purportedly
speaking as and for Cypherpunks.  I'd like to see where the
consensus more truely lies on this mailing list.  Let me know.
