One of these days Microsoft will officially release NT's IFS SDK. A few
"preliminary" and incomplete copies of a 1993 beta release do float around
but for a mere $50K there's a company that will sell you the complete source
for an IFS. It's a crime that Microsoft hasn't shipped this SDK yet as the
Installable File System is one of the great powers of NT.

So, if someone is interested in coughing up the $50K I know a couple NT
programmers just chomping at the bit to build cool IFS's like PGPDrive, etc.
