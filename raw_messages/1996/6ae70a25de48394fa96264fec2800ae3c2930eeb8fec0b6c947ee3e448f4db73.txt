This was on the national TV news tonight as well.  I'm still trying to
figure out what planet all these people are from.  Boys and bombs have gone
together at least since i was a boy.  Teenage boys were building pipe bombs
back when i was a teenager, in the seventies, before anyone had heard of
personal computers or the internet.  Of course, i didn't learn about bombs
for blowing up entire buildings until much later, when some television show
mentioned combining diesel fuel with  fertilizer.  This show even got
specific as to the type of fertilizer, but i forgot to take notes.

The only counter-argument than makes any sense to me is that this isn't
new.  Boys have been building bombs for years.  Now they get their
information from the internet instead of the library or older kids down the
street.  The information has always been available.

Of course, there is always the argument about parental responsibility, but
that's not as sexy as the evil internet.
