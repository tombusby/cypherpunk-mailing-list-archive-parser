You are your child's seat belt for the internet.  There are plenty of tools
at your disposal that do not require govt. intervention.  As for the
television, I'm sure you already have my email on that.  I also don't have
problems with eviornmental regulations, labor codes, electronic safety
standards for computers and such even though those cost me money as well.
All of those laws, however, do not restrict my freedom of speech.  If not
wearing a seat is your idea of free speech, I personally can't vouch for
your intelegence (I can't do that anyway:-)), but you still have the right
to speak your mind on the matter, as you are now.  People talking about gay
rights, abortion options, better sex (a la Dr. Ruth) can no longer do that
on the net without wondering whether they are in violation of the bill or
not.

I "no" no such thing.  The price of the chip has been estimated to be
higher than was stated tonight on the news, that's for sure.  (Anyone got a
figure?  I'd like to hear how much the TV makers will think it will cost.)
