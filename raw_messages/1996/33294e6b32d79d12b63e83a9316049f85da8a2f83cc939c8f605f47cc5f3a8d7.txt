There are good things to be said for "hanging out with one's own kind" -
sometimes it can facilitate getting things done, by eliminating potential
sources of friction, etc.  OTOH, this is largely a negatives issue, yes?
Looking at positive issues, one could probably find as much interesting
and enlightening in direct contact with persons of other races, religions,
and cultures (if the conflict isn't too destructive), if not more so than
with one's own, when one considers that growth and learning (essential to
good health) bring greater conflict than when one is merely comfortable.
