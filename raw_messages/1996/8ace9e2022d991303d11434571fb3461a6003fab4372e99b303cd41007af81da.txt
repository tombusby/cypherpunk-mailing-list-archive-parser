I didn't mean that I think that the govt should be allowed to control.  I
meant that govt would only be able to regulate commercial and/or public
systems.  They, of course, would have no say in the specs of my
personally-written cryptosystem.

Sorry about the confusion.  Although I may have used the two terms loosely,
I was trying to contrast commercial and public against something written in
secret and not offered for govt approval.

Absolutely not!  Let me clarify that I feel that the govt should have no
part in crypto regulation, be it commercial, public, private, business, etc.

After some responses and some thought, I have seen the error in my thinking.
Having a secret, proprietary cryptosystem would loose the public-key benefit.
It would be fine, I believe, for point-to-point communications though.
