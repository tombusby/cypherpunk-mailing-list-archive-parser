Ok fellas, I am usually against senseless arguing.  Especially over a
subject that certain individuals shouldn't even had wasted the time to reply
to if they couldn't give a sh*t about it in the first place.  Therefore, I
assume that they are arguing JUST to argue, but they wait until a topic pops
up that they have some background in, therefore standing a chance of
winning.  Well, you already lost when you assumed that something worthwhile
or useful would come of your negative responses.  Oh, excuse me; you did get
replies to your responses, so I guess your investment did turn a profit.

Well, stooping even further into your realm, I too visited my trusty search
utility, MetaCrawler.  It too found all four of your words.  I decided to
pluck five odd-looking words from my MAINLIST.TXT produced by Word-List
Builder.  The list is COMPLETELY untouched or altered by human hands.  I ran
all five of them through MetaCrawler and your DejaNews (ultra list source)
and here are the results:

Word                 MetaCrawler DejaNews
-------------------- ----------- --------
DisplayWorkstationSe 0           0
SETUPPP              0           0
TmpDirPad            0           0
dsRegSetPads         0           0
TotalSwapReqdFromINF 0           0

(These words were all found in the first 1% of my list and then I got bored.)

Logic tells me that a word that can be found ANYWHERE with a
publicly-available search utility would not be the IDEAL passphrase to lock
up my secrets.

Well, now that I know where YOU will be assembling your list from, I can
rest assured to pull one from my list instead.
