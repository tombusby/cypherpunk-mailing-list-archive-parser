        Name:  monthly Bay Area Cypherpunks meeting
        Date:  Saturday January 13
        Time:  12 p.m. - 6 p.m. 
        Spot:  Sparcy's, Building 21, Sun Microsystems
        Food:  Bagels provided; feel free to bring lunch to munch 

The agenda is still forming.  So far, there are two speakers lined up to
talk about Mark Twain ECash.   (Lucky Green and Sameer.)

It might be interesting to have general discussions of ...
	
	CompuServe, where the censorship wave is going, and
	what to do in response

	Timing attacks on RSA algorithms

	So, can we all now band together and invest in PGP, The Company?

	What's needed in crypto APIs?    What do you love or hate about
	current sets of APIs? 

	(your favorite topic here ...) 

See you tomorrow,
Marianne

p.s.

directions to Sun's B21:  Take 101 South to Amphitheater Exit.  Go to the
end of the ramp and turn left on Charleston.  This road is also known as
Garcia.  After about 1/3 mile, turn right onto the first city street on
your right.  In about 2 long blocks or so, you'll see purple signs for
Building 21 of Sun Microsystems.  The meeting is held in the cafeteria.
