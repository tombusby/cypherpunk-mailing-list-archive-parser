I have a question about legal issues:

Lets asume I have a service provider in switzerland who gives me web-space.
I publish strong cryptography there. The server itself is physically in 
USA, but my domain is something like "www.itar.ch" (a swiss web-address). 
Since there is no way for me to know where the server stands, do I violate 
the ITAR, and if so, am I realistically prosecutable?
