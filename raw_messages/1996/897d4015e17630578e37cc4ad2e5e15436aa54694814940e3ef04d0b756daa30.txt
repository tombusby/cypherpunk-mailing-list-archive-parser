I agree. I don't think it will surprise me, though, because it just ain't
gonna happen. :-)

Fascinating. Could you provide citations to these laws so that people in
this plane of reality might take a look at them? Over here, any such law
would be invalidated by R.A.V. v. St. Paul. The only exceptions are
restrictions on "fighting words" that meet the tests in Chaplinsky v. New
Hampshire and "hostile working environment" discrimination, which I assume
is what you're talking about, in some elliptical way.

 In February, John Howard opened a Ku Klux Klan museum and apparel store,
 called The Redneck Shop, in Laurens, S. Car.  Asked by a reporter what
 the reaction was by townspeople, Howard said, "The only people I've had a
 problem with, who took it as an insult and a racial situation, have been
 blacks.  I didn't know blacks here were so prejudiced."  [Louisville
