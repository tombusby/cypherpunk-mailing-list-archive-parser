For "safety" purposes (at least for the builder!) I would add that the 
threads on the pipe should be covered with a generous quantity of vaseline, 
grease, wax, or other similar material.  Otherwise, the final tighten-up 
might cause an explosion if granules of powder get stuck in the threads and 
ignite due to friction.


Evidence reduction tips:  

Discard drill bit used to make hole in pipe.  Carefully avoid leaving any 
drill shavings in work area.

Completely use/discard any extra powder/fuse not used in the bomb.  
(Chemical analysis will reveal similarity...)

When tightening the pipe/cap, shield the work with a thick layer of 
folded-up paper towel or other material, so your Vice-Grips (or other such 
wrench, or vice) don't leave "tool marks" on the pipe.  (Discard, by burning, such paper after use.)
