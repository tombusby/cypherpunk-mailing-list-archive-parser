There would seem to be serious First Amendment problems with this scheme.

If you wanted to give or withhold support, you should able to say that 
you did or didn't donate money. Besides, interest groups would always be 
able to telegraph the news of the donation -- while the public remains 
in the dark. It may be better for the public to have full disclosure.
