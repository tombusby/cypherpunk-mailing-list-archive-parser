Following is an announcement about a NIST conference on leveraging the 
distributed nature of the Internet to accomplish tasks that might be 
otherwise not feasible.  The abstract notes that this type of activity 
has 'important economic, social, and political consequences'.

This may already be old news, I was off the list for the past few days.
