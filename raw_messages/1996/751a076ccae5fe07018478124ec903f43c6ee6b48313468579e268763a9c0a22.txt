	A C2 rating means that they have some audit trail mechanism,
and some means of authentication.  Basically, you read the Orange
book, spend a few million bucks, and get a C2 rating.  Ask MS if their
rating is valid after you add an ethernet card.  (The answer is no.  A
system is certified for a particular set of hardware & software.)
