The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering
Steering Group (IESG), the bodies which oversee architecture and
standards for the Internet, are concerned by the need for increased
protection of international commercial transactions on the Internet,
and by the need to offer all Internet users an adequate degree of
privacy.  Security mechanisms being developed in the Internet
Engineering Task Force to meet these needs require and depend on the
international use of adequate cryptographic technology.  Ready access
to such technology is therefore a key factor in the future growth of
the Internet as a motor for international commerce and communication.
