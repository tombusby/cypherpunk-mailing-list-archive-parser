Hi! Im writing a paper for school on E-commerce and would like to include a
brief section on the role of Cypherpunks in E-commerce. If you would, please
email me your responses to the following questions. 

Some of these questions are broad, but please limit your response to each
question to 0-100 words. Also, I am NOT attempting to stereotype the
Cypherpunks, but am instead interested to learn whether there is a shared view
among them. THANKS! 
PS- PLEASE RESPOND TO MY EMAIL DIRECTLY by FRIDAY, 5/24/96 :

transactions?

category?
