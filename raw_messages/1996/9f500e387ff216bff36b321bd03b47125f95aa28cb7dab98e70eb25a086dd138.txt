I guess that was kind of ambigous.  What I meant was any protocal/system
where money is changing hands protected only by DES.   That's what I meant by
"like digicash".   I don't even know if such a beast exists, but was
suggesting that anything involving weakly protected money would be a good
target because it highlights the vulnerability and would get media attention.
