It seems that, like a bookstore, the cypherpunks mailing list has the
right to choose the content it distributes and who it distributes the content
to.  Bookstores are free to select what titles they offer for sale, and can
even refuse to sell a book to a particularly annoying customer if they
so choose (my legal knowledge is lacking, but I think this is correct).

To extend the analogy, what has happened in this particular case 
is that Dr. Vulis is now forced to buy all his books by mail order :)
