   TM's statement fits the scientist-become-statesperson
   predilection. It's adduced by the indolent superior-minded
   who relish policy pronouncements over grunge lab work.

   Why else would the fey conceit of worldly wisdom be
   flaunted if not in repugnance at sweaty labor? This
   presumes that nobody in right mind wants a job, but desires
   an esteemed position in society, a title and the perks of
   privilege, with underlings serving.

   Isn't it such delusionary evangelism that keep recruits
   coming to endure the small-minded mono-cultural insultery
   confabulated by these lazy and shiftless pastors, happy as
   pigs in shit, grateful that the heirarchical mindset scam
   works -- even if only through the nauseous flattering of
   their moreso lazy and shiftless benefactors?

   By any means, emulate elitist indolents and avoid anxiety.
   Display iron-fisted civilized beliefs, practice tough-love
   humiliation and master-over-slave manners and militant
   mind-couture, but do nothing truly disruptive of the status
   quo that so rewards niche market exploiters of genuine
   dissent.
