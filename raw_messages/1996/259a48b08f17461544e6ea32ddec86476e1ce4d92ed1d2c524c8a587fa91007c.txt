I find the lack of seperators between what anon wrote, what I wrote, and what
my sig said amusing.

Well, I get the feeling that I am intelligent.  I tested for acceptance into
Mensa, and after finding out my IQ was 156, I felt I had better things to do
than include myself with the 'intelligence elite'.  This list is a cool spot.
I find out a lot of things I didn't know about, and hear a lot of things that
the media isn't going to cover, things called 'rumor' because they don't want
them to be true.

Who knows, maybe we are all dumb.  Either way, it does no good to lament wether
or not we have sufficient intelligence to be referred to as 'itelligent life.'
Personally, I find that it is far more fun to keep on trucking with life, rather
than debate a moot point that we have no control over.
