What is "censoring other people's censorship?" Say I argue in favor of the
CDA. Would you censor me then? Why not? Isn't this censoring others
censorship?

I wonder why the so-called "Freedom Knights" are so insecure in their
beliefs that they will not tolerate a dissenting voice on their mailing 
list. (Let's forget for the moment that my point in subscribing was to
disrupt it. That's not the point, is it? "More speech, more speech!")
