Subject: Netscape appears to be bouncing our stuff around within

I've gotten dozens of these "Message  body suppressed" things, including
copies of my _own_ messages sent out a couple of days ago (and received OK
the first time around).

It looks like " ns.netscape.com " got a copy from toad.com (see bottom of
block below), bounced it around within Netscape, and then resubmitted it to
toad.com (see top of block below), minus the message body.
