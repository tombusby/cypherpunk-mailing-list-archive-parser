The Web reveals all:

1. If the PC has been _reported_ stolen by the owner, any call from that PC
triggers a phone trace, says the company.

2. See #1 (the key is that owner must call and report a particular PC stolen).

These points assume the thief is relatively sophisticated and that the
thief is aware that the CompuTrace system is installed. I suspect that
neither is likely, at least not until the system gets sufficient publicity
so that the first thing thieves and purchasers of suspected-to-be-hot PCs
do is to make plans to avoid this (reformat disks, etc.).

I think the scenario I described in my earlier post on this topic covers
about 97% of all PC thefts: relatively unsophisticated thieves who
warehouse the merchandise until buyers are found. The buyers, in turn, are
also relatively unsophisticated. They may be immigrant businesses looking
for a really good deal on PCs, they may be school systems strapped for
cash, they may be your mother buying her first PC at a flea market.

And they may be any of us, buying a surplus PC.

In none of these cases is the user likely to take steps to disable Caller
ID (and the company may actually do old-fashioned tracing).

I'm not convinced it's software I would want to buy, but it fills a niche,
I think. And it's definitely not the snake oil we've seen recently, as it
makes no outrageous technical claims and seems to be going after a limited
market.
