I think many cryptographers would agree that the S boxes in DES represent 
some pretty weighty ideas indeed, and constitute an intrinsic part of the
algorithm. Offhand the precise construction of the RC2 permutation table
doesn't seem to me to be nearly as important to the strength of RC2 as the
S boxes are to DES' strength. I'm certainly no expert. But I'm a little 
hesitant to dismiss the specified table as "a bit of text". 

Do you think the table would be more like an idea if it turned out to be
determined by pi ?  (not a rhetorical question)
