	Yes. War, especially in the modern era requires a large 
industrial base to maintain (well, non-guerilla operations anyway)

	Yes, as above.               To accomplish his goals, yes. IMO, no.

	Centuries? Maybe 3 of them, the 1600's, 1700's and 1800's, more 
like never.

	There has been a long history of taking the war to the civilians. 
Salting crop land, poisoning wells, burning cities--long before Sherman 
marched on Atlanta civilians were targets. The Aristocracy didn't 
approve publically, but what does a blockade accomplish if not to deprive 
civilians of certain things? Yes, it also keeps it out of the hands of 
the Military, but it also affects non-military.

	War is a most nasty thing, and often fought by people who are at 
very impressionable age (young men). Watching your friends and buddies 
die is a tough thing for most, as is killing other people. For most 
people killing is not something to be done lightly, and it is necessary 
to work them into a state were killing is possible. This state also tends 
to make certain actions seem like a good idea. 

	As to the Strategic decesions like the bombing of Dresden and the 
Nuking of Japan, well, when is the last time a Political leader (and High 
Ranking Generals ARE Political Leaders) actually stopped to consider the 
lives or feelings of people that aren't going to vote for hir?

	I doubt Hitler explicitly said "Kill all the jews for me would 
you Gobby?" but hey, the guy was the ABSOLUTE RULER, he made his desires 
known, and things happened.

	I don't know enough WWII history to know how the Nazis were 
attempting to solve the "Jewish Problem" at Dachau, but I hear that 
Belson was a Gas <sorry>

	I wasn't aware that the US Constitution could be applied outside 
the US. 

 	While I understand why you use a remailer, I wish you'd post some 
address that I could send mail to rather than cluttering up the list.
