How about a real simple rule:  if you don't pass a standardized test (Call it
the SATs w/800 of 1600 minimum) you repeat the grade -  no maximum age!  
Might end some of those "easy A" classes I took.

Yeah.  I'd still say that you'd want to make it pretty easy to switch over - 
I've known a few people who were massively flip-flopping.  Also, some kids
may have hard times (parents divorce, etc) that might screw up their
judgement for awhile. . .

<g>  That seemed to be the general focus last year...  "We may be idiots but
we have school spirit!"

In CA, isn't there the option of taking CHSPE (sp?)  that is like a GED but
instead of sending the "I don't want this" message is more like "I don't want
to waste my time"?
