Note in the following exchange that HC firsts asks for examples
of harm, then when clearly unambiguous examples are given, tries 
to imply that the examples are rare, trivial or (most amazingly)
that the victim did suffer, but must have deserved his/her fate!

Really?  What if the spouse is violently abusive?  You might 
want to leave him and NOT be tracked down and killed.

Unfortunately?  You don't have to be famous to be stalked.  Many
ordinary people are being dogged by former or would-be paramors.
Is it HC's contention that this is only a problem when a 
majority of Cypherpunks suffer from it?

How fatuous.

They happens all to often.  Is this response supposed to be joke?

Yeah, I guess HC is right, the slow ones deserved it.

Yeah, just a few.  Okay by me and HC, I recon.

The odds approach unity over time.

NOYB.  More importantly, since you seem to think privacy isn't
all that important why don't you give us your true name, date of
birth, SS#, mother's maiden name, address where you sleep at 
night, pictures of you (and your family), etc.?  After all, as 
you wrote, the "odds are low" anything will come of it.
