Can the same sort of standards as per the U.S. CDA be applied? The first
draft of the
CDA would have held ISP's responsible for, e.g., porn transmitted using their 
services. Isn't this the same sort of thing - that is, that remailer
operators provide
a service, and they cannot be held responsible for people who abuse that
service? I
think that this line of thought is reasonable.
