True, but removing packaging materials and protective layers is a
long way from imaging the charges tunneled to and from the
floating gates of EEPROM cells, which is the particular
application we are discussing.

Also bear in mind that in a real device, the tamper-resistant
packaging will be considerably more intractable than conventional
semiconductor packaging, and these devices are often designed to
automatically erase all data if signs of tampering are detected.

Yes.  This is truely impressive technology which continues to
improve with leaps and bounds.  SEM/TEM/STEM voltage-contrast
techniques are a major tool for failure analysis of semiconductor
devices, and AFM instruments can do voltage measurements on
running devices down to nanometer and picosecond resolutions.

Correct.  Which is one of the reasons why they are currently the
favored mode of storage for smart card applications.

While I don't necessarily disagree with Perry that sufficiently
advanced technology can reverse-engineer almost anything (the
kind of advanced technology that is indistinguishable from
magick), I think there are practical engineering difficulties in
doing such things today which are either insurmountable or at the
very least a strong indication that there are better ways to
approach the problem.

At the risk of offending Mr. Squid, I must say that SQUIDs were a
big disappointment given the initial hype and expended research
funds.

BTW, I attempted to read all your writings on "Tamper-Resistant
Modules" in the list archives, but as fate would have it, hks.net
has taken the archives offline for a few days to do some sort of
upgrade.

I did get this very nice Cyber Wallet thing off their Web Page,
however, which uses "DES and Full 768 Bit RSA." Although I must
admit I'm not exactly sure what "full" means in this particular
context. :)
