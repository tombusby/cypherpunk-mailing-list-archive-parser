  Friend, 
 
 
  12 31 95 Associated Press reports: 
 
     Ah, the future ...
   
     At least part of what will happen in the coming year 
     seems clear.  Cyberspace will be regulated -- kicking 
     and screaming -- and the court battles over free speech 
     will begin.  "It's going to throw the Internet into a 
     state of uncertainty for several years," said [Bob] Smith 
     [of Interactive Services Association]. 
 
 
  You may recall the question I asked in an earlier message: 
 
     And when the State DECIDES...? 
 
 
  But that's all right... 
 
     Despite that, business growth on the net will begin to 
     catch up with the phenomenal increase in accounts. 

 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim
