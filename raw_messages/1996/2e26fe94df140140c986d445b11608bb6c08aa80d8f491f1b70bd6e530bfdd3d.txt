This is incorrect:  The Mongols had superior technology to the 
people they conquered.  In particular Mongol arrows could penetrate
armor more effectively than anybody else's arrows, and Mongol siege
engines could level city walls far more effectively than anybody
else's siege engine.

It might well seem strange that nomads had higher technology, but
urban civilization of that era was in a twilight era and suffered
great technological stagnation and regression.
