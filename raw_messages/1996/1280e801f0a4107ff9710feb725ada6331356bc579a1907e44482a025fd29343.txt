	The fact that something is complex does not mean your end of
it can not be monitered.  You need to discover random numbers from
something very local to you, or your opponents can mess with your
numbers.  David Wagner posted something about how Mallet could muck
with your RNG if it was based on incoming packet checksums, back in
September.

	If you want good random numbers, track the mouse.  Don't go
looking outside your computer to things other computers do.

	Lastly, using collision-resistant hashing in considered
preferable to encrypting information.
