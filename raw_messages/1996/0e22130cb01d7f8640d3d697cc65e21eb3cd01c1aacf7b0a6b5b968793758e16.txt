I wasn't aware that sound cards made appreciable use of DSP's.  Unlike 
modems, which inherently must massage large amounts of signal to get the 
data, I assumed that sound cards were more like straight A/D/A systems.

You'd put in a hook because it would be easily done, and to fail to do so 
would be a serious mistake.  It could also be bypassed by a hardware switch, 
I suppose, or a software-controlled switch, to make processor intervention 
unnecessary.
