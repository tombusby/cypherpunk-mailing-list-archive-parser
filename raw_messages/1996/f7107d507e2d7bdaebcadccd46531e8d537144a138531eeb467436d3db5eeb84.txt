Hi all, happy new year. 

The Jan 13 Mountain View, California meeting will be held again
at Sun Microsystems, at Sparcy's cafeteria.   That's building 21, 
in the set of Sun buildings near Shoreline Park in Mountain View. 
Take 101 to Amphitheater Parkway exit, turn left onto Charleston 
at the light (this street is also named Garcia at its far end)
and follow the purple Sun signs for building 21.   You'll drive
down Charleston (Garcia) for about 1/3 mile and then turn right
onto a road that in about 3 blocks takes you to B21. 

Please send mail if you have a topic you would like to speak about,
and I'll send out a speaking agenda towards the end of the week.

p.s. I'll bring bagels again but since I never got reimbursed 
last time around I think I will put out the donation jar this
time ...!
