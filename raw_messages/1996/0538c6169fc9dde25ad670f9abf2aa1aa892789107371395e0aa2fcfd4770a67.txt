Good explanation.  But note that reverse engineering is not a way of
getting around patent violations.  It only works to protect oneself from
copyright violations, since a reverse-engineered product is not
(arguably) a copy of the original.  It is also useful when the actual
workings of the original, or the way the original is made, is a (trade)
secret.
