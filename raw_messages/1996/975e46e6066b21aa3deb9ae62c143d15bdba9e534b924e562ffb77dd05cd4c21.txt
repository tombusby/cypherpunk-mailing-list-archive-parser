This could be done with no "storage" as well, by a slightly
different method and still require end reciepient acknowledgement.
The end reciepient could be required to reply and include the encrypted
message. The remailer would then decrypt the message and send back the
plaintext.  Only storage would be the key vs. a message id database.

By reduction - you could just do a rot13 on the message and
append the "legal notice".   If all the information for decoding
a message is present in that message, is a different encoding
mechanism really any different from straight ASCII text?
(i.e. Netscape 9.13 might have auto decoding built it....)
Then, the user doesn't do anything "extra" - does this invalidate
the notice?
 
I might be wrong, but I don't think that this second method would
gain you anything in the 2 situations where operators will get
hassled.  1) Posting of copyrighted material - the lawyers will
at least harass you no matter what kind of legal notice is up front.
2) Mailing of "harassing" information - the person still gets
unwanted email, and has no way to stop it.

Heaven forbid that I use spammers as an idea base, but
to borrow something from them.... Set up the headers
on an anonymous message such that a Reply would result in
the user automatically being placed on the "deny" list.
 
This means that only 1 message gets through.... but, as
Hal has noted, that might be 1 message too many.
 
Similarily, a message sent to the user could be the
"knock", and then a reply would automatically add the
user to the "allow" list as well as forward the
message.... just an automatination of the "knock" idea.
