A)  It is you who is confused (see below)

B)  I'm not Alan Olsen (nor a member of his merry band, so I have
    no idea what you are talking about.

C)  There was a Cypherpunk meeting followed by a party.  The
    pictures are on the Web.

D)  It is your level of honesty that is showing.  As can be seen
    from the two messages (below) I sent you at the time.  They
    quote you in pertinent part.
