It depends entirely on what you mean by "intimidated."

AP would make them pretty damn useless, because instead of the typical 
Palestiniation having to depend on a few corrupt self-chosen leaders, they 
could get their revenge on an individual basis.  Who needs PLO or Hamas 
under such circumstances?   Besides, the Israelis (as well as resentful 
Palestinians) could get rid of abusive PLO or Hamas leadership using AP.

No, because the leadership in the US who would either choose such a system 
(or not) well understand that people who live in glass palaces shouldn't 
start throwing rocks against the enemy leadership.

Assassination can easily fail if you don't give the proper people the 
motivation to accomplish the task. The key to having it work out is to 
ensure that the few people who have access to the target are sufficiently 
motivated to collect the reward. Who, exactly, was given a motivation to 
kill Castro?  A few clowns in Miami?  A few crooks in Jersey?

Give _everybody_ who meets Castro during the day a $10 million motivation to 
kill him, and he'll be dead before sunset.

Since it's never been tried before, how do you know?

I don't doubt that there will be many people who misunderstand AP.  You're 
obviously one of them.

Pardon me, but what's wrong with this?    Follow the news more closely, and 
you'll hear of a group which is operating in southern Mexico, the "EPR," 
which is killing off government employees, politicians, and police.  True, 
they're not implementing the mathematical, digital-cash basis behind AP, but 
they see to be making good progress against the corruption which is Mexico.  
Increase their productivity by a factor of 10, and the Mexican government 
would be terrified.  Increase it by 100, and the Mexican government would 
fall within a few months.

Does that make YOU responsible if, by calling for people to NOT kill their 
oppressors, they continue to suffer oppression?

Then you obviously don't understand the meaning of the word, "censorship."
