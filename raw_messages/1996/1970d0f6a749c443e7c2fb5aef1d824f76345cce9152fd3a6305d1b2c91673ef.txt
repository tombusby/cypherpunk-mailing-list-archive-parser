  First a disclaimer.  I have not studied the drafts of the protocol,
or been directly involved with its development.  I do know a few things
and I will try to answer to the best of my abilities.

  I don't know if the spec will specify SSL as the required transport, but
I think that our products will use it.

  RSA will be used in addition to DES (or perhaps something stronger).

  There is stuff in the protocol to prevent MITM and replay attacks.
I'm not familiar with the details, but I know that they have been
thinking about these problems for a long time.

  It is hard to get even the flavor of the protocol in a press release that
has been dumbed down for the general population.  I believe that the spec
will be released for a public review period before it is finalized, so you
should have a chance to review it and get your comments in.
