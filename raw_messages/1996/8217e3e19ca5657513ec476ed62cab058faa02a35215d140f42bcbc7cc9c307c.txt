Some day, the "embarrassment" may be among those who misunderstood an idea 
that is, by then, fully operational and was an improvement over the previous 
system.  I seem to recall some funny poster titled something like "The five 
stages of a new idea"  which starts out "It'll never work"  and ends up, "I 
knew it would work all along!"

I'd like to know what they mean by using the term "rejected."  A rejection 
without an alternative is irresponsible.  Assuming they agree that the 
status quo is unacceptable, and if they believe that change is possible, 
then what is their solution?

Moreover, what is the real meaning of the word "rejected" in this context?  
You can't "reject" gravity, or a hurricane, or eventual death.

In fact, I'd argue that it's inextricably linked to good encryption.  
Defending one will ultimately defend the other.

Now _that's_ an excellent idea!  Libel laws never protect the 
anti-establishment, non-mainstream portion of the public, for one.

Thanks...uh...I think...

True.  And it's not just the quantity of deaths that'll be lowered:  The 
"quality" of those deaths (the justification for killing the target) will go 
up, which may seem to be an odd way to refer to it.  Most of us will agree 
that if there was some way to swap the death of the victim, automatically, 
for the death of the criminal or attacker, that would be far more just 
arrangement, as well as rather rapidly deterring future killings.  

An example of the exact opposite is frequently exposed in discussing 
anti-gun-carry laws, which only disarm law-abiding citizens and leave the 
criminals armed.  Such laws, therefore, actually swap the death of the 
criminal for the death of the victim.

Moreover, the number of people wanting to kill the "unjustified" target will 
be extremely low, meaning that one odd donor would have to pay a large 
amount of money to get "action" on his donation.

You and a few million other people.  Which is why AP will work so well 
getting rid of governments...and criminals.

That's exactly correct.  But also, the very existence of such a system will 
_deter_ such people, meaning that it is very likely you won't have to pay 
for anybody's death at all...except for a few that resignation won't save.

Nope.  Not when there are so many other deserving targets!    B^)

It wouldn't do any good...
