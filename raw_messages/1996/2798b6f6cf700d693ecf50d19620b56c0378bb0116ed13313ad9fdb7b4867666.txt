I think that sometimes, one's cumulative reputation must count for something.
Most of the people who are included in this 'list of shame' have contributed
enormously to the furtherance of the crypto field in general.  Whether I conscribe
to their viewpoints or not on a given subject, it is rather easy for me to think
of something they have written which I use as a rather concrete reference.  Thusly,
given a track record of open and noteworthy thought on the field, I find it difficult
to denounce, as an example, Bruce Schneier.  Especially IF it's only a matter of
sharing a difference of opinion on a given bill or set of bills before our lawmakers.

Considering the fact that I've not seen Mr. Schneier come out on either side of the
Leahy Bill or, for that matter, many of the other bills currently before the congress,
it's hard for me to support mail-bombing him or many of the others on the list.
I think that the anonymous poster is behaving in a manner which I find
reprehensible in calling for such measures.  Therefore I simply ignore most of
the postings which match the pattern of the List Of Shame.  Have I researched
what statements or postings could have brought about the addition in the 
beginning?

Nope.

And since Mr/Ms Anonymous has chosen not to cite any particular references,
I'm not inclined to follow his/her lead.

To follow the example of several hundred thousand lemmings is not often
gauged as a wise thing.  Provide me a REASON to believe there has been
a treachery perpetrated, and perhaps that cliff won't look quite so high.
