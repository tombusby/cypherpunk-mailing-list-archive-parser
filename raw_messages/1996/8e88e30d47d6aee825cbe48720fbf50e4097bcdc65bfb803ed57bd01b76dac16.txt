It might almost be nice to have the legislative session go out on a note of
"We were working on a bill to re-emphasize the Constitutional right
to private speech" rather than a note of "We came for the pornographers,
and you narco-terrorist child-porn-hiding cryptographers* are next on our
List**!"

...especially if it gives us some slack time to improve the (serious)
weakness of the positive-sounding parts of the bill.  Is Senator Leahy
up for re-election this round?
