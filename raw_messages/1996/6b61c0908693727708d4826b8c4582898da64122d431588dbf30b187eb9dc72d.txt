I received thei week an advertisment for the 1996 CardTech/SecureTech conference proceedings.
These people have a web site at <http://www.ctst.com>, but it's really lame. 
(It doesn't contain this table of contents, for example)


Since I am not building/using/designing smart card technology right now, I won't be buying it.
However, the some of the titles caught my eye:

Does anyone have access to this kind of stuff, and would they be willing to post a summary?
