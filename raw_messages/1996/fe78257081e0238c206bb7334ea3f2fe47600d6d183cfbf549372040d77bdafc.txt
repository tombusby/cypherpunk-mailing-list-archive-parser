I saw this on the Web. I've never used it.

MacPGP Control (or MPGPC for short) is an AppleScript application that offers an
easy-to-use, more Macintosh friendly user interface to MacPGP.

MacPGP Control relies on your AppleScript-aware version of MacPGP to
perform encryption
and decryption. For information on how to obtain MacPGP in the USA or
Canada, first refer to that site using your FTP client (Anarchie, Fetch,
etc...) or a World Wide Web browser (Netscape, MacWeb, etc...). For non-USA
citizens, information on how to obtain MacPGP is available at Ståle
Schumacher's International PGP Home Page.

The main features of MPGPC are grouped into three categories:

       MacPGP related features
       Eudora and Claris Em@iler related features
       Macintosh related features

The current version of MacPGP Control is 1.0 fc 1. You need, among other
things, the
Scriptable Finder to run MPGPC. If you don't have it or cannot obtain a
legal copy, I cannot help you and you will be wasting your time and money
downloading this software. All other components are available.

MacPGP Control is US$15 shareware.
