Not to mention that this is complete nonsense and a troll. No matter how 
weak the MD5 algorithm may or may not be, there are an infinite number of 
possible messages for each checksum. And thus the original message could 
NEVER be restored. Its as secure as a OTP. That's why its called a 
'one-way' hash function.

Not to mention the fact that he misspelled both 'entropy' and 'after'.


P.S. But imagine if it was true! MD5 would become the ultimate compression 
algorithm. Any message could be reduced to a 128 bit archive.
