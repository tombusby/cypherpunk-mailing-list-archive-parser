I doubt the age figure, and would want to see confirmation before using it.
Certainly most people I deal with on the Net seem to be younger than 30-35,
though this may be a reasonable _average_ (if not _median_). But the rest
of the stats fit.

An old movie name, of course. And "Triumph of the Nerds" was the name of
the recent PBS/Mark Stevens program. (I hate the term "nerd," as I hate the
names "dweeb," "geek," "jerk," etc. Believe me, anyone who thinks being
called a "nerd" is complimentary, or anyone who labels himself as a "geek,"
is probably one who would call himself a "nigger," or a "queer.")

"Guarantees"? You ask "what or who guarantees" a better job? I am speechless.

There are no guarantees, friend. Not in this reality. Jobs are not
something created by the stroke of a Presidential pen--jobs are what we
call the exchange of labor or brainpower for money or other considerations.
If Alice wants a new roof, and Bob offers to roof her house for a price she
think is reasonable, this is a "job" for Bob. And so on.

I don't, actually. As to "working at a low paying job...", it's a matter
for them to work out, perhaps by getting new skills, perhaps by working two
jobs, perhaps by opening a business. The statistics on where wealth was
created in the 1985-95 period show it overwhelmingly came from new
entrepreneurial efforts.

????

Not a persuasive argument.
