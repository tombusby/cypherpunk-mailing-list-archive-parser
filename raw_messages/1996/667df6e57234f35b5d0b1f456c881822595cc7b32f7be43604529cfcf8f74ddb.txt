I visited there from Netscape. Didn't give my user name but 
apparently said "You are affiliated with ASB Internet, Inc. ..." and 
then displayed a bunch of advertising info by ISP puts out.

An amusing thought: fill the personal info fields with business 
advertisements.  Perhaps people who surf the web regularly can sell 
advertising space.

Have you tried mailing yourself by putting something else in there? I 
remember trying that and seeing from the headers that I sent it (the 
usual "Received by ..." username -> machine paths.) Of course that 
was on a University's computer system, so they may have patched the 
sources.
