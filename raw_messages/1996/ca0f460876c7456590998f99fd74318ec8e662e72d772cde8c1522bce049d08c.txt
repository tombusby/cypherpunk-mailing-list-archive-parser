	Preaching to the choir, but once again it is a case of nothing
new. The potential for economic terrorism is not significantly larger
given the existance of the internet than it was before. This is what needs
to constantly be drummed into the technically dis-inclined, that the same
problems exists off the net that exist ON the net.

	I would go so far as to say that you can cause MORE havoc in the
physical arena than the virtual.
