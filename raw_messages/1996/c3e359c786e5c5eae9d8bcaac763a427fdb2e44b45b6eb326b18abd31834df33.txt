Of course.  But this does not address the issue of "unscrupulous 
spammers" which is what Steven was commenting upon.

Okay fine.  The spammer is "advised" but if he is unscrupulous in the 
first place, he'll simply ignore the advice and continue bulk-mailing 
to every address he can grab.

Indeed, stupid low-tech spammers would benefit from such a service if 
they wish to honor "do not send" requests.

I like the idea and if I had the resources, I would do it personally. 
Optimistically, many bulk e-mailers would sign on to the plan.  
(Ironically, one would probably have to solicit bulk e-mailers to 
sign up).  However, many, being unscrupulous, ignorant, etc. will not 
be involved.

The only way I see to get bulk e-mailers to utilize this service is 
to offer a positive and/or negative incentive for usage of the 
service.  ie. "What do I gain by elminating people from my bulk 
mail-outs?  What can be done if I don't follow this protocol?"

Ideas?  Comments?
