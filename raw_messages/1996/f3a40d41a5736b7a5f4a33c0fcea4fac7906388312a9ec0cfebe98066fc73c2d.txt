Oh, THANK YOU SO MUCH for discussing us in the third person.  Guess what.
There ARE women on the list (myself being one of them).  (I thought that the
men/women ratio was more like 46/54.)

This particular woman says that it's sooooo tiresome to wade through a lot
of posturing and (even worse) the "me-toos" wherein people quote the entire
post and then say, oh, yeah, I agree with that also.  It's soooo easy to
quit even reading the threads and just delete the whole thing.

SUBTLE HINT MODE ON
(Ah, so what do you propose, then, Miss Smartypants?) (AHEM!  It's my brain
that's smart, you lecher!)  I'm on other lists and I've noticed that when
they go to digest form much of the me-too-ness drops out.  Is it that
important to get 100 emails a day, if 80% of it is crap?

Now, this part might sound more "womanish" -- it's nice to get an idea of
the people posting, and have PRIVATE conversations.  Most people don't care
to see blanc and dale bash it out over fifteen posts.  It's junk mail
littering our in boxes!  It's TASTELESS!
...furthermore, it's not cool.  [Rabid soapboxing about what is and isn't
cool omitted.]

Oh, yes you do.  Consider yourself lectured.  Stick to the topics, or stray
on a RELATED subject.  Jess Dubroff ISN'T.  Complicitous news media IS.


ENOUGH!  No followup posts!  Take my advice and smoke it!  Er, wait.  That
doesn't sound right.  And for those of you who are just WAITING to flame me,
don't bother.  I'm not a feminazi, not an "uppity woman", just a chick
