Not everyone who sends food to the starving children is ultra
respectable.

Problem is that the usual cause of starving children is tyranny.  
In order to get close enough to the starving children to take 
those cute fund raising photographs you have to pay off and get 
cosy with tyrants.  This creates a moral hazard, in that it is 
hard to tell the difference between normal bribery needed to do 
anything in a tyrannical state, and bribery to bribe tyrants to 
create starving children for photo ops.

It is very common for international charities to develop excessively 
friendly relationships with murderous tyrannies,

Monsters do not generally sport horns and a tail.  More commonly
they walk around on two legs with large neon halos prominently
displayed.
