Please unplug your server from the Internet immediately, and do not plug
it back in until all database entries based on other than publicly
available information have been scrubbed. Please refer any Stanford
affiliates involved with your project to the thread concerning your
activities in the su.computers newsgroup.

Thank you. Have a nice day.
