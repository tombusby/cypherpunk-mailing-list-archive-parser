That depends on what you mean by "IR."  Near-IR is about 300 Terahertz; I've 
seen some items in electronic magazines recently concerning systems that 
emit and receive around 1 terahertz.  Apparently, they can read writing in 
envelopes, etc.  It isn't clear whether this particular system is more like 
a thermal IR system, or one of those newer ones.

Chances are good that when such a system is produced, it will be produced 
WITHOUT any kind of recording system that must be installed.  The problem 
is, this leaves it open to interpretation as to what a cop saw, and judges 
and juries tend to be too deferential to cops who "are trying to protect 
us."  All a cop has to do is to claim he saw a gun, or drugs, or practically 
anthing else, and suddenly he has probable cause where he wouldn't have had 
it before.  Yet more abuse with no obvious benefit.

All the more reason to adopt an AP-type system:  The so-called "justice 
system" rarely punishes its own; if we are to have a realistic deterrent, 
the only way to do it is to let outsiders deal with abuse.
