The ONLY reason this is "not at all clear" is because of those 9 
morons-for-life they have currently sitting in that wasted building near the 
Congress building have never been particularly careful to follow the rules.  

I believe that this would be a "clear violation of the 5th amendment."   
Whether those 9 nincompoops agree is still up in the air.  Given the fact 
that they were chosen for their current jobs after a long history of 
"getting along" with system, their "reliability" to hold the government's 
line is quite understandable.

Actually, he doesn't know this.  As long as the data being held "looks like" 
random data, and contains no headers, as far as anybody knows it IS random 
data.  The data holder cannot know.

What you seem to have forgotten is that if the scenario you describe could 
really occur "in real life," this is all the more reason for ordinary 
citizens to REFUSE to use any kind of key-escrow system, or to do so in a 
way which is completely undetectable.  Naturally, you won't address this 
problem, but the man-on-the-street is more realistic about his own privacy.  
How many times must I raise this issue?  How many times do you ignore it?  
Face it, people are smarter than you give them credit for.  They will simply 
not tolerate any more shit from the government.

Was the government lying to us when they claimed that "key escrow will be 
voluntary"?  Or was this some odd new usage of the word "voluntary" that 
only appears in the "Newspeak Dictionary"?

With every new post you send, you simply go to prove that every concern that 
anybody ever had about the government's behavior is potentially reasonable.  
You really ought to quit while you're behind.
