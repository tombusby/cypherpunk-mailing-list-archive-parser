Don't know. This did have full input from security agencies, however.

No restrictions domestically nor in Canada. Even so, these CAs and the
policy body above it clearly give the govt. more of a role in controlling
crypto.

No indications they would. Idea is each authority could talk to the other
and request escrowed keys or info. a la interpol. Of course, as today,
there's no guarantee that agreements will always be in place, nor honored.

Under the White Paper, yes.

Which makes it look a lot like the old proposal.

If it's legal now, the paper suggests it should be legal in the future.

The Paper is quite unclear on this, as well. Presumabyt other countries
will have equally spiffy stuff they will require be escrowed for export
under COCOM. ALl of this, of course, assumes cooperation from OECD, et al.

Same as before.
