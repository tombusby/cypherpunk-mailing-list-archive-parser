I find it interesting that you see Willam H. Geiger as a spokesman for
the cypherpunks list.  Remember, the list is open to anyone who can
operate majordomo except one.

The level of vitriol expressed by random e-mail users in the whole
world can hardly be said to be a "point" in anyone's favor.

Irrelevant, of course.  Some of the most terrible people in the world
have been pleasant.  D. Denning may or may not be the most terrible
person in the world, but her pleasantness is unrelated.

Personally, what I have found irritating about Denning is the fact
that she is widely considered to be a credible spokesperson.
Statements along the lines of "I can't tell you the scenarios we are
worried about because they are classified" are a little hard to take
seriously in a democracy.

Imagine if you or I tried to claim that we had to deploy strong crypto
but that for "reasons of cypherpunk security" the scenarios with which
we were concerned could not be revealed.  We would be laughed out of
the forum and properly so.

Denning is considered credible solely because her statements are
consistent with the interests and views of those in authority.

Denning has little to add to the cypherpunks list.  The core belief of
the cypherpunks is that their mail is their business.  People who do
not believe this are not cypherpunks and should not subscribe to the
list nor should they post to it.
