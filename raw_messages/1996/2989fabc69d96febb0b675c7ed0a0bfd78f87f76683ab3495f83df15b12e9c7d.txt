And if the government should take the position that the mere existence of an 
anonymous encrypted remail allows for illegal use, without detection by the 
operator, then a person could easily argue that the mere willful OPERATION 
of that remailer violates the section.

I disagree.  At least, I disagree that this interpretation will be 
automatically adopted by the government thugs.

Which brings up a case from the midwest which (fortunately) was overturned 
by the SC a few years ago.  Seems a person was repeatedly sent ads (in 
reality, the ads came from the government!) offering some kind of 
pornographic material.  A "long time" later, he eventually "bit" and ordered 
something.  Needless to say, this was enough to get a search warrant, and a 
prosecution.  

Question:  Despite the fact that this conviction was eventually overturned, 
don't you think the prospect of a multi-year all-out battle with the 
prosecutors would be enough to deter people from doing things that they 
believed might really be legal, but would be looked on with disfavor by 
equally-sleazy prosecutors?

Why is it that I get the impression that the people who don't see this 
provision as being so bad have no sense of reality?  Are they not aware of 
the various ways prosecutors abuse their positions?

yet.

In other words, they're aiming the gun at you, but they don't quite yet have 
their finger on the trigger.  When, exactly, do you start worrying?
