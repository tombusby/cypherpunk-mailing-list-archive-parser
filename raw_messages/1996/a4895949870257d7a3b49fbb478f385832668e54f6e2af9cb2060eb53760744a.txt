This is a problem with the web of trust in general.  It is known as "Guilt
by Association".  

Person X commits treasonable act A.  All of the persons who are signed on to
his key could be considered to be co-conspirators.  The same applies to
nyms.  The difficulty with prosecuting nyms is finding the link to the real
world individual.  Anyone associated with him/her/it will be considered to
be guilty by reason of key signage or a way of determining who the real
person is...

The only way I see getting around this is only signing nyms with nyms or
having some sort of zero knowlege proof on a key signing authority.
Something where you can issue some sort of proof to the signing authority
that you are who you say you are without giving any information about your
"real" identity.  I know of no foolproof way of doing this...

I guess we are stuck with the "Web of Guilt"...
