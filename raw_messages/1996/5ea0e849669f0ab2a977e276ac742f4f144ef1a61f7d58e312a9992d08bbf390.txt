Does this mean that you can fly without showing any identification? It sounds like it.

What is to prevent my company from getting a half dozen of these cards, and when someone in the company needs to travel, loading a card with the travel info and giving it to the traveller?

Note that (as far as the airline or FCC is concerned) there is no person <<-->> card mapping.

Other scenarios:
Will travel agents be able to issue these cards?
How about airport ticket agencies?
Will people be able to buy cards for cash?

I think that you have this backwards. There will be less tracking ability for people flying w/o tickets.
