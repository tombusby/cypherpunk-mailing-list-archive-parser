Aside from that, the traceroute of that IP address just happens to take it to nlights.net, which is apparently somehow affiliated with AOL, but in any case, the WWW pages the spam points to just HAPPEN to list down at the bottom an email address to contact the author which isn't a remailing service like geocities or hotmail.  It's zerofaith@nlights.net.
