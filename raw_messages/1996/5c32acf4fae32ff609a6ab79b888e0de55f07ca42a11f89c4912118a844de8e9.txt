Well, I freely admit that it was just a notion that sort of came
to me whilst at the terminal, with a beer on the desk.  The sort
of thing that often impairs my already-limited judgment :)

Although... is this a possible way to lessen remailer-operator
liability?  If it is known that every remailer along the
way chooses another remailer at random, it might become
less likely to hold any given last-hop remailer liable
for the CO$ documents spewed forth from it.  It would
become necessary to keep track of the final destination and
to decrypt at every stage, unless there's a set Last-Hop:
header; but that would defeat the whole purpose.  Having
traffic going all over the place randomly might be useful
to defeat traffic analysis, though.

I think I've just argued myself out of the whole idea.
Never mind :)
