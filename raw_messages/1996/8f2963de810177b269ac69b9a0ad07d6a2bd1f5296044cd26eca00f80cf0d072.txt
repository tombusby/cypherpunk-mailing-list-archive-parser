Interesting that IPG sent two copies of this to the list under different
nyms.  Must be a ploy to get around killfiles.

I need quote no mre than this.  A PRNG can produce *only* pseudo-random
numbers, and nothing else.  No amount of handwaving will transform
pseudo-random numbers into anything else.  The IPG system produces a
seeded pseudo-random keystream, which is assuredly not a true one time
pad.

Another *PLONK*.
