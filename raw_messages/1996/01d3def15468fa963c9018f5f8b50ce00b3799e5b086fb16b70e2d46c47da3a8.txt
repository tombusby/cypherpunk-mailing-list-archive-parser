Do you mean readable by "controlled"?  I thought I knew what you meant by
that :-)  If you do mean readable, I don't see how that would make a
difference since so many people would still be encrypting their mail.  If
you mean controled as in being able to encrypt messages would be
controlled, that the govt. would have final say over whether one could
encrypt or not, then unless they pass legislation specifically outlawing
encryption, or encryption not readable by them, they could have no such
control.  Even if they did legislate, they could not enforce reliably
because to many would be breaking that law anyway.  Plus, the law would
(should, he says kneeling and praying) be struck down as unconstitutional
by the fourth.

Perhaps I had better.  I do know that if employers do have jurisdiction,
then my point about employers encouraging encryption should still hold
(barring legislative prohibition).  If it does not, then I conceed that you
are correct in saying that it would *affect* traffic, but it would not
totally control it.  As for universities, the traffic here would be
affected as well, as you say.  There would still have to be some
justification for imposing such a restriction and it would be demanded by
the students and the parents of the students, but it still could be
sucessful (how frightening this is!)

I think that the comming standards announced by credit companies will take
care of secure transactions, and I still don't see where the govt. would
have to do with controlling traffic here.  Just as we have many credit
cards, we will have many online accounts, each with their methods of
secure, verifiable trasactions.  Methods for payment and security will
become increasingly easy to use and software will be written to accomidate
these features.
