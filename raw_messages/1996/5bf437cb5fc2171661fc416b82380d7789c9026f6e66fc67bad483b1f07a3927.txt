    Thank you CRAM for your informative and interesting peices aznd
snippets from the American Press. Out here in the land of Oz, the state
governements are whipping up a frenzy of legislation, including laws
prohibiting the uploading or downloading of any material that may be
offensive to minors. Penalty: $25000 and/or 1 year in jail. The push is on
to make ISPs the defacto publishers and censors of all material that
passes through them. And as always its the child pronography thing that
predominates the discussion. It is unfortunate that at the same time the
internet is booming, there is a huge peadophile hunt going on here in
Sydney (turns out the peodophiles have powerfull allies amongst the
policians and judges, no surprises there). People open their newspapers
and see "Peadophiles use internet" and their minds shut like steel doors.

    Keep up the good work.
