Perry, as you are so fond of quoting Dobbertin, let me forward once again to 
the list Hans' analysis of the "crack" that he discovered.  He explicitly 
agrees with Mr. Ogren's analysis.  Yes it is prudent to move away from MD5.
But there are still plenty of uses where it is more than sufficient.
