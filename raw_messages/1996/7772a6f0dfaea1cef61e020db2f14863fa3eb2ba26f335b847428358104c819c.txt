(I passed this message by Adam Back, and he can make this schedule. So,
here it is. Unless serious objections are raised--e.g., a conflict with
another party--I suggest we do this.)

There is no Cypherpunks event scheduled for that Saturday, but we can have
an ad hoc gathering, informally arranged. I suggest meeting at 3 p.m. at
Cody's Bookstore, on El Camino Real in Menlo Park (hard to miss). Or at the
coffee shop next to it...either should be sufficient Schelling points to
nucleate a group.

This should be close enough (a few miles) from Redwood City...a lot closer
for Adam that the 50 miles for me. But I always need good excuses to visit
the Valley.
