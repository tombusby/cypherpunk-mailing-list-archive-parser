	A bit of interesting information about teleport. Still not as good
as c2 (as I stated), but it's still good to have multiple anonymous account
providers around... whether or not they mean to be anonymous. This is from a
sysadmin type there (why I deleted the name) who I'll ask about the Majordomo
patch.

True, but a log file without a name, address, phone# or SS# to attach to it
is worth *very* little.... :)
