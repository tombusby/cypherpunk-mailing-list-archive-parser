(Though I made up this last part, it represents reality. Postal inspectors
frequently collaborate with various national and international authorities
on matters involving pornography, fraud, pyramid schemes, and the sending
of various sorts of contraband. While FedEx, UPS, Airborne, etc., may
occasionally cooperate when a crime is called to their attention, I know of
no cases where Federal Express, for example, has become a willing and
leading partner in setting up stings. This is why the "Postal Service,"
despite nominal status as a a quasi-independent corporation, is actually
yet another enforcement arm of the government.)

The Postal Service probably has zero chance of getting into the e-mail
business in any fashion, much as they might want to. Businesses see too
many advantages in direct transmission, and are unlikely to hand the USPS
some money for the dubious benefit of slowing down the mail and (maybe)
adding some kind of signature. This is a case where businesses are fully
able to understand the role of independent encryption, signatures,
credentialling agencies, etc.

"Postal anarchy" is already the accepted norm for e-mail.
