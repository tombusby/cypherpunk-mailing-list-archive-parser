>U.K. INTERNET PROVIDERS PLAN TO RESTRICT CYBERPORN
>Reacting to pressure from Scotland Yard, the Internet Service Providers
>Association, representing 60 of an estimated 140 providers in the United
>Kingdom, will be asking its members to voluntarily block access to sites
>and services featuring hard-core pornography.  An executive of Demon
>Internet, which has the largest subscriber base in the U.K., dismisses the

	I suspect that the largest subscriber base is about to get larger...

>PRIVACY VS. FREEDOM-OF-INFORMATION ON THE WEB
>A computer consultant in Oregon paid the state $222 for its complete motor
>vehicles data base, which he then posted to a Web site, prompting charges
>of privacy violations from people who complained that he had invaded their
>privacy.  The database allows anyone with an Oregon license plate number to
>look up the vehicle owner's name, address, birthdate, driver's license
>number, and title information.  The consultant's motive in posting the
>information, which anyone can obtain for a fee by going to a state office,
>was to improve public safety by allowing identification of reckless
>drivers.  Oregon Governor John Kitzhaver says that instant access to motor
>vehicle records over the Internet is different from information access
>obtained by physically going to state offices and making a formal request
>for information:  ``I am concerned that this ease of access to people's
>addresses could be abused and present a threat to an individual's safety.''
>(Associated Press 8 Aug 96)

	At least they mentioned that it was publically available... but I don't
see any difference between net.availability and physical.availability.
