True.  I wasn't proposing any centralized list or a complete alternative to
the current way remailers are set up.  Just an alternative for some people who
don't have time to go through all the complaints.  The only unblocked addresses
could just be the addresses of other remailers.  Others could be set up to
only deliver mail to other remailers, mailing lists, and newsgroups.

If every remailer adopted this system, then this would be true.

This is a good idea.  I also like the idea of remailers forwarding some sort
of notification to a first-time recipient where the recipient actually has to
request that the mail be delivered.  However, the storage requirement might be
a little impractical for some remailers.  If the disclaimers are really
annoying, it would be easy enough to remove these disclaimers with a simple
procmail recipe or some equivalent.

The "cutmarks" option would allow backwards compatability.  Alternatively, the
remailer might be able to determine whether the next hop is a "real" email
address or another remailer.  I believe this would be pretty easy with
Mixmaster since a remailer can tell if it is the final hop or not.
