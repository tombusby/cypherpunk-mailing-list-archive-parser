  only people who need to do anything are people overseas using PGP 2.6i or 
  2.6ui in their businesses.  They need to license IDEA from Ascom."

As another data point, I (sitting in Australia)
attempted to buy a licence through the Web page
and encrypted emailed credit card, and in return
received a phone call from Zurich. I was informed
that IDEA was not patented in Australia, and my
attempt to pay was appreciated but declined.

Europe generally has patent coverage I believe.
