E-LEX is a new email list for the discussion of the design of dictionaries
with electronic interfaces.

Topics may include:
        * the possibilities of hypertext/hypermedia for the electronic
                interface
        * adaptation of machine-readable dictionaries to user-friendly
                human-usable form
        * issues in conversion and adaptation of paper dictionaries to
                electronic form

The list's new homepage is at http://www.ling.nwu.edu/~sburke/e-lex/
