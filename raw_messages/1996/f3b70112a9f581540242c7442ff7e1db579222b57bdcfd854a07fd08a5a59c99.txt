I wonder what golden age of journalism these guys have in mind. Journalism 
is garbage and it always has been. After all, it is what connects you with 
your culture. It's a dirty job.

A couple of more fully fascist rags would be hard to find. Misinformation, 
disinformation and total lack of substance -- it's all style. The L.A. 
Times is a close runner-up with its one hundred year history of self 
interest, red-baiting of organized labor and political "enemies" broken 
only by a few periods of acting as a propaganda mill and inspiring a few 
race riots. Take a look at the masthead of, say, a 1943 edition.

Does 'faux style' mean 'fucked style'? If so, then kissing is appropriate.

There are multiple issues of relevance:
1. The coding and decoding of messages in apparent plaintext.
2. Assumptions about the authenticity of sources and motives in message 
creation.
3. The separation of form and content in written language which I suggest 
cannot be separated.
4. The apparent political center of gravity of message subscribers. Let's 
say, this mailing list for instance.
