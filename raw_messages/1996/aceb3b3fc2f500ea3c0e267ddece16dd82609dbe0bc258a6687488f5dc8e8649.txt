I'm unsubscriving from the list for a few days (weeks?) until the 
noise level drops down a bit.  I'll check it periodically on the Web
and I'm pretty sure that if something happens that shakes the world
of cryptography to its very foundations, someone will probably send 
me some email about it. 

Please continue to party while I am away.
