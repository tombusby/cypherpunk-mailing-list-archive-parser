Don't forget the other side of the conversation. While the government 
cannot (notice I did not say they might not try) effectively control
communication, there are other points at which control may be exerted:

1) communications *with* the government (IRS, Social Security, etc).
2) communications using someone else's equipment/network (university,
   employer, etc)
3) communications with anyone (Internet merchant, etc) who says "this
   is not what <MasterCard|Visa|AmEx> approves..."

Each of these may have compelling reasons for complying with what the
government wants even if it is not law. IMNSHO "law" is just a means
for exacting retribution/revenge - if you have to resort to it, you
have already lost.
						Warmly,
