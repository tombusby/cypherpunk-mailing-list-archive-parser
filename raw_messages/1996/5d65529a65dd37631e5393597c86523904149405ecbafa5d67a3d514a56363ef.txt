      I am quite aware of this; I grew up in the South. In practice, it
wasn't seperate but equal; it was separate but unequal. This was the intent of
the persons pushing it, which made them racist. (They are also justifiably
classified as racist on many other grounds).

      Persons who wish to organize for _racist_ ideology, yes. But assuming
that every separatist is actually a racist is about like assuming that everyone
on this list is an anarcho-capitalist; while correct in the majority of cases,
it isn't correct in all. (You and I are both exceptions, for instance.)
