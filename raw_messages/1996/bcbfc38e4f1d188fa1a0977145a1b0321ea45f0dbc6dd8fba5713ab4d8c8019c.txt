I've written the server from scratch, and don't have much of a mudlib at
this point.  The language is lisp-ish, although I'm planning to write a
parser for a c-like syntax.  It's properly tail-recursive, has explicit
continuations, and has associative arrays as a native datatype.

It's probably easiest for me to create an account on umop-ap.com for
anyone interested in collaborating with me.  If the consensus is that
starting with an existing MUD is easier, that's fine too.

Are DC-nets useful for anything besides anonymous broadcast?  I'd probably
cheat on implementation unless there is some other property that I'm missing.

For network-related stuff, I've been considering a fantasy setting, but one
that allows for "magical" instantaneous long-distance communication between
any two objects.  Web servers wind up being persistent spells, email is
really easy, and so on.

I'm reluctant to involve the outside world in a MUD except as a source
of players.  This is partially due to security and extra programming
complexity, but mostly because I'd want to isolate the game from the
pressures that being a remailer or anonymizer brings.

With the possible exception of Escrow, I'd make these player functions
rather than server functions.  They are important, of course.

There are a number of things in "Applied Cryptography" that I missed,
significantly:

Timestamping
Subliminal channels
Secure multiparty Computation
Blind signatures
Oblivous Transfer

It could be PC-run, too.  Then again, how can you tell the difference?

I'm still primarily looking at the game aspect.  After all, if it isn't
an interesting game, then there won't be enough players to get meaningful
results.  We need real humans making the various economic decisions in
order to reduce the consequences of programmer bias.

Also, there's the teaching possibility.  Where a simulation would only
appeal to those who are already of a libertarian bent, a working anarchic
MUD might reach others.

If a new character is significatly weaker than an experienced character,
then this may not be a problem.  They simply wouldn't have enough of
a chance against a real target to be more than an annoyance.  Alternately,
having the game prevent new characters from starting fights with other
players stops this quite quickly.  That's what we did on the LPmud I ran.

I'd prefer that the only rules be against trying to bring down the server,
though.  What's the point of an anarchy with rules?

For the general problem of making player death costly, I'd been planning
on having some abilities reside in a "soul" and some in the "body".  If
a body dies, that's it for that body.  The player has to start over with
a new, untrained, body.  This can be a problem if, for example, the soul's
main fighting skill is with a weapon that the body isn't yet strong enough
to lift.

Since real-world stuff is apparently nearly immune to brute force, I'd
go all the way and make the game stuff truly immune.  Breakability is
a feature that just isn't worth the effort to code, especially since
we're interested in the consequences of unbreakable crypto.

I could go either with that, or a net that really is secure and unsnoopable.

The obvious analogue to software in a fantasy setting is spells.  This
requries security of the server from arbitrary player code, but that's
been one of my design goals for some time.

A general disclaimer that anything can be logged is almost mandatory.
Logs are too useful for debugging.  Still, I'd prefer to periodically
trim the logs so that no one can meaningfully demand them.  Besides,
writings from a player perspective are probably better anyway.

Now that I think about it, having a character (player or non) who acts
as a historian and news service would be good anyway.

As for logging without real identities, that's not enough -- pseudonyms
can be recognized and outed by textual analysis.  A certain amount of
caution is always necessary if you're doing something that you wouldn't
want made public, but I don't want the MUD to require any more than that
fundamental minimum.

How about mud@umop-ap.com?  I'm currently the only subscriber, but that
can be fixed.
