This is little better than leaving it around in a plaintext file, a pass
or two with gdb on your binary and I have your private key.

The "difficult, expensive, and pain in the ass code to write" solution that
I favor is to use secure multiparty computation to create the remailer.  It
does not exist on a single host, but is rather the sum of a collection of
hosts running on widely seperated machines.  It has the same type of drawback
as a per-execution password entered into a long-lived process (anyone with
root access to the host can yank it out of memory with little difficulty,)
but this is spread out across a larger collection of hosts, making the task
of actually getting the complete password somewhat difficult.  Getting a
subset of the individual host passwords does not provide any partial
information about the collective password (similar to secret sharing.)
The other drawback is that certain operations can be very slow, you end
up emulating a circuit with a _very_ slow clock (8-10 Hz.  Not MHz, not KHz,
but 8-10 ticks/second); as compensation you get a word-size that if
effectively infinite. I have to continue work on a subset of these methods
for a secure digital poker/card-playing system over the next couple of months
and if I have some spare time I might see just how difficult creating a
toolkit for building such virtual circuits really is...

OTOH, a secure PCMCIA or smart-card will probably end up being a better
practical solution.
