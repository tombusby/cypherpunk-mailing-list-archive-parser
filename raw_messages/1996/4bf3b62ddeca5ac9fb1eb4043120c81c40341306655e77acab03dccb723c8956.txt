You clearly don't understand.  You are an ass making an assumption that a 
court cares or believes that the witness can actually produce the 
requested information or not.  Fines tend to be imposed regardless.

Contempt charges do operate world wide.  The reach of U.S. jurisdiction 
is very extensive and the United States generally doesn't care what the 
foreign jurisdiction thinks of it.

See my large note on asset concealing.

The same way no one creates Panamanian companies with their own name.  So 
what?  Third parties are still fined heavily.

And simpler for courts to fine them out of existance (which happened to 
several banks, trust companies and agents in Cayman and Panama).

They need only suspect or have reason to suspect it might be exculpatory.
Practically speaking this means convincing a judge.  Not hard when the 
words "offshore holding company" are mentioned in a brief or hearing.

In short, go to law school, then try to talk about legal issues.

Without getting into semantics, and "efficient identification system" 
implies one that identifies people efficently.  Blocking government use, 
or limiting it to certain circumstances is not efficiency.

Opinions are like assholes....

                                                                     ^^^^^^^

Hedge just a bit more and your argument will be completely underground.
