"Crypto Storm Warning"
Campaign Dispatch

by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 14 July 
   

   The Clinton administration escalated its cyber-fearstorm today when
   a top Justice Department lawyer slammed the Net for "transmitting
   child pornography into our homes" and for allowing hackers to possibly
   "shut down the banking system."

[...]
 
   At the same time, [Jamie] Gorelick edged away from the hard-line
   rhetoric the administration used to defend the Communications
   Decency Act.

[...]

   Gorelick's cybercondemnations play against a backdrop of political
   jockeying inside the Justice Department. Reno disclosed last November
   that she has Parkinson's disease, and Gorelick is her logical
   successor if Clinton stays in office next term.

[...]

   After Gorelick completed her speech and sat down, I leaned over and
   asked her: "Could I have your email address?"
   
   She didn't know it. "I don't go into it that often," Gorelick said,
   adding that the Justice Department doesn't use email much, for
   "security reasons." "Call me and I'll give it to you," she promised.
   
   Gosh, what a surprise: The US government's leading spokesperson on the
   dangers and the evils of the Net doesn't even log in.
