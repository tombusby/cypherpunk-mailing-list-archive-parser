This is the best way.  The message plus the signature should be encrypted
using a symmetric algorithm and encrypt the key with Alice's public key.
All RSA encryption and signing should be done according to the PKCS standard
to avoid several nasty attacks that are successful if plain RSA is used.

It is generally not a good idea to sign an encrypted message.  The signature
should be calculated on the plaintext, not ciphertext.

This has the same problem as #2.

SSLeay is pretty fast and does have code to use PKCS.  It probably doesn't make
that much of a difference.  RSAref isn't necessary; RSA isn't patented outside
the USA.  The other packages are faster and better than RSAref.
