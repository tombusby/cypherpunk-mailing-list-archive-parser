Maybe I misspoke; I wasn't referring to minting e-cash.  I was referring to
the fact that if you can get spammers to enclose a 20e coin for every junk
e-mail advertisement you agree to read, then you can write a mail reader
that will read their spam and collect all their 20e coins.  To me, that's
better than "minting" e-cash.  Totally legal, and the net effect transfers
funds from the spammers to me.

The rest of my letter was in regards to writing that mail reader.  And no,
even if they were to succeed at getting stupid users to install their own
special mail reader just for the privilege of reading their advertisements,
without secure hardware in the users' machines, their mail server would not
be secure against a spoofing attack.
