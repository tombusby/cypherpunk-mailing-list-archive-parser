I don't see a global agreement on GAK happening anytime soon. But that
doesn't mean that a less ambitious agreement can't be reached. Perhaps it
will come out of OECD, perhaps it will be limited to G-7. We will see an
agreement on GAK amongst the major players, with the exception of Japan.
After all, the players are faced with the same dilemma: how to best control
the behavior of their citizens.
