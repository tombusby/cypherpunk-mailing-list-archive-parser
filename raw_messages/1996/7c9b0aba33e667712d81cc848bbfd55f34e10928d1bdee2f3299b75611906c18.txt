I haven't accepted the original argument that A. Horowitz critiques. 
 
However, there appears to be at least two errors in his counter argument. 
 
1) Mr Anon is a real human being; the corporation is a legal fiction. Mr
Anon has a real head; the corporation does not. Mr. Anon has suffered a
real assault; the corporation has not. 
 
2) Mr Anon has a real use for his money. The original argument was, I
believe, that the tech etc. was appropriated in an area of the world where
no one could afford it, etc. As in: I write a book. I get money for it in
NYC where people buy it. I get mugged in NYC and my money is stolen. VERSUS
Soneone in an area of the world where my book is not sold makes a xerox
copy of the book. 
 
The crimes if crimes they be are not the same.

Naturally, I expect all the members of the Libertarian Party and the non-LP
libertarians who sent me e-mail and who posted to the list will post
similar things about this fallacy in logic, won't you. (Note to T.C. May:
This is not really sarcasm and not rhetorical hyperbole. It is more
"wishful thinking" on my part.

I believe the original quote from Proudhoun was "property is theft" but who
is counting. On the other hand, "2 + 2 = 4" and if my aunt had wheels and
ran down 5th Avenue she'd be a trolley. So what?
