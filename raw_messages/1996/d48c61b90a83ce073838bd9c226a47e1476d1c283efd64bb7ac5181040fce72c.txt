I got the following 'junk' email so I bit.  They asked for updated 
descriptions of software that I've thrown on the net, along with 
shareware/freeware/GPL/comm. ratings, etc.  Also violence ratings... 
I set all my source codes to "Gruesome" <insert cheesy emoticon here>

Interesting to see what proggies of mine they listed and what they 
didn't.

Dear Author,

We're building a public database called the "Developer's Directory" which
contains information about authors of shareware/freeware programs.
We'd like to include you and some information about your programs. 

We'd sure appreciate it if you'd visit our website and help
us fill in some info.

Since this system is still in the testing phase, we'd like to hear your
comments and suggestions.  Please send them to:
authors@pht.com

Thank you!
