C-punx,

Considering the amount of "preaching to the choir" that goes on here I
thought that the following news item might supply a more suitable outlet
for some of the more evangelical-minded Cypherpunks.  After all, it is
perfectly clear that the science of cryptography exemplifies some of the
more exciting applications of otherwise-dry mathematics, and there is
always a need for "voices of reason" in the councils of those who would
make the 'Net safe for children.

Tech Help for Schools

While high-tech education visionaries are issuing apocalyptic warnings
about the fate of the alledgedly backward US school system, a privately
sponsored group has launched a Peace Corps-style initiative to ease
schools into the 21st century.

The Massachusetts-based Tech Corps, which recruits volunteers to help
schools harness computers and telecommunications technology, announced
last month that it is going national.  The corps, whose chief sponsor is
the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, will hold a
conference in Washington DC on 30 October where people can learn how to
start state chapters.  Founded by Gary J. Beach, chief executive officer
of Computerworld Inc., the corps last year recruited 300 volunteers
theough the magazine Computerworld who have been working in 12 school
districts throughout Masachusetts.

Karen Smith, Tech Corps' national director, says the response to the call
for volunteers from people in industry, government agencies, and private
consulting firms, has been "incredible."  They help school districts in
any way they are asked - such as by installing wiring, training teachers,
persuading local industry to donate hardware, and helping schools
construct World Wide Web homepages.
