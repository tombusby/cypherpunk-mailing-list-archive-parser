        threatened by an airhead?!?   ROTFL

        ...reminds me of the man driving in the country with his blond
     bimbo, when they crest a hill and see YABB in the middle of a
    grazing field rowing a boat, ...absolutely oblivious to all else.
        our fearless BB demands her date stop as they pull abreast of
    the scene; our BB nimbly jumps from the car, runs to the fence
    line, and commences screaming at the YABB who is still rowing
    away with all her heart.
        BB, returning to the car, is asked by her date what she was 
    screaming at YABB.
        "Oh," BB said, "I was sooo mad!  I told her she was a disgrace
    to all blonde [bimbos]; ...and that if I could only swim, I would 
    come out there and thrash her..."

        Go on home, Deana; you have been in one more than too many
    intellectual arguments with only one oar and half the deck.
