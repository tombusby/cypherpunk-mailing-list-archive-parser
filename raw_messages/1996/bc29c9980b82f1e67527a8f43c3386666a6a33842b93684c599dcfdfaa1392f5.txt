The idea of putting together a CD with crypto stuff is an excellent
IDEA, and one which I very much welcome.

However a question .. are you (Ben) located in the US?  If so...

that rules out overseas buyers unless you fancy messing with ITAR...
Is it possible that you could come to some arrangement with some one
outside the ITAR fence who has a CD writer (any one reading have one?)
put together the same CD for those outside the US?
