In a earlier message I received from Adam I mistook his auto-remailers
scripts responce as a refusal to supply the afformentioned code. I apoligize
for my ignorance and retract any negative statements or implications that I
may have made.

In the last year I have had a couple of local business people and about a
dozen individuals ask about remailers and using PGP. I currently have a
couple of state political activists in the gun lobby who have begun using it
for internal communications. I am hoping to have another machine installed
in the next couple of weeks with mixmaster available. It is my intention to
run a remailer here in Texas with the help of the local cpunks (I hope) in
order to demonstrate what the technology is capable of. I see this script as
a major advance in making the software more palatable to the general
populace. My current business plan is to educate several international
translaters I work with about the technology. They work with foreign patents
being applied for here in the US and they typicaly must sign non-disclosure
agreements to get the contracts. Such technology may be something they find
useful.
