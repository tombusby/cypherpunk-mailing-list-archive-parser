                       CRYPTOGRAPHIC EXTENSIONS FOR PERL
                                       
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
                                  DESCRIPTION
                                       
   This library contains a suite of cryptographic extensions for Perl.
   Also included are some extensions that have a cryptographic relevance,
   such as the Compress::Zlib modules, and the TrulyRandom module.
   
   These modules have been developed as extensions for performance
   reasons.

   Now available for download at http://www.systemics.com/software/

   
                                   FEATURES
                                       
   All of the following have been implemented as Perl extensions in C:
     * BigInteger module (based on code from Eric Young). 
       This module implements arbitrary length integers and some
       associated mathematical functions.
     * Compress::Zlib module (by Paul Marquess).
       A Perl interface to Jean-loup Gailly's and Mark Adler's info-zip
       zlib compression library.
     * Crypt::DES module (DES implementation by Eric Young). 
     * Crypt::IDEA module. 
     * Crypt::MD5 module (by Neil Winton and Data Security, Inc.) 
     * Crypt::PRSG - Pseudo random sequence generator 
       This module implements a 160 bit LFSR for use in generating pseudo
       random sequences.
     * Crypt::SHA module (by Uwe Hollerbach and based on code from NIST
       and Peter C. Gutmann) 
     * Utils::TrulyRandom module, based on code from Don Mitchell and
       Matt Blaze (AT&T). 
       This module generates "truly random" numbers, based on interrupt
       timing discrepancies.
