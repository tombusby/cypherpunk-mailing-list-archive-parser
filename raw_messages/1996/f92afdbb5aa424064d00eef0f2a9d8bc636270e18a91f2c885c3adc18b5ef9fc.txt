I just wrote and sent off to the list some thoughts on using cheap PC
hardware to do the crypto and remailer functions, thus taking the onus off
the networked box to do the same.

The idea of a _card_ is a good one, and one we did in fact kick around a
couple of years ago. Recall the days of the "Hardcard"? A Winchester
mounted on a card that plugged into a PC slot (this was back in the days
when slots for cards were sometimes much more available than spare drive
bay slots).

A crypto card is an elegant approach, but may be less hacker-available than
a really cheap PC. (And in my more paranoid moments, I imagine taking a
nice, steel-cased cheapo PC and welding it shut...won't stop someone from
seizing it and cutting it open, but you'd probably know if it
happened...or, a return to sealing wax and seal rings! A low-tech solution
to physical security, but something that may still be useful as an option.)
