Can't you just run a dumb TCP relay? 

I used to have one somewhere, but I can't remember if I solarified it to 
run with multi-threading. I can try and dig it up, but it'd probably be 
faster for you to rewrite from scratch. I also have a ssl proxy for the 
client side which I wrote to demo the MITM attack, but that doesn't sound 
like what you need.

They say in  online country             So which side are you on boys
There is no middle way                  Which side are you on
You'll either be a Usenet man           Which side are you on boys
Or a thug for the CDA                   Which side are you on?
