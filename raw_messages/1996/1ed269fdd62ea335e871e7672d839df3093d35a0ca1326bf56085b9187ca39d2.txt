Wow, I'm going to miss cypherpunks. I didn't post much, but I've always
been an avid reader (sniff). If I only had it to do all over again...
Oh, by the way, since you're planning on doing away with things, could you 
get rid of some of these outfits that do the mass e-mails, thanks in advance.

I find you're martial arts reference very interesting. But if you were truly
any good, you wouldn't be waving it in everyones face like a banner. I find
your demeanor to be that of someone that has never practiced the warrior
arts. If you had, you'd have developed more respect for your fellow human
beings. 
        I'm guessing you're a very lonely person, whos only way of getting
attention is to try and cause a conflict. Share your pain with us, and
together we'll grow stronger ( Star Trek reference ;)). But if you can't do
that, shut 
off your computer ( or leave your terminal), and go find someone to talk to,
like a counselor.
