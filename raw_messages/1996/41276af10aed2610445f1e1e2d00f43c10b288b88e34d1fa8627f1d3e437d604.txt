Obviously, there aren't any. (Being an outraged cypherpunk in the PRC
would no-doubt be harmful to the outraged cypherpunk's health.)

I think that the goal here is to try to generate just one small group of
cypherpunks in Hong Kong, who plan to stay on after the occupation. They
will necessarily be very brave people, but IMO brave people _are_ there.
I won't say bravery of that sort is common, but there are many people
in China, and we all remember the guy who stood there in front of the
tank...IMO remailer technology transfers will be _at least_ as important
to this [admittedly ambitious] goal as direct crypto transfers are, as
traffic-analysis is _VERY useful_ to the surveilance state. When the
"remailer-in-a-box" is finished by a friend of mine "Real Soon Now" (tm)
I hope that the directions to it are translated and that it is widely
distributed [legally, of course]. ;)

Tim, you're giving up too quickly on most of the rest of the planet.
As long as repression ever works somewhere, statists will attempt to
(selectively) use annoying examples of how "orderly" it makes life.

It's a one-way ratchet: When a moron bombs a building here, the US
politicians cancel a repeal of the "assault weapons" ban. When some
moron plants a bomb in London (or Paris) their politicians' reaction
is not exactly the reverse...

I think that these statistics are likely correct, but I think it's not
important, and we can't just give up this easily...We already know that
China will be swallowing Hong Kong, a haven of capitalism, and IMHO we
should work to make this process as "interesting" as possible. Anonymity
is likely to upset the Chinese authorities as much as it upset the CO$.

I know nobody in Hong Kong who will be staying, but I'm sure that some
people on this list do, and Hong Kong is likely to be a better place for
us to "infiltrate" than Beijing. Time is short, but if the fax machine
gave us Tienanmen(sp?) I am optimistic about e-mail. Singapore residents
(at least, those with a hankering for chewing-gum) might feel they have
a reason to help us, if we simply try to be polite when we ask for help
in putting together a good-looking Trojan Horse.
