A double-edged quote, isn't it?

[Tim's sort-of techie comments deleted.]

Who needs high-tech for a surveillance state? I remember several 
years back a Soviet-history class that put a lot of emphasis on the 
Czar's totalitarian regime, much of which was already in place when 
the Bolshviks took power (and one of the reasons they held it).
Irregardless of the literacy rate (which I'm guessing was low 
anyway), it was apparently common practice in many European countries 
in the early 19th century (incl. Russia) to have 'black offices' in the post 
offices that would steam open EVERY piece of mail to be read for 
intelligence and surveillance purposes.  And back then there was 
probably a higher proportion of meaningful mail since there was no 
telephone, radio, or (very little) direct-mail marketing.  Generally 
such offices were used for political purposes.  Oddly enough the 
secret police organizations spied heavily on those in power as well: 
sometimes I wonder if Americal political scandals are (or will ever be) 
linked to US intelligence agencies listening in one some pol's calls.

This is akin in some ways to building a postal system where there's a
black office in every station.
