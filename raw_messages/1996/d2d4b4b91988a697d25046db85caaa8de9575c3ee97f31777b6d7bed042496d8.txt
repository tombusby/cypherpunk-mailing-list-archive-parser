Priority: normal


dear folks,

you know where your priorities are. 

So let's vote



A group of NEO-NAZIS are trying to form a newsgroup on
Usenet called "rec.music.white-power", so that they can get their
message of hate out to young people using the Internet.
Newsgroups are public discussions on the Internet and their
formation requires enough support from the Internet community.
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US HAS ONE VOTE when it comes
to creating a new Usenet group.  I hope you will vote NO and
thereby tell these NAZIS we don't want their stuff on the net.
Below is the procedure, please repost this plea and get the NO vote
out.  If you want to see the official call for votes, you can try on
"news.group".
            DO NOT VOTE TWICE - that would constitute voting fraud. 
            
HOW TO VOTE:
     Send e-mail (posts to newsgroups are invalid) to:
     music-vote@sub-rosa.com
     This is an impartial, third party vote taker.
     Please check the address before you mail your vote. Your mail
     message,  to be accepted by the counting computer,  must
     contain only the following statement with no signature:

     I vote NO on rec.music.white-power

     Vote counting is automated.  Failure to follow these directions 
may mean that your vote does not get counted.  If you do not receive
an acknowledgment of your vote within three days contact the
votetaker about the problem.  It's your responsibility to make sure
your vote is registered correctly.
    Here's what Canada's George Burdi, of the neo-Nazi Heritage Front, 
had to say about this vote, on February 21, on his RESISTANCE
mailing list:
   "There is a call for votes coming on rec.music.white-power
   in the next week or so, and you will be notified in a special
   issue of RREN exactly what to do.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS
   TO THE LETTER.  Let me be perfectly blunt and state that we
   have more than enough net-nazis to win this thing handsdown. But 
   every one of you must vote YES!  And just voting    yes means 
   nothing unless you do it properly.  So you have   been forewarned.  
   The instructions are coming to your email  box soon, and they are
   not complicated.  Just follow them as told, and we will have a WP
   music newsgroup finally!
     If Mr. Burdi's confidence disturbs you, please give this letter 
the widest possible distribution, and help us deliver the largest NO 
vote in the history of the UseNet.
