Its difficult to know what the US definition of "socialism" is.
Particularly
on Cypherpunks. I would consider it reasonable to call Thatcher a
statist
and authoratarian which many on the list consider to be the definition
of socialism.

I would prefer to have the ecconomic figures for any European country
over
those of the UK. At the start of the Conservative rule the UK was the 
second biggest ecconomy. Today we have just been overtaken by Spain.
Italy and France overtook long ago.

With the exception of the UK the politics in Europe are much more left
wing than those of the states. Excluding Major there is no European
head of government to the right of Clinton. Its not really a case of 
"too socialist" as the natural rotation of power amongst the parties.
