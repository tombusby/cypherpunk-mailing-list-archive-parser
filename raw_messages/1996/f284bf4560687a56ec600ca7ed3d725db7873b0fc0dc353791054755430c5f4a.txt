Not just this, but another data point about the current sentiment about
Washington: In a movie theater today there was a preview of the upcoming
movie "Independence Day," showing a flying saucer hovering over the White
House, then destroying it. The audience cheered and clapped.

I'm not sure this would've happened in, say, the early 1950s.

(However, like the early 1950s, the producers of this upatriotic drivel may
have to answer to the House Un-American Activities Committee, to explain
their Indecent portrayal.)

(P.S. "Broken Arrow" was a fun flick. Sort of like "Fail Safe " on "Speed.")
