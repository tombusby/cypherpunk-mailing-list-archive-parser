Then you still have the problem of the connection of the exceedingly thin 
tube to your starfish/wagon wheel where the individual tubes branch off 
to the compressive explosive assembly.  This puts you right back to 
square one, the need to mill these connections with exceedingly close 
tolerances.

Considering that you never discussed the specifics of blasting caps or 
the manner in which they might influence your design, I think the safe 
assumption is that you never thought of it.  Your paragraph above is poor 
spin control in that regard.

This is name dropping.  The reader will notice the need to bolster 
credibility by association with a "big" name.  The conclusions are obvious.

The reader will notice now how the author has gone from associating with 
the "big" name to being superior to the "big" name.  The intent is to 
bolster holed credibility even further.  This tactic will be recognized 
by the astute political observer as "link and exceed."  (Most often used 
with our favorate "big" name, JFK.

Without more on your shape and size of the core, its essentially 
impossible to say what timing difference will be debilitating.  I did 
infact give an example related to fractions of the branch tube lengths.  
Without more from you, the supposed originator of the idea, no one can 
tell you how much timing error is enough.  The answer in general form 
is:  Enough to cause the center shape to displace enough of it's mass 
away from the direct brunt of force from the opposed charge.  Most 
excessively, some of the branch tubes might fail to initiate all 
together.  The quantity of all this depends so specifically on the type of 
explosive used for the compression, the exact density of your core, the 
number of facets you use in your compressive assembly and the location of 
initiation on the facets so as to be entirely useless without precise 
details.  What I can tell you is that it's enough of a problem to make 
high speed precise switches necessary.  Be real, if the timing problem 
was enough to make even normal resistance matching a problem, how the 
hell are you going to solve it with a much more volitle and violent 
initiation method?

I did that with the example related to tube length. (Which you quite 
cleverly deleted)  I'm hardly going to sit down and do models of shaped 
explosive dynamics and hydraluic shock analysis simply to tell you 
you're way off.  If your so interested, examine the problem yourself.

What you were and are aware of is a matter for significant speculation, 
complicated by your characterization of shape charge analysis (especially 
with liquid explosive) as "rudimentary analysis."

But since you haven't tested it, and don't plan to, we can't know can 
we?  Moreover, since your design was only marginally if ever interested 
in these problems, one has to assume you're way off the ball.  Your 10ns 
accuracy figure is pulled right out of the air and in no way represents a 
figure you know you can obtain.  I don't believe such accuracy can be 
obtained with this kind of physical inititation.  I'm not telling you to 
stop trying, you can do what you like.  I will, however, expose your 
oversights in order to facilitate reputation capital distribution by the 
list.  (To which I now apologize for the massive spam).

Oh, whatever.  Get a grip.  These paranoid rantings intended to deflect 
and distract from the main failings in your design are more than obvious.

No, they are just the simpliest liquid explosives to obtain and make, and 
happen to have the highest detonation velocities.  I assumed you would be 
using them.  Perhaps I overestimated the depth of your thought on this 
matter.

When I make them, I admit them.

As I said before, the degree of your expertise and wisdom is the primary 
issue in debate.
