Netscape would be a great choice as well - the Internet security market is
*very* important.  Microsoft has publically said that their cash flow model
will work if they make NOTHING off of internet software of any sort.  Compare
this with the fortunes being spent on "Netscape Enterprise Server" or the
like.   They could issue press releases talking about how they have the
software to keep your VISA secure but the USG isn't allowing them to use it!

Microsoft would probably do anything the USG asked if, say, immunity from the
DOJ was granted under the table.

NTT is also a great choice, as you mentioned above.

IBM, Sun, DG, Cray (a Silicon Graphics subsidiary?), etc. might go for some
free publicity - I've seen a LOT of press releases out of IBM that talk about
"blue-sky" research being done.   Given that IBM lives because of big
business, they also have a demonstratable interest.   I'm sure they'd love to
be able to advertise that the data you trust to DB2 (for instance) is
entirely secure.   The same argument works for DG.  Also, IBM has a lot
invested in chip fabrication facilities - there's got to be some extra
capacity there! Sun has always seemed to be big on tech-demo type things. 
Cray - well that's obvious.  The supercomputer market is heading toward
massive parallelism.  Leaching time looks interesting!
