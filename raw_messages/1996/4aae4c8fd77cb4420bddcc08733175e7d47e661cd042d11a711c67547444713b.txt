	A fully anonymous individual (not a pseudonym or otherwise
trackable individual) is inevitably going to have a reputation of 0.
It can't be negative; that would be saying that I could flame myself via
remailers and _increase_ my reputation if I did it properly. The person
can't exactly build up a reputation of above 0, since that would require
multiple good postings and/or some form of escrow.
