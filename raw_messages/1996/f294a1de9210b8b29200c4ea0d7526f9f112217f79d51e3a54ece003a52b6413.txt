What about the French Foreign Legion? or the Volunteers for Israel,
which isn't really a fighting force, but Americans can help keep
the Israeli army at a ready state.

Depends on what you would qualify as being mercenary work, Would Americans
working on North Sea oil platforms getting paid $70,000+ a year tax free
be considered a mercenary? Or going down to the islands and opening a
data haven? Or maybe being the engineer for the Sultan of Brunei?

Marketing and advertising has always been mercenary work for as long
as I have been in it, Ask any number of freelancers who have been
slogging it out in the trenches.
