Careful, the FBI only does counter-intel in this context.

Again, why was the FBI putting the informant into Intel?  It was almost
100% certain to be related to a criminal or counter-intel matter.  The
fact that the informant may have appropriated information in the process
and sold it to the highest bidder is a rebuke against the FBI's informant
selection process, not against economic or industrial espionage, which the
FBI does not do.

It has gained a great deal of notice, you just have to know where to look.
I suggest looking over e.g., the economist, foreign affairs, foreign
policy, the international journal of intelligence and counterintelligence,
signal....

I don't think you have a firm grasp on the role or part the FBI took in
this matter.

Typically this is with the consent of the companies, or in response to
complaints from same.  This is COUNTER intelligence, not espionage or
"ecspionage" (A silly and non-sensical term even if you were constructing
it correctly here).

See my comment above.

Not the first time, certainly will not be the last.  Again, it's a
question of procedure, not of the validity of the program.

I believe you mean economic intelligence here, not economic espionage, or
industrial espionage, or "ecspionage."

Try to be more careful about the roles of the various parties in your
(otherwise interesting) commentary.
