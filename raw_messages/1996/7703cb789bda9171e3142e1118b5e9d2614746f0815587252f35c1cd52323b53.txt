Well the first DH parameter set (in a series of re-keyed DH
parameters) could just as easily go in the public key block.  If you
were not doing rekeying, it would make sense to put the public DH
parameters in the key block, as it would remove the need to negotiate
these parameters, and simplify the protocol.  As you're doing
rekeying, putting the parameters in the public key block makes a less
orthogonal protocol, adds nothing, and has the negative effect of
breaking compatibility with previous public key blocks.  In short for
a rekeying protocol I agree :-)

Fair enough.

I suspected RSAs weird license might be the problem.  (Given the
situation with PGP 2.x, I presume that the license does not permit you
to increase the max arithmetic precision.)

Each remailer with it's own prime doesn't buy you a whole lot of
entropy because there aren't many mixmaster remailers, 4 bits
currently?.  The entropy from having rekeying every day instead of say
every year, another 9 bits, 13 bits tops?  I'm not sure what the
precise entropy increase is from going to 1024 to 4096, but it's got
to be many orders of magnitude better than 13 bits.

I'd say junk RSAREF for the DH operations, use one of the other libs.
(You can do this for DH, without violating patents, right?  But not
for RSA, so I guess if you care about the patent/license agreement
mess, you've got to use RSAREF for RSA signatures at least).  Or maybe
you could just wait for PGP 3.0 which uses El Gamal, for sigs and pk
encryption, and presumably will have less restrictive key sizes.

So as well as having bigger signing keys, for the sake of paranoia
(it's contagious), as you were saying, I guess you may gain some
security by not having a common modulus, and making the protocol allow
re-keying.

If you used a different password for RSA and DH keys, and your machine
is compromised, you can sign a new DH key with RSA, and use El Gamal
signatures with the DH key normally.  Hows that for paranoid :-)

(Or another temporary RSA key, and RSA sigs, rather than El Gamal
sigs, whatever.  You sign by proxy, that is the receiver mixmaster
gets a the temporary key signed by the long term RSA key, checks the
signature on the temporary key, and then checks the signature made by
the temporary key on the object in question).

Greatly reduces the risk of having the password in the binary.  You'd
need to manually type the RSA keys password to rekey, or if you were
real paranoid, you could keep the RSA key on your laptop, and copy the
new signed DH public key on to the remailer.  Do this once a month, or
as often as you wish.

This is a similar approach to that taken by people who have a huge
signing only PGP key, which they are careful to keep only on machines
they physically control, and have smaller keys which they use on
multi-user systems.

This also formalizes the situation where remailers have been
compromised, or suffered disk crashes.  The operator says, "sorry
folks new type2 key for mixmaster@xyz.org", and if you're lucky signs
his post, and also his post of the original key, so that you know it's
not a hijacker, and if you're even more lucky, the user was around
when the first post was made, or searches through the archives for it,
and checks that the sigs show a persistent identity for the operator.
An improvement right?  The remailers keep both their signing keys, and
their temporary signing keys available by request, the signing key
should not change through the remailers life-time.

yeah, ok, I agree no common modulus.  And rekeying.

sounds fine.

Also, you might want to migrate to SHA1 in place of MD5, at some
point.  Or to one of those megahashes like

	SHA1(MD5(x))||MD5(SHA1(x))

Also mixmaster has capabilities like type 1 remailers right?  If so
you would presumably add a capability indicating that the remailer
supports direct socket delivery.  And another capability for forward
secrecy (the other thread "non-interactive forward secrecy" discusses
ways to retro-fit a less interactive forward secrecy mechanism into
email delivered mixmaster packets).

The socket capability presumably would be useful to know that it is
likely to react more quickly.  Forward secrecy is obviously nice to
know about for other reasons.
