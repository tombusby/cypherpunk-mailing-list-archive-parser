While I agree we shouldn't push the crypto/arms connection, on the other 
hand I think we can push BACK:  If the government tries to equate crypto 
with arms,take the position that while we disagree with this equation, to 
the extent the government is using it, it must take the good with the bad 
and accept the "keep and bear arms" interpretation literally.
