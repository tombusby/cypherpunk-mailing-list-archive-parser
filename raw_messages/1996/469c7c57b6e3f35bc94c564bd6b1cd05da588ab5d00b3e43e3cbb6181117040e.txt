The Challenge

To claim the $10,000 in NET's Firewall Challenge, individuals must 
first
register with NET, then use a computer to break into NET's secure
transaction server and retrieve information stored there about paper
currency totaling $10,000, namely: (1) the number of notes, (2) the
denomination of each note and (3) the serial number of each note.
The first person to supply the correct information to NET between
12:01 a.m. May 1 and 12:01 a.m. May 31 will win the $10,000.

In the case of multiple break-ins, the first person sending the
correct information to NET's e-mail address will be declared the
winner. Participants must be individuals over 18 years of age, not
companies, and must also agree to surrender to NET all relevant
information about the methods they used to break through the firewall.

Further details on the Network Engineering Technologies' $10,000
Firewall Challenge available on the World-Wide Web at 
http://thefirewall.com
or by writing NET at 1714 Ringwood Ave., San Jose, CA 95131.
