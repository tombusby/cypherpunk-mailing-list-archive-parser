I do not mind being trolled from time to time. 
 
Based on my anthropological, political, and journalistic researches, I look
at cypherpunks as a heterogeneous, not homogenous, movement. By this, I
mean that it can be examined in a variety of ways based on significantly
different points. 
 
1) Development (more accurately spread) of public key crypto: definitely
vanguard. 
 
2) Development and spread of anon remailers: definitely vanguard. 
 
3) Opposition to CDA, etc.: Part of a smallish mass movement. Participation
in the movement definitely limited to a small number of issues involved.
E.G. good contributions to publicity; no contribution to issues of mass
sexual hysteria around "kiddie porn," etc. 
 
4) Other issues, like future role of e-cash, etc. Not vanguard, not mass
movement, a "bunch of loons."
