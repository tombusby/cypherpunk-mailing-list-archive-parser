I think we differ on the definition of "unbreakable".  A quick stab at my
(admittedly very vague) definition includes the inability of the analyst to
determine (by the structure of the plaintext) that he has a correct
decryption.

When I look in AC2, Schneier uses "break" in many ways.  Let me evaluate
OTP against his taxonomy of attacks:

Ciphertext-only:   Unbreakable
Known-plaintext:   Unbreakable, since the pad is never reused
Chosen-plaintext:  Unbreakable, ditto
Adaptive-chosen-plaintext: Unbreakable, ditto
Chosen-ciphertext: This attack doesn't seem to apply
Chosen-key:        This attack requires that the OTP doesn't have 
                   1-bit-of-entropy/bit which implies it isn't an OTP.
Rubber-hose:       Since any decryption is equally plausable, OTPs are
                   resistant to this attack.  OTOH, it means they may 
                   keep beating you even after you've given them the
                   correct decryption.
Purchase-key:      This attack seems the only way to break an OTP.
 
If you accept Purchase-key as a valid attack, and it certainly has worked
in many real-life situations, then no system is "unbreakable" and there is
not any point in using the term.  If you leave it out of the valid forms of
attack, because all systems are vulnerable to it so it doesn't help in
selecting a cryptosystem, then the OTP is "unbreakable".

How do you want to define "unbreakable"?
