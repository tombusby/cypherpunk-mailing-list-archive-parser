Oh do be quiet you self satisfied smug little man.


Every single member of this list and indeed of other forums in which 
you post (I don`t know of any but I assume it is not just us you 
annoy) knows you are a fool.

Some while ago I seem to recall you offering to sell your company for 
one dollar if anyone could break your last algorithm, it was sumarily 
broken - why are you still owner of the company? - Oh I get it, they 
wouldn`t pay a dollar for it, neither would I. But seriously, was 
this you, and why didn`t you sell the company, and how are people to 
trust you now knowing this past debacle...

Go away, you are like an unpopular bore at a party who doesn`t seem 
to realise that everyone wants him to leave....
