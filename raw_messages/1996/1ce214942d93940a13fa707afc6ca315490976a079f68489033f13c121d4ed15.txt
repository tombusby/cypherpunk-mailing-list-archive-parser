I was mistaken, and I now think it's a spoof, not a hack, but regardless 
it's a good anti-Clinton site, although still the best IMO is:

http://www.realchange.org/index.htm

Real People For Real Change, a non-affiliated, independent political
action committee with nothing nice to say about *anyone*.
                      ^^^^^^^
[I played a small part in convincing them to say bad things about Browne(!) 
on the theory that bad press is better than no press at all.]

Following notes on a Browne-campaign staff -- National Party staff 
conflict-of-interest, the Real Changers say:

"This being the Libertarians, other people argued that the other campaigns 
should have hired them, too!"

To know us is to love us, especially if you are the highest bidder.
