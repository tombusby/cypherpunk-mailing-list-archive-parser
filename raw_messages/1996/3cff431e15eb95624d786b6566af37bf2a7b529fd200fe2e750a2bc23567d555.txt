This is horrible.  If you have to ship the original untouched picture to 
someone, the man in the middle attack will work, furthermore, the image 
you use is likely already out there and when you ship the modified 
version to XOR, the man in the middle will be able to get the two.

Basically your idea gets back to the original key distribution problem 
that PK schemes have solved... if you have to use a secure channel to 
send a passphrase along, why not use that same channel for the message as 
well?

There are other ways to do this and NOT have it detected.  See my 
WNS210.ZIP package. :^)  (Shameless, plug, but hey, better secure than 
sorry.)

Now if I can find a way to get WNStorm to be somehow mind-melded with PGP 
and produce a public key Stego system, that would be worth the trouble. :)

[This Bible excerpt awaiting review under the Communications Decency Act]
And then Lot said, "I have some mighty fine young virgin daughters. Why
don't you boys just come on in and do em right here in my house - I'll just
watch!"....Later, up in the mountains, the younger daughter said. "Dad's
getting old. I say we should do him." So the two daughters got him drunk and
did him all that night. Sure enough, Dad got em pregnant....Onan really
hated the idea of doing his brother's wife and getting her pregnant while
his brother got all the credit, so he whacked off first....Remember, it's
not a good idea to have sex with your sister, your brother, your parents,
your pet dog, or the farm animals. [excerpts from the Old Testament, Modern
Vernacular Translation, TCM, 1996]
