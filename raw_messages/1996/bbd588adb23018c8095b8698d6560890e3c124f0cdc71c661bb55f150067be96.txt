Somebody censored the header in this article,
and we put it back.  You know, that is the worst
kind of censorship, when somebody attempts to avoid the issue.

This whole case started with Vulis who is heterosexual vs.
John Gilmore who is homosexual.  The fact is that homosexuals
must not be allowed to have any "control" priveleges on this
Internet any more.

The question is, does this John Gilmore really take it
up the ass?  Whether or not he is a FAGGOT is a very relevant issue
here, and it must not be overlooked.

Anyone exercising any attempts at "control" are giving justified
reason for their immediate elimination.
