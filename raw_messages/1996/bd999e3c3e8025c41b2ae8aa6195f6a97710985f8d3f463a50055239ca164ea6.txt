Thanks for an interesting paper.

In part " V.Code (Security Issues)/3.Data Checking" you say the following:

`` Data coming in to Acme Widgets should be checked very carefully for
        appropriateness. This check should be to see if the data is what
        is expected (length, characters). Making a list of bad
        characters is not the way to go; the lists are rarely complete.
        A secure program should know what it expects, and reject other
        input. (For example, if you are looking for an email address,
        don't check to see if it contains a semi-colon or a newline,
        check to see if it contains anything other than a [A-Za-z0-9._]
        followed by an @, followed by a hostname [A-Za-z0-9._].)''
END QUOTE

That is not entirely correct. An email address is much more than
that, it can contain "!", several "@" characters (not next to each other
though), "%", and so on. x400 mail addresses (?) can contain "/", "=",
and all emails can have "+" and "-" and "_" in them. 

Some of the valid email addresses are

user_name@company.com
alex+@pitt.edu
mi%aldan.UUCP@algebra.com
user%host.domain@anon.penet.fi
host1!host2!user

Look at your sendmail.cf file for a humongous amount of 
email parsing rules.

Thanks for an excellent document though, I put a link to it from my
intranet page.
