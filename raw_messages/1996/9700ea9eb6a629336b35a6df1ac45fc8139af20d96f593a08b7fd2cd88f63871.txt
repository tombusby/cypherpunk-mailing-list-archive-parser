Bryce, we've differed several times before about the web of trust,
especially "man-in-the-middle" issues. This looks to be the same sort of
issue.

I personally don't see key-signings as mainly useful for verifying the
"true name" of someone whose key I sign. (I don't check birth certificates,
passports, driver's licenses, etc.)

Rather, I view _my_ key signings as forms of vouching, or endorsement. Not
of all views, naturally, but as a statement that the person whose key I am
signing is someone I know and "trust" (in the sense that the key belongs to
the person I "know." Thus, I know Eric Hughes, even though he may actually
be Fritz Kacynski, drop-out math student.

Sure, he could do it. I'm saying that there's also a significant chance he
has no black friends or no blacks he deals with on a regular enough basis
to even be _asked_ to "vouch" for them, much less _agree_ to sign their
keys.

(This is the way it really does work in the real world, at least for many
of us. People who ask me to sign their keys from afar will get no response
from me. I don't even care if they fax me their birth certificates, etc.
Only people I have met or interacted with directly, or who seem to be known
by enough of my friends, get their keys signed.)

Now I can certainly see other folks signing keys on a different basis: upon
presentation of a valid passport, comparison of footprint with that on
birth certificate, etc. Such "credentialling agencies" will be valuable
players (to some) in the ecosystem of key-signers.

I'm just saying that I'm certainly not in the business of checking
credentials for free, and hence only sign keys for people I know fairly
well, or who know my own friends fairly well.

Bryce, I respect your views on this and MITM issues, but the fact that we
view things differently (and that Phil Z. views things differently from
you, and perhaps from me) should not always be ascribed by you as
"reflecting lack of understanding."

Well, I wrote up my thoughts on how work on "belief networks" is less
confusing that the term "web of trust."

I believe different agents will use these belief networks in different
ways. Some will be focused on the issue of True Names and will calculate
beliefs on the basis of how much they think the key-signers are being
diligent enough in checking identities. Others will use belief networks to
convey trust that one is not a government agent (a practical example being
the use of PGP and webs of trust in the jungles of Burma, where I am quite
sure the "keyrings" did not deliberately include government agents,
regardless of how well they "proved" their identity!

There is no single ontological interpretation of belief networks.
