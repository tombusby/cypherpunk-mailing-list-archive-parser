>FCC BOOSTS PROSPECT FOR SUPERNETS
>The Federal Communications Commission may reserve a band of radio
>frequencies to allow free and unlicensed transmissions at 25 megabit speeds
>of large volumes of data within a group of buildings.  These so-called
>"supernet" wireless services, which would operate at no more than one watt
>of power in order to avoid interfering with neighboring supernets, could
>then be connected by high-speed phone lines to the Internet, thus largely
>bypassing local phone companies to get Net access.  (New York Times 25 Apr
>96 C1)

	If these are not covered by the regulations against encryption in
the use of packet radio, this would seem to be an opening for such. Indeed,
encryption of radio messages would appear to be rather critical for security.

>HARDWARE SOLUTION TO E-COMMERCE SECURITY
>VLSI Technology and Tandem Computer's Atalla are developing chip-level
>security products to protect electronic transactions over the Internet and
>intranets.  The products will incorporate DES, RSA and other encryption
>technology, and the companies hope their joint venture will establish a
>hardware-based security standard for electronic commerce.  (Information Week
>15 Apr 96 p34)

>INTERNET PHONE FACES REGULATORY FIGHT
>The Canadian communications regulatory agency says companies offering online
>phone services must pay a fee to local phone companies to help keep local
>phone rates low.  ShadowTel, the small Ontario company which recently
>announced it planned to offer telephone service on the  Internet, appears
>headed toward a fight with federal regulators over whether it must pay a
>special fee to Canada's phone companies.  (Toronto Globe & Mail 25 Apr 96 B10)
