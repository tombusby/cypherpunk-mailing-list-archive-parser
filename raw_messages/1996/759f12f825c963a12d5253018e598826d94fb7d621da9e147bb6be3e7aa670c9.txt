Why bother with explosives when you can pull a manhole cover and climb down
with a <insert power tool of choice here, I prefer the chainsaw myself>. All
that copper/fiber has to run somewhere in the area to get into the buildings.
When the conductor is gone say goodnight. Or the alternative, pour gas into
the access covers and light it. Simple is better.

        Short of a tac nuke there won't be one any time soon. The
herf/emp/sci-fi weapon of choice is not feasible *at this time*. Remember
the square law. If it isn't in the machine room, or damn close it won't
work. One has to wonder why the assorted experts on this haven't built a
working model and given a controlled demonstration.

While the consultants are hypeing all this I have REAL threats to deal with.

P.S. I guess I'm going to have to get Eudora Pro so I can filter out the
psychos 'R' us persona.
