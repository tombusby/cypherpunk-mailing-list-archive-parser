(4) Have a machine responsible for generating the public-private keys for
each node.  It has its own public-private key pair.  It uses it's private
key to sign each node's public key.  Every node gets three keys: it's
public and private keys, and the public key generating machine.

When nodes make contact they exchange signed public keys and verify the
signature of their partner's key with the public key of the generating
machine.

This is a simple certificate hierarchy scheme as seen in SET, the US Post
Office CA system, and VeriSign.  Note that the generating machine does not
need to be on any network.  In fact, it could spend most of its time locked
up in a safe since it is only needed when generating new keys.
