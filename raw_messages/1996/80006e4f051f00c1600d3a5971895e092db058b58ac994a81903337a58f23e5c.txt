What you are essentially doing is buying reputation I guess, although I
am not familiar with completion bonds, so I the following is mostly
conjecture on their nature.

There are two major feature/bugs with the completion bond.  Firstly, it
requires the bonding company to make a judgement, and this adds a weak
point into the link.  That judgement will then result in a lot of
emphasis on the fine print of the contract, and fundamentally, software
doesn't work very well when fine print gets involved.  The notion of
"completion" especially sits oddly with the scenario described, where
freeware of mostly source form gets distributed to a wide group of
programmers who can adjust minor problems fairly easily.  I would guess
that when EDS delivers a product, there are completion ("penalty")
clauses, but when the Internet was "delivered" there was no such clause.

Secondly, the existance of an intermediary points to a major
inefficiency in the market.  Whilst your joy at paying intermediaries
may vary, historically, intermediaries follow a pattern of building
barriers to entry, raising charges, and slowing innovation.  This is
theory that is generally applicable in practice, and it is for this
reason that the emphasis in my post was on removing the single point of
guaruntee.  In the context, I would also question the nature of a
financial entity that was willing to sell its reputation to
cryptoanarchists.

By aiming for no single point of judgement, the only solution that we
found was to rely on a multi-shot game, with past reputation leading to
up-front payment leading to confirmation of reputation.  As it happens,
the bonding companies will rely heavily on reputation as well, in its
varying forms, anyway.

Yes, I saw that earlier post, and did a quick search for it but no
luck.  If any one can point us at the paper, that would be useful.

On a slightly related note - is there any interest in setting up a
mailgroup for programmers and designers of markets?  There's plenty of
cash stuff out there but I know of no forums for trading of fungible
items.
