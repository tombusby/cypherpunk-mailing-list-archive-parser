I get most of my information in this area from Photonics Spectra magazine, 
and Laser Focus World magazine.

No, Clay, I did not say that the flesh RADIATED near IR. (it does, but only 
a very tiny amount.)  The identification system I describe would probably 
use 940 nm IRLEDs to illuminate the face, and a silicon CCD detector to pick 
up the images.  Or it would use ambient near-IR, perhaps from the sun or a 
tungsten filament or fluorescent lighting, along with an IR filter to ensure 
that the CCD camera picked up only the IR bands of interest.  It would be 
easy to check out the results:  Put such an IR-passing filter in front of a 
CCD-based camcorder, and take a picture of somebody.

Incidentally, this simplicity shows the flaw in using this kind of system as 
an identifier:  Since people's faces are usually visible, and can be 
photographed in the near-IR surreptitiously, it isn't clear how to prevent 
faking a face which appears to have the same IR signature and pattern.
