No, it's not really the accountability that's the issue.  It's the
ability to choose before the fact that I 'trust' the software's author.

Yup, point well taken.  <story user=clueless>I popped into an empty users 
cube last week to borrow the phone.  On the monitor was a post-it note from
one of his co-workers that read, 'Please write your password here:' and of

Shh... we have enough kool dewds floating around here looking for ideas.

I agree 100%.  The intent of my comments was that such security *is* 
possible, but it's not available in widely deployed mass-market OS's.
I'd love to hear feedback to the contrary, but it seems to me that it's
extremely difficult to layer that type of security onto an existing system.
