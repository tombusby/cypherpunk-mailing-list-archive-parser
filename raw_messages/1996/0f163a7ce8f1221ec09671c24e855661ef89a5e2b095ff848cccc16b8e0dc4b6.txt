Nor am I.
Most accounts during the period where the above incidents caused problems
were opened by proxy then transfered repeatedly.  The use of Swiss
"passbook" accounts in collecting kidnapping randsome was epidemic in the
1970s and 1980s.  These accounts, as they are bearer based and opened
through proxy, were entirely anonymous.

Many examples of effectively and literally anonymous accounts existed in
the 1970s and 1980s.

BCCI was famous for not caring who the account holder was, and shell
corporations were shamelessly used to conceal deposit taking and account
management by depositors who weren't satisified with trusting BCCI's
reputed "disinterest."

Again, Mr. Bell, I understand the temptation to try and create
otherwise absent facts to support your argument, but please learn the
subject before you start running at the mouth.
