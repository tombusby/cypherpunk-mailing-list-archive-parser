There's not nearly enough information provided to know for sure.  
However, I'd think that any company which went to the trouble to build 
such a chip (custom, 0.5 micron process, etc) would go to the little extra 
effort to verify the algorithm is secure.

Generally, hardware is held to a higher standard because the difficulty of 
repair is higher:  Usually, you have to replace a chip.
