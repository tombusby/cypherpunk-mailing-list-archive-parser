You may be confused.  I hope it was clear that I didn't write that.
That text was part of the message from Ron Rivest that I included in my
message.

Well, I don't know what went on before 1968, but these days phone companies
don't keep wiretap orders secret because they are being nice to the police,
they keep them secret because the court order for the weretap also orders
them to.  Perhaps you aren't aware of this, but when a third party  is
ordered to turn over records or access to something, the order often
includes a provision that prohibits them from revealing the order to the
subject.  This is not unique to phone records; orders for bank records
frequently have secrecy provisions as well.
