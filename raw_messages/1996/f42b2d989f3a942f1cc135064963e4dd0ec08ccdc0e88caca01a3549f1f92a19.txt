Yes, I suppose we could revive the urban legend about the programmer at 
SW Bank in Houston who did this slight of hand for 18 mos and then split 
the country.

But there is a simpler method to avoid the problem entirely. There is 
suffcient horsepower in uP's these days to support "long hand" division 
and multiplication. Granted it takes some extra grey matter to write the 
routines, but once done, you can vary the amount of precision to whatever 
you desire and not have to worry about accuracy.

The only penalty you pay for is time. If you need the accuracy, you'll 
gladly give the time, or put more horsepower in the box.
