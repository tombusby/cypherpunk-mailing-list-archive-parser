	Perhaps I don't understand what you are saying. I just want to ensure that
you understand that the PICS labels can be distributed in multiple ways.
(document, server, label bureau.) I suspect you do, and what you are
objecting to is that documnet-embedded labels will have a greater weight
than those distributed by third parties:

And consequently authors have a greater responsibility/liability than you
would like:

In which case, I disagree. I think accurate, consistent, "objective" (I
know this is an argument on the other thread, I think one can get
relatively "objective ratings" see my RSAC case study for a break down on
the qualities of rating systems on my ecommerce page (home page below))
well branded and reputable agents will have a greater weight, and will have
a market motivation for accuracy exceeding regulatory pressure. (Plus,
there is nothing preventing thresh-hold tolerances for use with multiple
ratings.)
