A. Olsen is too optimistic by far in his characterization of the likely
psychological state of the person who sent the above message. 
 
I just published my CyberAngel piece in _Computer underground Digest_ and,
during my researches, I heard a lot of material as least as hostile as the
mail Olsen posted. 
 
The hysteria over the Four Horseman, particularly the "kiddie
pornographers" is *intense.*  So is the ignorance. 
 
To repeat in a different form: 
 
the word is "hysteria" as in "Salem Witch Trials." 
 
the ignorance is intense, e.g. ".gif" is a "kiddie porn" code word for
"girlie interchage files" etc.etc.
