The work I posted discusses many and weighs their strengths and weaknesses.

Generally, and not that I would support the obstruction of justice, the 
key to resisting any coercion is not to leave anything valuable in the 
reach of the coercer.

As an example, if you live in the U.S., and your freedom is valuable to you, 
you're vulnerable.

If you own a house in the U.S., if you hold accounts in your real name in 
the U.S., if you work for an employer who is in the jurisdiction of the 
U.S., or if you have assets or an employer in any jurisdiction which has 
judicial recognition or information shring treaties with the U.S., you're 
vulnerable.

Shooting judges, if the above aren't satisified and if you're in a 
jurisdiction which extradites for murder, is only going to get you in deeper.

I might add that U.S. courts won't refuse to subject you to process 
because you were brought into the U.S. against your will, or in violation 
of international or local law.  Even non-cooperative jurisdictions won't 
always save you.  (Don't fly over or sail into international 
airspace/waters either).

There was a great article in Fortune about a historic tax fugitive that 
can show you how the U.S. can "getcha."  If your interested, I'll dig up 
a pointer.

Generally speaking, if you really need significant asset and judgment 
protection, seek the advice of a professional.  Professionals may be 
expensive, but if they will be cheaper than asset forfeiture consider 
consulting them.

I cannot recommend that you venture out on asset concealing or protection 
schemes without professional advice, no more that I could suggest you do 
your complicated tax work without professional advice.

I'll remind everyone that tax evasion and money laundering are illegal in 
the United States.
