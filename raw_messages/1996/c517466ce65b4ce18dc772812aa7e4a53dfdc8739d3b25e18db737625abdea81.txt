Do your own homework or pay me.

Look at your quote again.  You indicated there was no case law, or that it
never appeared here.  I suppose this is where someone with a real job is
supposed to take hours out of his or her time to type up a 10 page summary
of why you are a complete fool.  Sorry, I'm not biting.

I am insulting a lazy poster.  Do your own work for a change.  You
deserved every bit of condescending and (self) pretentious ire I had to
spill.

This from you?  Please.

Reason seems to have long since ceased to be useful in your case, "Vlad."

I accept that honor with pride.  As for claims or ideas, I stand
corrected.  I now believe you present neither.

It is generally the expectation that he who is presenting a supposed new
and novel idea support it him or herself.  You have failed to do so mostly
because you are content to rely on everyone else to flush out your
"arguments" for you.  I'm sorry if you feel supporting your own claims or
justifing the intellectual expenditures others might make in pursuing an
idea you present is a new facet of your "job description."  The fact is
that your ideas would have never escaped your fingertips if you had spent
a mere ten or twenty minutes bothering to get some background on the
amazingly useless idea you proposed.  That's insulting to everyone here.

How my refusal to spend an hour or more typing in the text of the 30
opinions it would take to finally get you to shut up (probably because
some new lunacy attracted your attention instead) is anything but
reasonable given the total lack of effort on your part to even have a
clue about the topic on which you propose to lead, is beyond me.  In case
you missed it the first time, my post is utterly devoid of informational
value by design.

Because given the topic you have brought up, my using your idea as a
"leaping off point" to demonstrate any legal knowledge would be akin to
factoring the number 6 to demonstrate my mastery of math.

No, I think I am destroying your reputation brownie points (if any
existed) as well as those attached to this idiotic thread.

Another poster discussed (quite well) the legal reasons your ideas were
moronic.  I think perhaps he had more time on his hands.
