Anyone looking for small 486 compatible pc's should check out the system
that scuba divers have been using for the last couple of years. They strap
on your tank, have a cable with one-hand keyboard (usually hangs on the R.
since your console is on the L.) that emulates a standard 101 and uses a
small display that hangs off your mask. They run standard windows apps and
are not too expensive. Check your local dive shop for specifics.
