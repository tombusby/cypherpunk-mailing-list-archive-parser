Marijuana isn't the only drug that doctors are reluctant to prescribe for fear
of losing their medical licenses.  There is a list of legal drugs that most
doctors would never prescribe.  The DEA wasn't able to put a ban on those
drugs, so they just send a bunch of armed thugs to harass any doctor who
prescribes them.  As for the difference between Prozac and THC, I really don't
know.  Marijuana is a Schedule I drug, meaning that it is dangerous and has
no medical value.  Methamphetamine is a Schedule II drug, meaning that it has
medical value and can be prescribed.  It doesn't make any sense to me either.

As for the public-relations campaign, the government is just going to drag a
bunch of old, flawed medical experiments that supposedly prove that marijauna
is dangerous.  Most of these experiments were conducted by Gabriel Nahas.
Meanwhile, the experiment done at the University of Virginia that shows that
marijuana has tumor-preventing properties will never be mentioned.  The FDA
immediately pulled the funding for this study when they discovered the results
and has banned all further medical experiments involving marijuana.  Nor will
any mention be made of The LaGuardia Report.

Crypto relevance is very minimal, other than the fact that pseudonymous
signatures would solve the problem of doctors being persecuted.  This does
show how the government might go about banning crypto.  Launch a "public
relations campaign" and start seizing FTP servers that make crypto available a
la Sundevil.  Finding loopholes to harass people without having togo through
due process is a very good tactic for undermining democracy.
