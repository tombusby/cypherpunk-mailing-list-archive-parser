It doesn't.  If q is a Mercenne prime, then p is prime if q = 2^p-1.  It
doesn't work the other way around.  If it did, then it would be very easy to
find out if a number is a Mercenne prime: just add 1 and find the base 2
logarithm and if the result is prime, then the original number is prime.  It's
much more difficult than that.  It would also be possible to find an infinite
number of Mercenne primes using a deterministic algorithm.
