If I recall correctly, don't currency traders make REAL money by doing 
just that. By moving money into different currencys and taking advantage 
of minor fluctuations and differences in exchange rates at different 
exchanges, these traders sometimes make a LOT of REAL money. I am not 
sure, but I think that it is called arbitrage trading or something like that.
