Sure they can.  Get a file system that honors security and limit that 
applet's access to certain directories only where the data it needs 
lives.  Do not give it access to everything.  A sandbox will allow this.

Same difference whether you use the signature or some other thing to 
grant or revoke access to certain resources.  Though if you use a 
signature as in the author who wrote it as opposed to something like a 
CRC which is unique for every control - then you are opening a wider hole 
than you want.  With apps like that you want to set security perms for 
each application, not all applications that were written by Macrosoft. :)

Fine - how many game users who how to unzip the java classes into their 
classpath?  Question is of knowledge not of what action they will take.
