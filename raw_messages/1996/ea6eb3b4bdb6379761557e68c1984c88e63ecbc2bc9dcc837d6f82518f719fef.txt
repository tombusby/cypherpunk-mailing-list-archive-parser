(1) Join Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) Live Online Tuesday Sept 17, 8:00 pm EDT

Representative Anna Eshoo (D-CA) will be live online on Tuesday September
17 at 8:00 pm EDT (5:00 pm PDT) to discuss her efforts bring privacy and
security to the Internet through the reform of US encryption policy.
Eshoo will also take questions from Netizens during the discussion.

Representative Eshoo, who represents the heart of California's Silicon
Valley, is a co-sponsor of HR 3011, the "Security and Freedom through
Encryption (SAFE) Act of 1996", a founding member of the Congressional

Momentum in Congress for real reform of US encryption policy remains
strong. The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on HR
