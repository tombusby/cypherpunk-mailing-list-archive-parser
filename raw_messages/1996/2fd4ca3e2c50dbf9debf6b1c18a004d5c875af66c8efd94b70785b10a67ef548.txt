TRS-80: A venerable microcomputer, twenty years ago (Tandy Radio Shack, I believe with 80 columns); many experiences begin with this one (and Altair (some years before) or Apple II).

DES: Data Encryption Standard, a (also venerable) cryptography algorithm, it has a too short key (56 bits effective) but a good design. Recycled, with TripleDES (or 3DES), in a three pass function.

GAK: Government Access to Key, his private key must be deposited (mandatory or pushed voluntary) to a public or private (registered) agency. The Law Enforcement Agencies (and intelligence agencies, but sh!) have access to the key with a court order (nobody is smiling).
