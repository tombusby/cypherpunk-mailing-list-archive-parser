I've read references to polls which repeatedly show that well over 60% of 
the public is opposed to wiretaps, period.

But no, I'm under no illusion that even a legal challenge would be respected.

Well, I agree it should be challenged, but if anything my point is that the 
reason it wasn't challenged was the fact that wiretap targets are never 
given the opportunity.  

(Note for the clueless out there: An after-the-fact challenge doesn't count. 
 Apparently, "non-incriminating" wiretaps are essentially never announced to 
the victim...er...target.  And judges are sufficiently biased, gutless, and 
brainless that they almost never throw out the _incriminating_ results of a 
wiretap warrant.  THis is for the same reason Judge Ito didn't throw out the 
evidence the four crooked detectives got in OJ's house, after jumping the 
fence without a warrant, claiming that they were afraid somebody was in 
danger inside.  As I'm fond of saying, "Fuhrman pretended to tell the truth, 
and Ito pretended to believe him.")

No, not at all.  The point is that acknowledged illegal tactics (remember, 
wiretaps were illegal before 1968, but they were done!) may be 
unquestionably "useful," but that doesn't mean that they are acceptable.  If 
anything, the fact that cops would use illegal tactics proves that they 
aren't very good judges of what tactics are appropriate.  Furthermore, the 
fact that telephone companies ALLOWED cops to do illegal wiretaps before 
1968 (and even assisted them) proves that you can't depend on them to limit 
these tactics to reasonable limits.

Since up until now people have not had a choice, I think it's appropriate to 
assume that every telephone customer would have been entitled to insist on 
an anti-wiretap clause, and got it.

That's misleading.  If a cop wants in your house to collect evidence but he 
doesn't have a warrant, not letting him in is "withholding evidence."   But 
that's obviously okay.  So you need to qualify that claim.

That depends on whose burden of proof you think it is.  Since:

1.  Wiretaps were done illegally before 1968, demonstrating that the people 
involved (cops, government officials) don't think they have to obey the law 
anyway.  This should destroy any presumption on your part that wiretaps are 
constitutional, because those people are the main ones pushing wiretaps.

2.  60% of the public opposes wiretaps, period.  (I think it's arguable that 
if most of the public decides that society should do without wiretaps, they 
are entitled to do this.  Otherwise, "Who's country is it?")

3.  Wiretaps do not resemble ordinary searches, because the target is not 
informed, and he's not given a chance to challenge them.

4.  Wiretaps have "never" been adequately challenged, precisely because the 
only outside people who know about them have no motivation to do them.  
(Primarily telephone companies.)


I'd say the bulk of the evidence is that the legal system accepts wiretaps 
simply as a convenience, without genuinely believing that they are 
constitutional.

No, YOU'RE mixing it up.  _DOMESTIC_ wiretaps are being compared with 
DOMESTIC use of encryption.  ITAR says nothing about wiretaps.  

The government is pushing Clipper et al based primarily on domestic wiretap issues.

Not really.  It's just that when there's enough evidence of dishonesty 
already in the treatment of this issue in the courts, there is no reason to 
presume that the right decision will be reached in the future.
