Well, that would be a serious problem. The big question is: who decides
the routing? With the existing nym setup, the client decides the entire
route. The nymserver knows only the first hop. For the nymserver to be
able to route around damage, it would have to know that there is damage,
and that implies knowing the route.

One fix for the problem is just to refresh your nym regularly. If you
are lucky enough to be using premail, then just run "premail -makenym
nym@alpha". I'm considering adding code that automatically figures out
which nyms need to be refreshed when a remailer drops in the reliability
ratings and automatically does it, but that probably won't make it into
the next release of premail.

The fact that you can refresh nyms makes the problem you bring up much
less severe.
