Nope. That's some people's preferred shot, but may not be the best one or
even a realistic one. It's certainly a partisan political advocacy (in the
sense that people are partisan about this issue, not in the sense of a
particular political party). Yet that attitude didn't get any legislation
to stop Clipper I.

My point was very simple--if the government is going to say a system is
voluntary, make them put it in writing in the rules or legislation. We
failed to do that with Clipper I (when they said in non-rulesmaking
statements that they had no intention of making escrow mandatory--but
nobody said "OK. Put it in writing as a formal policy."). As a result, many
in government even at the higher policy-making levels are still calling for
mandatory escrow. Had it been in the rules, it's less likely they could
have overtly gone against a rules-making covenant/compromise.

It's simple pragmatic regulatory politics. It's how the system works, and
using the system itself to achieve one's goals is one of the more powerful
techniques around. You don't have to like it, but you do have to decide
whether you'd rather be "right" or get the result.
