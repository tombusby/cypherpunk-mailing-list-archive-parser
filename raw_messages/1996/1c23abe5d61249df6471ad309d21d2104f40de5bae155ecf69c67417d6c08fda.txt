Argh.

I got this email as well.  I thought at first that it had been sent 
to the cypherpunks mailing list, but it was actually sent directly to 
me (at least that's what the headers indicate).  So now I have to go 
through the *hell* of trying to get my name off Sanford Wallace's 
mailing list.

I wonder how long it will take?
