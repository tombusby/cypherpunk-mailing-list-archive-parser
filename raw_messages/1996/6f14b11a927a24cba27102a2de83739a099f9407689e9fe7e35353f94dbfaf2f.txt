I said "modern" country.  Even so, Russia and the rest are much more market
dominated than they used to be.  Transition will not be easy but I doubt if
they'll go back.  As for an eternity of slavery being superior to too
rambunctious freedom -- we won't let them be that stupid.  The "cancer of
Anglo-Saxon values" is pretty powerful.

That would require outlawry of crypto over the backbone and some way of
convincing the backbone to run government approved code.  Quite a bit of
