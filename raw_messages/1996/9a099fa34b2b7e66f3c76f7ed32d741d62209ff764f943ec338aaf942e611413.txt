Another interesting connection is that John Aristotle Phillips
is the former Princeton student who designed an atom bomb
as his junior physics project.  (He wasn't a brilliant physicist -
he was trying to save his grade point average by doing a good paper :-)
Senator Feinstein, of course, is a leader in the "Bomb Info Off Lists"
movement....
