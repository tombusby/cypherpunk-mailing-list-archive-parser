The Prez was in Minneapolis today, so all the TV stations have to act as
though it were a big deal.  In the wrapup coverage of the non-event, a
WCCO talkinghead trotted out another non-story of a security breach at
MSP, where someone is thought to have slipped by security.  The
talkinghead gave complete and clear instructions on how to accomplish
this in the process of "reporting" the incident.

If I find it "reported" on their website, can I blame the net?
