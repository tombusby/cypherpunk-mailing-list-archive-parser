In order to remain compliant with the new California law requiring
increased use of "Ebonics," the new academic name for "Black English" (and
known by honkey mofos as "ghetto jive"). Apparently the coloreds have had
enough of "standard English" and its repression of their culture. To meet
the requirements of this new law, 10% of my posts from now on will be
written as best I can manage in the Ebonic language.

Switching to Ebonics:

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
