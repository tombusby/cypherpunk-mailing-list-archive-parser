You missed my point.

1) hook into the winsock and look for an FV message in the web data stream,
save the ID.

2) now look for an approve/deny/fraud, when you see one you know that the
user uses an IP connection for mail and web.

3) only now does the attack begin.

The attack does not trigger until it *knows* that both FV orders and
confirms are moving via winsock - I.E. it does not report back the FV ID of
the victim until it sees the victim use FV and *knows* it can intercept the
reply.  The key  here is not breaking all cases just a significant number
and not setting off too many alarms.

This significantly lowers the fraud detection risk, now the fraud does not
get noticed until the card statement shows up, the same as with a card
number snooping attack.

Yes it will miss a large group of FV customers who use AOL, CI$ etc
(although a similar hook in the common serial port code on Win95 could catch
most of them).

The basic point is if the achine is not secure then no data on it is either.
