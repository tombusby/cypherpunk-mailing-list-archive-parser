Cypherpunks understand that protection of one's personal data is best done
by protecting it oneself, not by advocating or relying on laws to limit the
use of data acquired by others.

I mention this because I've noticed many forwardings of messages relating
to the abstract notion of "privacy," with the subtext--at least as I
perceive things--that there "ought to be a law." I'm not saying either Alan
Arndt or Gregg Weissman feel there ought to be laws banning what the bank
did, but this is certainly something I have heard misguided suscribers (and
subscribers) of this list advocating. In the name of privacy, let's pass
some more laws!

It's hardly surprising in an era of massive data bases and ready
availability of much public information--including political affiliations,
if so volunteered by voter-units--that some banks are expanding their data
bases in the manner described. Get used to it, or don't reveal as much.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
