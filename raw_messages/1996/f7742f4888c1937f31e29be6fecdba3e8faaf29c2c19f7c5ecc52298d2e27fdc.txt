Every single foreign computer company left during roughly the same 
period, as did almost all foreign companies and anybody who had a choice.

The reasons generally given by those who left, for this mass exodus, 
which eventually sent the government into insolvency, is that Indian 
]officials were arrogant, rude, dishonest, corrupt, continually broke 
contracts and agreements, and attempted to exercise direct power over 
everyone and everything.

If indian government officials have a different version, I would not
regard that version as coming "from the horses mouth"
