And practically everybody else, I'm sure!  It was  written up in Science
News magazine, BTW.

Well, by definition if it works in hex, it'll work in octal, "quadal" (?),
binary, etc.  That's ASSUMED, since they would be subsets (co-sets?) of each
other.

Yeah, well, I understand your frustration, but to me the really amazing part
is that the elephant flies at all, and not how well he flies (<G>)  (In
other words, the amazing thing is that there is a predictable relationship
in ANY base system)  Chances are the thing WON'T work in base
3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15, and any other non 2**n base.  Or, at least, it
will take a DIFFERENT equation to work in those other bases, if they work at
all.

Not "regular," you used the wrong term.  As a mathematician's term of art,
this is called "normal." In other words, equal numbers of digits 0-9, equal
numbers of digit pairs 00-through 99, equal number of digit triplets
000-999, etc.  A series of random numbers, by definition, must be "normal."
But "Normal" numbers do not necessarily have to be random.  As you might
expect, however, testing for "normality" is a good first test of "randomness." 

(I'm not a mathematician, and I don't play one on TV.  Don't be overly
impressed with the preceeding knowledge; I'm sure there are dozens if a
hundred people reading cypherpunks who know more math than I do. I only got
a 780 on the math portion of my SAT, 20 years ago...  790's and 800's
weren't all that uncommon.)

Yes, pi is apparently "normal."  (at least four the first 4 billion or so
digits...)

Of course, I'm not sure of the ramifications of this new discovery
(individual-digit computability of pi) on the facts you list...  (for
example, inter-digit dependence)   However, if the digital representations
of the digits of pi were indeed still individually "random" and they could
be individually computed rapidly enough, at least hypothetically you could
use the digits of pi as a "one-time-pad".  Obviously, everyone would know
(at least, conceptually) the ENTIRE CONTENT of the pad; the only issue would
be the location where you started.  If the starting point was the key, and
could be defined by a number of at least, say, 256-bits long, it might be a
replacement for IDEA whose current length is fixed at 128 bits. 

I suppose the problem with this technique will probably be that it would
take too long to calculate the (a number somewhere around 2**256) bit of pi,
and for an n-bit message you'd have to do this n times.

I'm sure somebody else will have seen it.  It was in Science News in the
last couple of months, as I recall.  Some kind soul will probably type it
in.  Maybe I can even retrieve my copy from my sister.
