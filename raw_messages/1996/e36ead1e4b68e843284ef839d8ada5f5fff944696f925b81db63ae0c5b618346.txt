Not, at least, for me.  The "backyard nukes" analogy is the one typically grabbed by the anti-gunners when they're trying to justify limiting the 2nd amendment.  One problem that I see with this "reasoning" is that they never analogize by trying to limit the power of THE STATE to own weapons, despite the fact that maximum-bang weaponry increased by over a factor of 1,000,000 between about 1935 and 1955 or so.  And not to mention that military weaponry deadliness increased by probably a factor of at least 100 between 1790 and 1935.  
Since (I assume you understand the argument, here) the US Constitution is supposed to be the complete statement of the legal powers of the Federal government, what's missing is a justification for even ALLOWING the government to engage in the kinds of weapons developments that it did post 1935 on constitutional/legal grounds.  The significance of this argument is this:  If you argue that "things have changed" and indiiduals should not be able to make/own nukes, that opens the door to similar claims that "things have changed" and the US Government should not be allowed to maintain the current military that it does.

Don't just come back and say the Constitution provides for open-ended "defense":  Nobody today would argue that the writers of the Constitution could have anticipated the development of the H-bomb or the F-15 or AWACS, but I see nobody using that argument to de-empower the government, while I FREQUENTLY see people trying to justify  restrictions on guns based on the kinds of developments in guns that have happened since the muzzle-loader was king.

Sometimes, it is indeed.  Especially since "the state" SHOULD serve at the pleasure of the individuals, not hte other way around.  You may disagree...

It's also your "straw-man argument."

While it's true that "the world is screwed  up" and it's also true that "governments have made it screwed up," libertarians don't usually (?) try to claim that governments bear _full_ responsibility.  Just most of it.

Actually, the term "statist" is a particularly useful and interesting term.  Against the backdrop of people stuck in their traditional left/right, liberal/conservative, Democrat/Republican ruts, libertarians remindthe world that politics can be viewed even better in two dimensions, for example the "Nolan Chart," otherwise known as "the world's smallest political quiz."  The thing I've always found fascinating about that representation is that it contains, embedded within it, the left/right spectrum, but perpendical to this is the libertarian/authoritarian (statist) axis.  In other words, it showed that some people seem to be just naturally control-freaks, whether they come from the left or the right.

Now,  language is IMPORTANT.  If you can control the language, you can control the debate.  Historically, there was no easy way to describe people now well-described by the term "statist", because they could be either of the "liberal" or "conservative" bent, the "Republican" or "Democratic" bent, etc.

[note:  already in the Cypherpunks area he has been given a number of reasons for this; primarily based on attack by non-libertarian states]  These examples are presumably true;  governments fear competition that may later eliminate them.  Companies do too, but they're generally limited in their ability to fight back.

A misleading statement.  They may never "like" any system forced on them, and by saying they "find" it implies that it is made by (and, presumably, ENFORCED BY) somebody else!

What's wrong with sabotaging the work of flaming statists?!?

Maybe you meant, "prevent."  But even expressed this way, that was wrong.

So what else is new for nearly all political philosophy?  If anything, I've heard more "us vs. them" from NON-libertarians than from libertarians.

Maybe this portion of the philosophy ISN'T the difference, and something else IS...

>none.  we have a system in which the designers said it was "of, by, and
>for the people", but a libertarian cannot handle this unity, 

The variability is the entent to which "this system" controls society.  Even if we assume that "a government" is necessary, there is still an enormous variability as to HOW MUCH that government controls. 200 years of change has produced an enormous differnece.  There is NO REASON TO BELIEVE that libertarians should have to "handle" the 1996 version of reality that was only originally intended in 1790 to control a tiny fraction of one's life.  Your argument seems to be a paean to an open-ended approval of government.

>nor can
>apparently any other citizen in the US that criticizes their government

The answer to that is simple.  "Their ('our') government" is INDEED "something apart from themselves"!  For just one example, those military contractors pay their bribes to POLITICIANS, not randomly selected citizens, for a GOOD REASON. Governments of all kinds are INDEED, "apart" from their citizenry!!!

Detweiler is beginning to lose touch with reality with this previous sentence.

Odd that you would claim this.  If anything, the libertarians I've met are about as "anti-egalitarian" as they come, as long as you're talking about GOVERNMENT ENFORCED ACCESS TO WEALTH AND POWER.  


>but in their arguments, such as Hammill's, you will always find subtle

Subtle?  SUBTLE????  I have, in fact, heard more RABIDLY ANTI-EGALITARIAN (again:  Where egalitarianism is defined as government-enforced equal-treatment by private individuals of private individuals.) arguments by libertarians, who object (for just one example) to the ADA (Americans with a Disability Act) because it requires private organizations (corporations, for instance) to build buildings to be "accessible" to everyone.  If anything, libertarians are the most PROUDLY anti-egalitarian people around, in that they don't want the heavy hand of government to try to equalize society by the barrel of the gun.

In other words, Detweiler...er...Nuri  has totally dissociated himself from reality.  He clearly doesn't understand the first thing about libertarianism.

Actually, since "governments" are merely the agents and employees of the citizenry (or they should be!!!) this is a valid argument.  Since the government is the "employee" and the citizenry pays it, the citizenry gets to call the shots.

Actually, my "Assassination Politics" idea stands an excellent chance of achieving exactly these breakthroughs.  You don't like it, however.

In other words, you've given up now.  Thank you for your flames.  They'll probably convince something new that I'm right...
