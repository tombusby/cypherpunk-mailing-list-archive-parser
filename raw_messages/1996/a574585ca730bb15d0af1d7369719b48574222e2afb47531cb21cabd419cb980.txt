No I have to dissagree. Who I send mail to or whom I receive mail from is no-ones business. I for one have no intention of "signing up" or "regestering" with any mail server. I most certainally want to be the one to decide what mail I receive or do not receive, not someone elses idea of what I should receive.

Sorry but I will not be made a sheep for the "protection" from spam. baah baah
