Washington Post investigative reporter JIM McGEE. He has co-written 
with Brian Duffy the new book "Main Justice: The Men And Women 
Who Enforce The Nation's Criminal Laws And Guard Its Liberties." 
It's published by Simon and Schuster. The book is about the changing 
role of the U.S. Justice Department. As the fears of terrorism increase, 
Congress and the White House are giving the Justice Department 
more investigative powers and a wider jurisdiction which includes
actions in foriegn countries. McGee warns in the book that along with 
the apparent protection this could provide Americans it could also 
erode individual liberties. McGee shared a 1987 Pulitzer Prize for a 
series of stories on the Iran Contra Affair. McGee lives in Virginia.
