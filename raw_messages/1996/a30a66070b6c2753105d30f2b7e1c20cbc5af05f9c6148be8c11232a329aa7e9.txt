That still doesn't make since.

First, there were laws.  And we had to obey them.

Then, they added ITAR.  And they want us to obey it.

Finally, it seems, they're giving us "guidelines."  Not law, Not ITAR.

Next it's gonna be their their fondest desires, their preferences,and 
finally their whims.

What's wrong with this picture?    Do I detect an ass-kissing contest?

You should have told them that if they're "evaluating their guidelines" that 
means that NO future modifications to those guidelines is binding on you, 
since it is not part of ITAR and is CERTAINLY not part of the law.  You 
should have memorialized the contact with a lawyer's letter, and promptly 
posted the new version of your software with whatever version of the 
precautions  (MIT, RSA, or?) you felt most happy with.
