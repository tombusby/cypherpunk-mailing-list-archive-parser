The things that I learned was that instructions should be sent to the
participants well in advance.  

Key fingerprints should be brought on paper becuase it is not always assured
of having a computer there to read the disk. (We had a lap top that was
refusing to read disks effectivly.  We had to use on of the Habit's
computers.)  
Distributing the keys on disk worked well.  (I also brought PGP and various
tools for those who did not have them.) With the key server there is still
an issue of verifying that the key is valid.  Best to have the key
fingerprint on paper, where it can be read to the group.

We also found that reading the first half of the fingerprint was more than
attiquite and saved a great deal of time.  (Which was later wasted on
getting keys off of disks.)

I will also be distributing batch files for those dos users who are not
familiar with how to sign keys and creating extra keyrings.

Most of the problems were procedural rather than technical.

It went well for a first run...
