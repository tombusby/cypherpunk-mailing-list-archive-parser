Exactly the point, bingo!  The point is this, exactly what do YOU define as
*fucking shit* so that anyone who visits your page will know exactly what
they can and can't say to Lance Cottrell. We've determined that you don't
want to receive the HipCrime URL from your mailto: button. What about the
next visitor who comes across your page, how will they know exactly what you
do or do not find interesting? Will you put a lengthy *what I expect from
all correspondents who use my mailto: button* explanation on the page?

Perhaps a simple, *don't mail me unless I already know you and want to hear
what you have to say...* tag?
