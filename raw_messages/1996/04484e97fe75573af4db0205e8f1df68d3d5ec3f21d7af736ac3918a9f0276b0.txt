Subject: Protocol Action: MIME Security with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) to
	 Proposed Standard
Date: Wed, 19 Jun 96 11:06:28 -0400
Message-ID:  <9606191106.aa22287@IETF.CNRI.Reston.VA.US>



  The IESG has approved the Internet-Draft "MIME Security with Pretty
  Good Privacy (PGP)" <draft-elkins-pem-pgp-04.txt> as a Proposed
  Standard. This has been reviewed in the IETF but is not the product
  of an IETF Working Group.

  The IESG contact persons are Harald Alvestrand, Keith Moore, and Jeff
  Schiller.

Technical Summary

  This document describes how Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) can be used to
  provide privacy and authentication using the Multipurpose Internet
  Mail Extensions (MIME) security content types described in RFC1847.

Working Group Summary

  This document was not the product of an IETF working group but was
  reviewed via a 4 week IETF wide last call. The last call failed to
  raise any significant issues.

Protocol Quality

  This document was reviewed for the IESG by Jeffrey I. Schiller. The
  protocol provides for an elegant way of encapsulating PGP objects
  within a MIME framework by making use of Security Multiparts for MIME
  (RFC1847). This  permits a MIME aware user agent to read  and process
  PGP  signed and/or encrypted messages, yet it provides sufficient
  backwards compatibility for users with non-MIME aware mail user
  agents to make use of PGP directly to manually process messages
  prepared with this protocol.
