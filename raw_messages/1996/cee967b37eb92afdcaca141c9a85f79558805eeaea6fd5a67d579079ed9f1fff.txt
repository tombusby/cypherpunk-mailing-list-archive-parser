Probably not necessary. Simulators do just fine. And the FPGAs themselves
top out at 50 to 80 MHz.

Easy to access. They are everywhere. The EPROMs are about $6 each and are
serial. You could build a programmer at home.

While there are OTP FPGAs out there (typocally Altera), many are in-circuit
programmable *any* number of times since they use SRAM internally  not
EPROM cells to program the configuration. The latest twist on FPGAs is to
add more RAM internally and have them reprogram themselves on the fly,
hundreds of thousands of times a second. This cuts the logic requirements
down for desidhns that don't need all of the logic all of the time.

True, but $400 is probably not far low.

My employer uses FPGAs in all new designs for production. They are *very*
common for products that sell into the thousands per year. Mask-programmed
gate arrays have the major disadvantage of very long lead times, usually a
more pressing requirement than saving $30 per board over several thousand
boards.

Companies now make boards that contain just FPGAs wired in a grid. They are
sold as general-purpose logic engines with software to implement circuits
as hardware simulations. I'm sure that these would do just fine, though
they are costly.
