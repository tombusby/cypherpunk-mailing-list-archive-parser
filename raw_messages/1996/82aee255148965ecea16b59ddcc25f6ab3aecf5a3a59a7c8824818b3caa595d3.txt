I can't imagine _any_ set of circumstances which would cause Zimmermann,
Atkins (?), Plumb (?), and anyone else who might still be on the PGP
development team to include GAK.

After all, those heartwarming stories about Burmese rebels using PGP to
communicate using laptops in the jungles would then be replaced by:

"16 April 1998, A.P., Rangoon, Burma. Internal Security Minister Bopalong
Myanmoon announced today that rebel communications were intercepted and
decrypted two weeks ago with the cooperation of the International Key
Authority. As a result of this raid, 63 rebels were captured, tried, and
executed. Visiting Rangoon at the time, U.S. Attorney General Louis Freeh
was said to be satisfied that international key escrow was having such
positive effects."
