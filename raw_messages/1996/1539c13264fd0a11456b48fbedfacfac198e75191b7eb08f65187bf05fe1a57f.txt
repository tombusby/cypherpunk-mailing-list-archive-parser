Patents are different from copywrites.  In Canada there are specific
guidelines pertaining to what can and cannot be patented.  These guide
lines are avalible from the government (look in the blue pages).
Algorithims, circut designs, etc, etc (what about papers about them?)
are specifically excluded from copywrite laws in all countries that 
adhere to the international copywrite treaty (or what ever).

Algorithms come under intelectual property protection but I have no
idea what laws govern that.  I do recall that sevral years ago, a 
company sued an emplyee that was leaving.  The court ordered that he
could not obtain employment in his previous field for seven years
(practically a life time).

If in doubt you should probably seek professional legal advice because
you could get yourself into MAJOR legal trouble.
