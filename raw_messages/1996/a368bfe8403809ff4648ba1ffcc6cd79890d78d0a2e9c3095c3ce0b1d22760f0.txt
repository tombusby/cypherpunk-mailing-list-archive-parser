Though some will petulantly claim that this has "nothing to do with
crypto," I think the report on legislation which may lead to new levels of
national identification is very apropos to the themes of this list. A
national ID card could be tied in to the CDA and other such legislation:
the "Internet Driver's License" we are worried about. This would also
facilitate the criminalization of anonymous remailers.

(I noticed at a local night spot large posters announcing the city's "Zero
Tolerance" policy for passing a drink to a minor. Imagine the same folks
passing laws about the criminalization of giving access to a minor....)

> social security card or a passport linked to biometric identifier
> birth certificates and drivers' licenses:
> 
>         The House bill, H.R. 2202, if passed will bring in the biometric

> biometric identifier is clearly in the picture here.  Here's why:
> 
>         1) The report of the U.S. Commission on Immigration entitled U.S.
> Immigration Policy: Restoring Credibility talks openly about the use
> of biometric identifiers for driver's licenses on page 65.  Key
> language throughout the report dealing with fraudulent use of

> the biometric identifier form of identification.
> 
>         2) The NarcOfficer, official publication of international narcotics
> enforcement officer association in its September/October 1995 issues
> states point blank that a universal biometric identifier system is
> intended for use by everyone on the planet.
> 
>         3) The Senate bill formerly S. (unumbered) now split into S. 269 and
> S. 1361 in sections 111-116 talks about birth certificates with
> 'fingerprint or other biometric data'.  The same section talks about
> new driver's licenses with 'fingerprint or other item of biometric
> data'.
> 
>         4) The Hoke Amendment to H.R. 2202 added by the House Judiciary
> Committee talks about a 'demonstration pilot project with a reliable,
> easy to use, confirmation mechanism'.
> 
> 
>         5) The McCullum amendment, no.4 on the calendar of amendments to H.R.
> 2202 talks about creating an official document that 'offers the best
> possible security against counterfeiting, forgery, alteration, and
> misuse'.  And provides for creating a new social security card that
> would be 'as secure against fraudulent use as United States passport'.
> Part of the catch here is which version of the passport?  The Senate

>         The McCullum amendment would make the new technology binding on all
