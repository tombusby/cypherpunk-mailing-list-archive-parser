As a lurker on the list, I'd like to second this opinion. The cypherpunks
list is held up to be this almighty oracle of cryptographic information.
Yet, every time I subscribe to it (this is the fourth time in a year) I have
to wade through irrelevant personal attacks and various other rubbish. I
mean, really. This is worse than Fidonet.

However, I suppose that with any gathering of (mostly) intelligent, liberty
and privacy minded people, there are likely to be clashes of one sort or
another. If the anonymous twits will grow up and stop stirring things up,
maybe the rest of us can learn something.

Just my $0.02
