As I have said before, European & other foreign users, who get the strong-
crypto version should pay Netscape what they owe Netscape, to keep the ITAR
as the issue, and not piracy. These are two separate issues, and if necessary
the foreign users can mail anonymous cash [the paper kind] to assuage their
consciences. Not all will do this, of course, but that's another example of
ITAR losing US companies $ again. Lucky is, as usual right. There is a double
standard for PGPdistribution vs other strong crypto distribution, and Tim is
also right that this GAK-loving info-disclosure requirement sets a *really*
lousy precedent for later software distributions. Pelease deal with issues
separately.
