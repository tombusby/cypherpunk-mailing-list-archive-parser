I seem to have upset you, Matt Miszewski, and I am sorry for that.  It
appears to me that the problem we have is that we have different ideas
about what is right and different perceptions of the nature of the
world.

It may appear that I intentionally put words in your mouth.  This is
not the case.  We have different ideas about what is obvious.  I have
made assumptions, but they seemed clear to me.  Apparently, they were
not.  We may still have a fruitful discussion.

I am assuming that you agree that somebody who has earned their money
honestly should be able to lend it to whomever they please for
whatever reason they like.  You call this private lending.  (Please
correct me if I am wrong.)

I believe that five friends should be able to get together, pool their
resources, and lend their money to whomever they like.

I believe that ten, or a hundred, or a thousand people should be able
to pool their money and lend it to whomever they please for whatever
reason they like.

That, essentially, is what a bank is.  I do not believe the government
should dictate which people you, or your bank, are allowed to lend to.

It does not seem reasonable to me to tell people who they may lend
money to on the grounds that some people might have obtained their
money dishonestly.  What would be reasonable would be to charge the
dishonest people with their crimes and return the property to the
rightful owners.

I do not believe that in practice discrimination is clear at all.

If I put up a sign in my store saying "Irish need not apply", then
there is a case.  Usually, it is not so clear.

It is difficult to prove discrimination because merit is so hard to
determine.  Many factors go into a hiring decision.  In the end, it is
usually made on the gut level.  There is really no way to prove that
the decision was discriminatory.

Consider the computer industry.  For whatever reasons, right now there
are very few African-American software engineers who are amongst the
very best.  They exist, but you don't see them very often.  What this
means is that you can't look at the percentage of African-Americans
working for a software company to decide whether the company makes
discriminatory hiring decisions.

We can certainly discuss policy without delving into Title VII and its
repeal.  One advantage of discussing the policy in general is that we
can make statements about entire classes of legislation, rather than
specific laws which should be added or repealed.

No, I told you my opinion.  So far nobody has demonstrated in a

believe that disenfranchisement is a small part of the explanation.

It is true that not all rich people use their wealth to their own best
advantage.  I am not claiming that all rich people are greedy and
smart.  What I am claiming is that many rich people are greedy and
will certainly seize opportunities that are presented to them.

Let's say one in a thousand rich people is willing to exploit the
inefficiencies of the home mortgage market.  This represents a vast
pool of capital which we are not seeing in "redlined" areas, if what
you say is true.  When people with capital so universally avoid an
investment, my first thought is not that every last one of them is a
racist.  My first thought is that it is not a good investment.

(My next thought is "Gee, if they're wrong, I could make a lot of
money!")

that makes me think I am.

You might find it more effective to explain in what way I am an idiot.
Remember, I and the thousands of other people who read this list may
not necessarily know what you know.  It may be that some of us only
lack a little explanation or a little helping hand to start us on the

How will I learn if you call me an idiot instead of explaining your
other views?  That may be effective in convincing people who already
agree with you, but it is not a way to win converts.  When you mention
escaping from the killing fields, I simply have no idea what you are
talking about.  (I do not say this to be insulting.)

I outlined a plan which would not require you to put up any money of
your own.  As an attorney, you have a tremendous advantage because you
don't have to pay legal fees.

Your own debt burden doesn't matter much if the holding company
borrows the money.  You can give your investors control of the company
and just take commissions on every mortgage you create.

That's nice.  I mean that.  But, if the inefficiency you are pointing
at is as large as you say, there should be an opportunity to make many
millions of dollars.  Surely, you could do some good with all that
money.  And, imagine what effect you would have if you did make
yourself rich lending to poor people who are subjected to irrational
discrimination.  Maybe some other rich people would get the good idea.

It causes harm if you believe people have an obligation to work with
everybody.  I don't believe this.  Let's say somebody likes only
Albanians and hates everybody else.  I would rather that person spent
his or her time with Albanians and not with me.  No harm done.  What
is more, I believe I have no moral right to demand that person spend
time with me if they don't want to do so, for whatever reason,
including discrimination.

The "funny" I had in mind was that it wasn't such a good investment,
not that lawyers are universally corrupt.  The fear that potential
investors have is not that the "poor people are planning something",
but that they are not planning anything and will be unable to pay back
the money they borrow.

But the mortgage market is huge.  And, we have inner cities all over
the U.S.  If you there are large areas which are completely unserviced
by lending institutions, this is a huge opportunity.

I am prepared to hear that there are barriers to entry.  What are
they?

If you knew where Red Rackham got his name, you would find it amusing.

No, good ROI does not mean good investment.  "Past performance does
not guarantee future results."  An investor cares about future
results.  What happens to mortgages in poor areas during the next
recession?

BTW, what reasons did your prospective investors give for declining?

This wouldn't surprise me much.  But, aren't student loans typically
cosigned, often by the government?  I hope the problem is obvious.

If people (e.g., banks) want to lend their money to high default rate
groups, I won't object unless it's my money.

Smart.

Usually, poor people know somebody with a car.  But, let's say they
don't.  There are all sorts of delivery and shipping services
available.  Taxi services, for instance, usually have a few vans
around for hauling things.  And, there are grocery delivery services.
You could probably find a store which would throw in delivery if
enough goods were moving.  Say it costs $20 (you take the bus there),
that's not much when spread over a thousand dollars of food.

Please explain in greater detail how the dynamic of power works in

I was not proposing that successful African-Americans "help out" their

see the opportunity and exploit it to the benefit of all parties.

Yes, it appears I did make an assumption.  Every redlining discussion
I have seen in the past concerned African-Americans and this caused me
to make a careless statement.  My apologies.

Getting back to the point, you have failed to explain how banks get
away with their discriminatory practices.  I think the markets see
redlining as damage and route around it.  Why do you believe this is
not happening?

(Astute observers will notice that this thread really does concern the
cypherpunk list.  Summary: Cryptoanarchy will loosen or even eliminate
controls on the flow of capital.  This benefits anybody who is
otherwise shut out of the system, including poor people.)

>
>What's so difficult.  God, I hope you arent an attorney.

Let's consider some laws we could make to stop redlining.  "You will
not draw red lines on maps around neighborhoods where you will not
make loans."  In practice, you will not find the maps and it will be
hard to prove the case.  The banks will make a few loans in the areas
they have redlined just to comply with the law.

The next law will be more complicated.  The government has to dictate
how many loans in what amounts are to be made where.  This is known in
other countries as "central planning".  It has a poor track record.

You may counter, "But you said it would be hard to define and then you
said it could be defined."  I believe that this sort of "law"
stretches the meaning of the phrase the "rule of law" because the
government is not constrained in any way.  It dictates the bank's
actions.

In practice, I think the way it works is that a bank has to make loans
to the same area where it received deposits.  It is unclear whether
this benefits poor people who are good credit risks, but it definitely
punishes poor people who want to deposit money because it makes it a
less attractive market in which to offer banking services.  The
consequence is that many poor people keep their cash around the house.
Naturally, this leads to increased theft and greater difficulty in
saving.

The law has the effect of saying "Poor people can only lend their
money to other poor people."  I find it hard to believe that his
benefits the poor or was intended to do so.

It's a pretty easy investigation.  I doubt it costs much.  You've

Maybe you can help me with some history.  Didn't the government have
something to do with enforcing slavery laws?  Perhaps I missed
something.

Usually, we want the government to tell other people what to do and to
leave ourselves alone.  Since I respect the desire other people have
to make decisions about their lives, I oppose most governmental
interference.

While you did not state it explicitly, in the context above I
interpreted this to mean that you supported laws which restricted the
use banks make of information they obtain from their clients.

In other words, people are not allowed to tell each other what they

What you discovered was that I strongly disagree with your point of
view.  That does not mean that I am not interested in what you have to
say.

But let's assume the worst: I am terrible person and I am only using
you to disseminate my own political ideas.  You may find that
patiently demonstrating the flaws in my thinking or how my beliefs are
unfounded in reality is more effective at persuading other people.  As
it is, it appears that you are evading the questions I raise.  The
views I hold are not uncommon in the United States.  I have to think
that you would do the world a service by exposing their flaws, if
there are any.
