I guess I tend to react to the Java hype with bemusement rather than
horror.  I enjoy joking with the clerks at Computer Literacy Bookstore
about the "Java book of the day".  However, unlike so much of the
industry's over hyped marketing, with Java there is actually something
worth while hidden under the massive hype.

Java appears to have a chance of being adopted widely in the industry.  We
can discuss until the cows come home why Smalltalk, Scheme etc. have not
achieved wide usage.  I suspect it may be a combination of unfamiliar
syntax, licensing issues, version compatibility issues, and the inability
to do low level programming.  These issues may also hit Java, but for now
it is the nicest language around with a bandwagon behind it.  If it
replaces Basic, that will be a significant step forward.

I agree that all the hype has been about applets.  However there is one
common non-applet Java application that shows that significant applications
can be written in Java.  That application is the Java compiler itself.  If
you are running on a Sun system, you can do real applications today.  (On
the Mac you are still in the "applet jail", but I haven't opened the latest
Java environment that arrived on my desk last month, so I may be obsolete.)

I thought this was the effect the Unix people get when they run
applications such as firewall code in a "chroot jail".  Perhaps Netscape
could make you happy by having its Unix based browsers run Java applet
interpreters in such a jail.  (I don't know, Unix is an imperfectly spoken
foreign language to me.)

Why don't we have one of these now?  (N.B. not a rhetorical question)
