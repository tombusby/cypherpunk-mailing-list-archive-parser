I must say I was pleased (and, I'm sorry to say, surprised) not to hear 
people talking about that "conspiracy" on this list. I gave a friend at 
the Merc hell for publishing a story saying that maybe there was 
something to it because there was some web site with "details of 
possible trajectories and everything." Morons.

You people are wimps. The only real effect of the good doctor's rants 
has been, as Mr. May indicated, to get the good doctor on the "don't 
hire" list.

You get off your ass and find out directly.

How about if you know exactly who it is, but you know him to be 
judgement-proof, since he's already saddled with over $12 million in 
libel and wrongful-death suits? It's called "reputation capital."

People are just going to have to be smarter than they've ever been. The 
Net enables sharing and verifying real information just as it enables 
disinformation. Sure disinformation will always be cheaper to produce 
and more appealing to the eye (fact is harder to accept than fiction 
because fictional plots are written to make sense), but disinformation 
tends to cancel itself out.

Work on archives, reputation control, and openness. Disinformation, to 
be truly effective, requires a monopoly on information. More speech, not 
less.

(Keep in reserve the retort that anonymity is quite big in "the 
mainstream," too. How many key stories cite "well-placed 
administration sources"?)

The opposite of the Black Unicorn approach to nym safety is the Liz 
Taylor approach: "As long as they spell my name right, I don't care."
Nobody I care about is going to listen to some crank, or if they do, 
they'll email me to check the facts, or if they don't, I have 
alternative outlets for information. As long as I live in a free country 
with a free Internet, they can't touch me.

Oh, btw, it's helped that I've resigned myself to forever working for 
decent people who don't give in to such bullshit.
