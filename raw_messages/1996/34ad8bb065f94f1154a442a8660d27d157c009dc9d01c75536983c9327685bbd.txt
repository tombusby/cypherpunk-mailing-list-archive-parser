	I wouldn't personally use AOL in any event, but their use of
their computers is their business. I do have some doubts as to whether
AOL subscribers necessarily signed on for this - as noted on the
list-managers list, a consent arrangement would thus be preferable. The
other argument of the Cyber Promotions jerks is nonsense - how does AOL
blocking affect the rest of the Internet?

>PHILADELPHIA, Pa. (Sep 6, 1996 12:23 p.m. EDT) -- A federal judge has =

>Pending a trial tentatively scheduled for Nov. 12, U.S. District Judge =

>Cyber Promotions controls three of the five sites blocked by AOL. The =

>AOL attorney David Phillips said the company was considering an appeal. =
>He said AOL customers had been "complaining vociferously about Cyber =
>Promotions' junk mail."

>"We feel that America Online has violated the civil rights of their =

>which AOL does not own," he said.

>Although unsolicited mail sent through the post office in the United =
>States is not considered illegal, the rules have yet to be defined in =
>cyberspace. The larger services -- AOL, Prodigy and Compuserve -- all =
>have policies forbidding mass junk mailings
