After getting another batch of bounce messages from Microsoft's Postmaster,
I have reluctantly decided to filter out all messages from Microsoft.com
until they fix this problem with Microsoft Exchange.

Their latest message was:

Rather than fight their misconfigured mail system, or try to convince them
to change their ways so as to conform to accepted practices, I'll just use
technology.
