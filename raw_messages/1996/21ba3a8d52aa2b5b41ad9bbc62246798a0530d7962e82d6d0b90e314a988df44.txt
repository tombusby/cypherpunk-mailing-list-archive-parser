In the very early 80's while I was attending UT Austin the FBI approached
the libraries and requested access to the loan records. The libraries
refused and went so far as to post a warning at each of the book checkout
points on the event.

Personaly, I was very proud of them for the refusal and the extra step
of the warning.

I have been dealing with security electronics for over 10 years and have
never been approached by anyone regarding my activities. I make no secret of
the fact that I do that sort of work as well as being able to build custom
equipment if needed. I would suspect that there is a flag on your friend
for something or someone from the past, not on his business in particular.
