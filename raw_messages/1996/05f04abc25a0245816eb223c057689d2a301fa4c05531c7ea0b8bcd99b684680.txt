I don't know what Tim May will tell you, but over 10 years ago a technology 
was developed which is something like a scanning electron microscope, 
however with very low beam energies and is designed to be able to scan a 
chip and quantitatively measure the voltage at various/all points on the 
chip.  It can be thwarted by a thick coating on the chip, but most organic 
coatings can be removed with  a "plasma asher," a chamber designed to remove 
photoresist coatings on chips.
