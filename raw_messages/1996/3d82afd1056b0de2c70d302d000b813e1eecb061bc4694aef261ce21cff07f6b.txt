BTW, the last two telephone numbers are no longer active at my residence.  I
haven't tried them to see if they've already been assigned to other people.
I would have hoped that anybody who went through the limited research (they
well all listed telephone numbers, BTW; I've NEVER had an unlisted telephone
number) to find them would have  at least called to verify that they were no
longer valid numbers.
