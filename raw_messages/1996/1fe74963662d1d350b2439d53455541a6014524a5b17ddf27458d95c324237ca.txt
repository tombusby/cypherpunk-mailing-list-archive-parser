Not exactly. Win32 API's include the ability for a program to impersonate any 
known user. Besides ActiveX (OLE really) has nothing to do with services. 

In order to make ActiveX secure there would need to be a virtual machine with 
access to a limitted API only. Sound familiar?

There is no such thing on WinNT.

Why is that a problem? ActiveX components are shipped as discrete objects with 
a known DLL like interface. DLL's are unloaded when the load counter is zero so 
they don't hang around in memory after the ActiveX job is done. You also cannot 
write a "proxy to the file system" in a DLL. That's a special device driver 
called a filter. Of course there is this Mark Russinovich fellow that is 
showing how this is not exactly true. It is possible to identify all entry 
points in a DLL.
