However more capital, relative to labor, influences demand, and more
labor, relative to capital, influences supply.

But in practice, the mobility of capital and the importance of labor
is such that this has little effect.  How much capital do you need
to provide a job for a software engineer?  The major determinant of 
someones value on the international market is who has coercive power 
over him, not the national supply of capital. Capital does not
come from nations, but from individuals.
