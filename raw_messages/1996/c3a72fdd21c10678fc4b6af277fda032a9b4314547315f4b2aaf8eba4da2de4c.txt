MAPI is in part of the Win32 SDK, whichi is available on MSDN level 2,
in the \mstools\mapi subdirectory.

http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/mapi/ is the MAPI home page.

http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/mapi/internet.htm has some good
MAPI/Exchange resource pointers.

http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/ is a new site for downloading parts
of the SDK online, but it is just getting started (i.e., i'm not sure
that the MAPI part is ready yet).

as for the other question about Outlook -vs- Exchange, see
http://www.microsoft.com/outlook/documents/emailfs/default.htm for a
comparison.
