I have a very crude + simple remailer using shell scripts.
There is re-ordering and a standard message size.
There is no scope for receipts or replies.

I limit messages to 1kb to make it harder to send images.
(There was once a management complaint about images- nothing
to do with me or the remailer which hadn't started then.)

It can only send and receive mail INSIDE the company.

I have not advertised it widely, for fear of a management veto.
It carries a warning to be sensible, and I'd be able to read
the mail log following complaints.

There is a short banned list, intended only to stop looping.

Um, some of us really do speak English.  To the point where we struggle
to make out Larry King and guest both mumbling away at high speed.
