So how many keys can (for example) a 100 MHz Pentium try per second?  I 
assume it's known-plaintext.  Even at a million per second, that's still 
somewhere around 35 billion machine-seconds (average) to find the solution.  
1000 systems operating, and it's around a year to a solution.  Doable, but 
not all that practical.


What about the possibility of using DSP's?  Is there any brand of 28.8 K 
modem which uses a "standard" DSP and EPROM firmware?  Such a beast might be 
the easiest way to get a large amount of CPU horsepower operating 
independently of the host computer.  DSP's are optimized to execute a large 
number of instructions with little I/O needs.
