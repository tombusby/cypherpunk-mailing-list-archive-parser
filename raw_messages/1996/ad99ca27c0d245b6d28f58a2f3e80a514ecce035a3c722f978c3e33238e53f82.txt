I believe that micropayments will revolutionize business
transactions, and that they are entirely feasible, and have
written on the subject on cpunks intermittently. NS starts
out with some opposite assumptions, which I don't really
think are entirely plausible.

dunno what you are talking about here. with micropayments, why would
you necessarily have statements? you're using an old billing model
on a new paradigm. please establish a *context*. it would be ridiculous
if people submitted "microbills" to companies that responded with
"micropayments". that's the wrong model.

here's how people are talking about micropayments. imagine that
you see a link with a little 5c sign next to it. that means when
you click on it, you are automatically debited 5c. your own browser
can handle keeping your own records. the transaction occurs when
you hit the button. the idea of a bill being submitted, that you seem to
be suggesting with your idea, doesn't make sense. another example:
downloading an FTP file.  the whole idea of billing is thrown away
in favor of immediate processing.

  On the other hand, a statement too complex to

again, this doesn't make sense at all to me. "statements, bills, 
summaries"-- these are all things you require for larger size
transactions. if after a day of net surfing I have spent $3.16,
and my browser kept a record of every case where I paid it out,
what's the problem? the browser does not pay unless I click somewhere.
nobody submits bills to my browser.  all actions are initiated by
me.

"fundamental cognnitive bottleneck"?? not in my brain. perhaps you
should check your own equipment <g>

  One proposed solution to this has been "intelligent 
>agents".  But since these agents are programmed remotely, not by the

it doesn't make sense at all for one to give autonomous capability
to agents to spend money, at least until they have been refined.
I don't see where agents fit into this all in the beginning. you're
putting the cart before the horse. I've never seen micropayments
discussed in the context you are putting them in. (no wonder it
is causing you "cognitive dissonance"). the uses you cite may not
appear until long into the future. in the meantime the model I wrote
about above has no problems you cite that I can tell.

  By

you are tackling a different problem. "how can we get reliable agents
that can be trusted with buying decisions". this has nothing or little
to do with "the feasibility of micropayments". micropayments are not
necessarily tied to agents.

imagine a user who controls his own wallet. he knows when he is paying
from that wallet. you seem to have this idea that outsiders could
make queries to that wallet that would be hard for the consumer to
keep track of. this makes no sense to me. the wallet action will always
be tied with some other action. the user picks up the phone to dial
somewhere, and it says, "that will be .3c-- will you pay"? he says
yes. 

>A micropayments system assumes a solution to the billing problem.

as I wrote, I don't imagine a billing system at all in terms of
micropayments. its the wrong model. in a billing system, the bill
and the action are not tied tightly together. person does [x] and
receives bill 3 days later or whatever. with micropayments, you
will have instantaneous transactions.

wow, I think I've solved it. you can nominate me for some award
now <g>
