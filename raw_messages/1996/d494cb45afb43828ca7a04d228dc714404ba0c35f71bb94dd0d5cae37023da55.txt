There are several vendors offering 2.4GHz wireless with ranges up to 20
miles. Though the 900MHz stuff is much cheaper. Unless you have a pager
cell on your roof, 900MHz should serve you fine.

If you don't want to build your own, there are various vendors that use the
NEC 900MHz bridge card in their products. Or just buy the card, get an old
486, and round up the software from somone.

Assuming Eudora for Mac: Download MacPGP Control.
