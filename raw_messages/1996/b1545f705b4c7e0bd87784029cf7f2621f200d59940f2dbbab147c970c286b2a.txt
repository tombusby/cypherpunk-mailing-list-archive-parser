     "Monopoly", or editorial policy and it is solved by buying a press of 
some kind, from a letter press to a photocopier, and printing all the news 
he does, and doesn't.

     No, we just need to use the words we have properly.

     "Violent-censorship" is when you [shoot beat kill] the speaker, "non-
violent" is when you imprison, or consficate the means of speech/replication of 
speach, or otherwise "silence" without physcial force. Then you have censorship 
by intimidation, which is a little harder to qualify. If I threaten to burn 
your press if you talk about Crypto, or print Crypto algorythms, is that 
censorship? IMO, yes. If you _choose_ not to discuss Crypto because you 
understand (or are afraid of) the implications of it, that is NOT censorship,
any more than my refusal to discuss sports because I can't understand the appeal
or because I think that sports are generally a bad thing.  
 
     Choice is not censorship, removal of choice is.
