Looks like a real technical discussion instead of a flame - obviously the
wrong list :-)

I don't know that package, but most of them act as wrappers around
DOS PGP rather than filtering keystrokes or doing PGP internals.

There are several risks - getting your secret ring, getting your passphrase,
getting the RSA parameters without the passphrase itself.
Obviously, having your secret key ring file leak is not good,
but the fun parts _are_ IDEA-encrypted using your passphrases,
so it's not too much of a risk.  Having the passphrase or the
raw keys stolen would obviously be worse.

DOS/Windows is _not_ a secure operating system, if you believe
that there's more than one person in the universe.  (DOS doesn't
believe that, so in some sense it's perfectly secure. :-)
Nathaniel Borenstein's recent postings are a good reminder that
keystrokes can be stolen, easily, in that environment.

Without source code, if you're not a programmer, the things to look for are
circumstantial evidence - is the copy of the program you got off the server
PGP-signed by the purported author?  Or by any programmers you trust?
That doesn't tell you the program is trustable, but it does tell you if
it's a fake replacing the real thing.  Is the real thing trustable?
(Well, probably...)

There's also the problem of leaking your key back to the Bad Guys,
but that's easy - the program could leak it out in your PGP messages
(either obviously, as a second recipient, or in subtle nasty ways
like playing with the system clock on timestamps.)
