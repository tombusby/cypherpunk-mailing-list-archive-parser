A point of clarification:

It's not the bodies that are baptized, but the spirits, by proxy.
You don't think we dig 'em up do you?

The point being that even if you've never heard of Christ 
(a billion people in China for example) you've still got a shot.
Most christian religions don't allow for that.

I mention this in case any of the folks who are being subjected to
this discussion on this list were wondering what the heck you
were talking about.  We are a missionary church, after all.

As far as the COS goes...Well, a lot of info that the Mormon church 
would prefer to keep secret has been published, but I don't think
the First Presidency has been running around suing everyone.
