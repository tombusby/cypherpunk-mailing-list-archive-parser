It's illegal in Germany to publish material denying the holocaust.  In
the same moment this guy sent his book (?) per snail-mail from Canada
to Germany he commited a crime here in Germany.

I don't think it's astonishing that Denmark imprissoned this guy and
transported him to Germany.  It's a normal thing that one country
imprisons a criminal another country is searching and the delivers
him/her to the country in question.


Have a nice day!
