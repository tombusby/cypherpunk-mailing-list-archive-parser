Someone asked a few days ago what US companies are doing to oppose ITAR. 
many of them are taking public positions on the ProCODE bill. Another of
the things they are doing is deploying strong crypto domestically.  (Arun
Mehta and Tim May have detailed the mechanisms why this domestic deployment
will have world-wide impact.)

Here is a start at a list of such companies:

Community ConneXion - Too much to mention, Thanks Sameer
IBM - The Anarchistic Key Authorization system (from U of Texas), 
   see 6th Usenix Security Symposium proceedings
Netscape - SSL
PGP Inc - 'nuff said
Sun Microsystems - SKIP implementation, PGP v3 implementation

Please add to the list.  We should recognize and remember our friends.
