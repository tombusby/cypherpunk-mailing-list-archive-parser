Huh? I didn't even notice.   Well, I guess after a few months of promoting
"Assassination Politics", I'm so thick-skinned that nothing fazes me anymore.

The reason I'd prefer most of the discussion on the list is simple:  I have
a limited amount of time, and I'm promoting an idea.  If you have a good
argument that I should be able to address, I want everyone to have the
benefit not only of your comment but also my response!

e-mail with you.

I'll read it.  However, my mail has slowed to a trickle today.  There's
something wrong, somewhere.  It'll come flooding in, in a few hours I'll bet.


>You will certainly understand my argument.  I'd be delighted if you can
prove me wrong.

We shall see...
