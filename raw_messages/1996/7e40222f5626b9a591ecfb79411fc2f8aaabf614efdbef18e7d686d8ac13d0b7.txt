Wrong.   They're not _identical_, but on the other hand it is indeed similar 
in many respects.  Remember, "complying with a federal regulation" is 
actually a misleading statement:  If _any_ leeway is allowed
in how to "comply," the organization involved is, presumably, liable for the 
exercise of that freedom.  Or, at least, they should be if the rules were 
followed.  

While admittedly this is an off-the-wall example, if a bank reported these 
transactions by sending them by car driven by a license-free 16-year old, 
and he lost control and killed a dozen people in a crowd, the fact that the 
bank "was complying with a federal regulation" wouldn't save them from hefty 
liability.
