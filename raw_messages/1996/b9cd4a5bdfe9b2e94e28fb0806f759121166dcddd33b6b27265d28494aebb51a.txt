OTOH, one could argue that their lack of attention to daily matters was
what allowed them to be 'great' in the first place. Picture a Mozart on
Ritalin.

Boss - "Hey, Wolfgang, thanks for getting that presentation together so
quick, it really impressed our client. And that was a really snappy jingle
you wrote for the opening slide show, too ..."

So, he's a 'great' worker at the office, and undoubtably undergoes nowhere
near the mental stress he would off Ritalin. But I cannot, for the life of
me, imagine _this_ man writing the music that the non-medicated Mozart did.

So should the medication you take be decided by the area in which you want
to be successful ? (or even better, vice versa: Personality engineering,
here we come).
