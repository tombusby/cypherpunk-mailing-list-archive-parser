We have worked extensively with MS Mail and providing integrated crypto
features for the product.  The native security on the files is provided in
two ways:  1)  The usually poor MS "scrambling" (it's not really crypto),
and 2) The discretionary access controls (DAC) of the OS.  Since only NT
has decent DAC (which only works at a C2 level of trust when it's not on a
network), my opinion of the risk level would be "VERY HIGH" against
threats of repudiation, loss of confidentiality, loss of availability, and
loss of integrity. 

Further, the I&A mechanisms in everything other than a stand-alone NT
environment are inadequate for any real proof of identity.  They most
certainly can't offer anything close to a real non-repudiation solution.
Forging a "from" header into the database is, I would contend, fairly
simple.  Reading someone else's mail is a bit harder, but not incredibly
difficult.  If traditional hacking doesn't work, building a hacking tool
using MAPI (widely available API to the mail subsystem) would be fairly
straight-forward (Hmmmmm - Summer vacation programming project???).
