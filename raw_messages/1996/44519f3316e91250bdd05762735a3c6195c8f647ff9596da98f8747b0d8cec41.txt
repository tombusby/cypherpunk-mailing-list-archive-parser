Thanks for the sources.  More money is going to get dumped into cryptobooks
soon.  (I am amazed how little exists on the web on the topic.) I had seen a
few of the books at a local bookstore, but I was uncertain of their quality.
(They also had a number of snake-oil crypto books.)

The author has failed to call me back.  I do have some serious concerns
about the code.  (There is not a single XOR used, except to clear
registers!)  I am starting to suspect that it is based on a mathematical
progression based on the numbers 40, 28, 36.  I need to spend a bit of time
on the code with a debugger to find out just where that segment of code is
located.  (Should not take too long...  Just have to make the time.)

The web info for back issues listed a web page from a publisher that had no
listing for them on the server.  I will be sending mail to get more info...

Still an interesting topic...

I am trying to convince him of the futility of the task.  (It is hard as his
ego keeps getting in the way.)  I just want to give him reasons why it is
weak and not just glittering generalities.

Thanks again for the book references!
