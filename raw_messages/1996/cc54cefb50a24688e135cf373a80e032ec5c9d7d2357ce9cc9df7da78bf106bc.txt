If Forbes was the current Republican canidate, the nation would be spending
itself into debt dealing with all of the therapy bills resulting from their
childrens minds being irreversably damaged from looking at the Forbe's smile
on the news every night.  Forbes looks to me like H.P. Lovecraft tried to
design a cannidate.  What Eldrich bargains has he made to get to any sort of
public acceptance with a smile like that?

I have seen little to no coverage of the Libretarians this (or any) year.
And even less coverage than usual now that they have a canidate who is even
worth voting for.  (I guess I won't vote for Pat Paulsen after all...)

As for the Perotbots...  Maybe someone should tell them what "perot" means
in French.

And if Dole wins and dies in office, they could just pickle him and no one
would notice.  It would not be the first time we had a dill-dole running the
country.
