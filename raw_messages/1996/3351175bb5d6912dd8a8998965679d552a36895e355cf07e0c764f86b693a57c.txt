  Event Information, Speakers, and Agenda



   On July 1, 1996 in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, members
   of Congress and prominent computer industry leaders and privacy
   advocates will meet to discuss the need to reform U.S. encryption
   policy.

   Encryption technologies, the "locks and keys" of the Information Age,
   are an essential component of a secure and trusted Global Information
   Infrastructure. Every day, millions of dollars in commercial
   transactions and the private communications of individuals traverse
   the global network. All are vulnerable to the prying eyes of
   industrial spies, hackers, and rogue foreign governments.

   Computer users need strong encryption technology to protect themselves
   online, and U.S. businesses need the ability to export strong
   encryption in order to build a secure Global Information
   Infrastructure.

   Yet current U.S. export controls and other limits on encryption
   technology are limiting the widespread availability of strong,
   easy-to-use privacy and security products. As a result, these policies
   are stifling the growth of electronic commerce, preventing computer
   users from protecting their privacy, and handicapping U.S. industry in
   the global marketplace. Until these cold war barriers are removed, the
   full potential of the Internet and the future of electronic commerce
   will never be realized.

   National and local press are encouraged to attend this high profile
   event. For more information, please contact Danielle Kolb or Alan
   Davidson at the Center for Democracy and Technology, +1 202 637 9800.
