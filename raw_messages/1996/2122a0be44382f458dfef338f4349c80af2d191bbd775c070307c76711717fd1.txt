AFAIK, when I do mem /c in a dos windows, under W3.11wg, it seems to report
all processes that I expect that would be running in the machine.

It reports win something processes,
it reports realdeal, cd-rom drivers and everything (I think...)

Can anybody Wizzard-type can reply on this one?

Or RTFM us with the proper references...

Thanks and Regards
