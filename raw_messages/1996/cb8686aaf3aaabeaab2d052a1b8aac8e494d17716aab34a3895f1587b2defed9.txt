Foo.  There's so much totally outrageous stuff the government _does_
that we don't have to go giving them ideas about _more_ things to do.

And ethics aside (:-), bogus rumours get you lumped in with the folks who
think Space Aliens fired that shot from the Grassy Knoll in a plot
to kidnap Elvis.  It's hard enough not to get treated like that
when you're telling the truth, especially about issues where the
government knows it's cheating.

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
  and the politicians had to count them all.
