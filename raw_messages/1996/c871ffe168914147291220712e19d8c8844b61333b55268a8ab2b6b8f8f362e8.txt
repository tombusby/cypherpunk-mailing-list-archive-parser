Yeah, I know it can be hacked.  I also know that if they are that interested
in sex, NOTHING I do is going to stop them.  (Which is as it should be.  If
they have no exposure to any sexual material as a youth, some rather nasty
problems tend to crop up as adults. (Take a look at the studies of sexual
predators.) But that is a point avoided by the moralists...)

talk about them as if they will have useful features.  They will be about as
useful as the ratings on video games.  ("Hey, theres a cool one!  This one
has flying mangled bodies!  Its OK though.  No sex!")
