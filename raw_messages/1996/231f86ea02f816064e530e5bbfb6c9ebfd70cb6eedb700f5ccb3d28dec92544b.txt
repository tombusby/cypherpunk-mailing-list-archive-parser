This relates to something I have been wondering about:  If one could
get one's company to pay one in electronic cash, what is to stop one
from piling the coins in a Datahaven somewhere (assuming one existed
that would be usable for these purposes) and say to the IRS: Money?
What money?  Can you find any of my money?  I, uhh... lost it!  Yeah,
that's it!!
