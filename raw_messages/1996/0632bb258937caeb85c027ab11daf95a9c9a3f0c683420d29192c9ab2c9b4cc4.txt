Japanese Ambassador Kichisaburo Nomura and Special Ambassador Saburo Kurusu
were to present Secretary of State Cordell Hull a Declaration of War at 1pm
Washington time on Dec. 7th. To achieve technical compliance with
international rules it was intended to be delivered approx. 30 minutes prior
to the actual attack. There were decoding difficulties however and it was
delivered after the attack. Neither of the Ambassadors is thought to have
had any knowledge of the actual attack and therefore did not understand the
criticality of delivery. Japan intended to go to war with the United States,
Great Britian, and Holland over their policies concerning the Japanese
presence in China and Manchuria.
