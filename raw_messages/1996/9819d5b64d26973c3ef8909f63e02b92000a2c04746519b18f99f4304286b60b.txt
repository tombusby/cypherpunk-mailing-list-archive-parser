I strongly urge anyone who uses PGP on a regular basis to take a look 
at Pronto Secure. 

It is a fully featured Windows e-mail client with complete & seamless 
PGP integration in its native implementation. Security features 
include: Single click for encrypt sign or decrypt, on the fly 
authentication, key management, talks to the keyservers, intuitive & 
flexible certification / trust management, automated key exchange 
between Pronto Secure clients & more.

The product is in final beta & this will probably be the last 
opportunity to get a free registered copy. We believe that we have a 
pretty secure e-mail client. However before releasing Pronto Secure to 
a less security aware public, we would like to submit the product for 
additional scrutiny by the members of this list. With this objective in 
mind, we have decided to extend our special offer to beta testers: Any 
tester providing us with feedback on the product will automatically be 
eligible for a free copy of the soon to be released Pronto Secure 1.0.

For a detailed specification see http://www.commtouch.com/s-mail.html
To check out what our existing beta testers have said about Pronto 
Secure: http://www.commtouch.com/testers.htm

To apply for the beta send signed mail to secure@commtouch.com. 
Also please attach your PGP key.

I take this opportunity to thank all members of the list who have up to 
now assisted in beta-testing the product. Your input has helped make 
Pronto Secure into what we believe is a truely usable secure e-mail 
client.
