This has only marginal relevance to the list, but I'll mention in case it
helps a crypto coder out there: be wary of _ever_ using undocumented
features of a processor, compiler, or other system.

Why? Because "undocumented features" are not promises made by the vendor,
and may vanish in the next release (or, worse, change behavior in strange
and hard-to-detect ways).

We witnessed this several times at Intel with the x86 line. Various
customers discovered "undocumented features," made the mistake of
exploiting them, and then came crying to us when iterations of the
processor (what we call "steppings") took out the "features" or altered
their behavior. (And for a while there was even a rift between the Intel
versions and the NEC versions, which copied some Intel processors and
copied the undocumented features....when Intel was no longer supporting
them, the two processor families diverged, causing chaos.)

So, beware.
