My employer experienced this problem -- I thought it was related to the
cashe clearing problem in 4.9.4 on some platforms and upgraded to 4.9.4P1
(FreeBSD 2.1.0) -- which appears to have solved the problem for us. 

info-sys.home.vix.com:/pub/bind/release/4.9.4/bind-4.9.4-P1.tar.gz

Not sure if it -really- fixes the problem or if we've been lucky since.
