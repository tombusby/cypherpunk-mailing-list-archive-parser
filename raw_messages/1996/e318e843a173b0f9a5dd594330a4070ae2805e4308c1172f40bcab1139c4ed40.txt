THE JEWS (ALL of them!) Try to kick Ernst Zundel off Usenet!!

Recently several Jewish co-conspirators have tried to silence
me!  I finally go onto Usenet to make myself open for debate,
and the Communist conspirators write to the AOL postmaster
and ask that they remove my account!

Below are some messages I received from some of those
people who do not believe in Free Speech.  *I* believe in 
Free Speech.  Without Free Speech, I would be unable to
declare which books I feel should be burned, who should
be persecuted, and who should be declared to be inferior
or part of a race-wide conspiracy like the "Holocaust."

Please do not send email to the people who complained
about me.  I beleive in Free Speech, and so I believe in
their right to complain about me.  I also believe that it
just demonstrates that they are willing Fellow Travelers
in the worldwide Communist Conspiracy, they are friends
of the Black Helicopters of the United Nations, and they are
enemies of the Aryan Nazi UFO's at the center of the Earth.

Now, fellow Patriots and Supermen Aryans, read their
messages and tell me what you think?

>> Dear Sir/Madam:

>> An American Online user is repeatedly violating AOL's Terms of Service
>> on USENET.  Please read a sample post below.

>> He is a controversial Canadian publisher, Ernst Zundel,
>> who beleives in "Free Speech."  I personally do *NOT*
>> believe in "Free Speech" because I am a Jewish Communist. 
>> His continued posting from AOL could bring legal action
>> against your company, because that is what Jewish Communists
>> like me do.  It is the only way to keep the Aryan Space Nazi
>> UFO Mothership from vaporizing the world.

>> Please correct this problem by informing the user of his
>> politically incorrect activity.

>> Thank you.

*** Now do you see what kind of censorship I am up against???

If you want to help me, please DO NOT email the people above to complain.

Instead, you can help me in my cause to make the Earth safe for White
children.
You can help me by joining me and my legions of Aryan Nazi UFO Supermen
at the center of the Earth.  All you have to do to get there is enter the
Earth's center by way of a volcano in Antarctica.

If you are a *true* Patriot, and a *true* Aryan, then you *MUST*
make the journey to Antarctica and into the volcano!!  We owe it to
the world, we owe it to the great Adolph Hitler, and we owe it to
the White Race.

And please bring a sweater.  It's cold!
