Nope, that is from the black man.  In JET Magazine, they say "NIGGAZ,"
and they are the nationwide authority on the black subculture.

If you do not read JET, you do not know anything about the blacks,
unless you live next to them like we do in the city here.

"Soul Brothers" hate "niggers," because a "nigger" is defined 
as somebody who:

1) lies,
2) cheats,
3) steals,
4) stinks, or
5) fucks with your woman.


There are	good blacks and bad niggers,
		good jews and bad kikes
		good dagos and bad wops
		good gay boys and bad faggots
		good ladies and bad cunts
		
		good and bad of all kind...
