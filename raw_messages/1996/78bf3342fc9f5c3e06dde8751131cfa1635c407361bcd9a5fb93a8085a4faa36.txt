	The person who wishes to keep those troops in Northern Ireland
	is the head of an extremely dysfunctional family.

	The current occupant of 10 Downing street simply contributes

	The idea was first proposed 200 + years ago. Computer technology
	simply makes it easier to implement.

	And the press in that day had a hard time dealing with it,
	because in denouncing it, they spread the idea that maybe
	it is a good thing.   Ignored, it becomes forgotten.  Denounced,
	it becomes a cause celebre.

	Do that op-ed piece --- but remember that AP is not a libertarian
	position. Libertarian's think that government is a good thing.
	AP thinks that government is a bad thing, and their philosophical
	differences get wider, from there.
