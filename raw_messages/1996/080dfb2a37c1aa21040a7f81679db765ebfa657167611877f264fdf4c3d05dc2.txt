There was a lively debate in feminist/legal circles a while back about
introducing "the reasonable woman standard," "the reasonable gay man
standard," etc. into the legal currency. The movement intended to make
"date rape" and sexual harassment easier to prosecute. I didn't keep up
with it, but I'm sure the relevant papers are still being cited. I doubt 
and hope that no court ever took the argument seriously.

My personal rules are:

1. I have the right to get offended however often I want. It's a lot
   healthier than desensitization.

2. I have the right to respond however I want, as long as it's legal and 
   ethical.

3. I do not have the right to tell someone else not to be offended.

4. I do not have the right to control another's actions, much less words
   or thoughts, merely because I find them offensive.
