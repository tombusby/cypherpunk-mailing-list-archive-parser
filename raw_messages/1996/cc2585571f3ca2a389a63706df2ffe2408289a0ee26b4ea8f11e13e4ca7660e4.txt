Dear folks at C2, 
 
If people don't ask you to be placed on a mailing list they jolly well
don't have to follow *your* instructions to get taken off. 
 
You can keep me and other people on "clueless" until we do what you want.
But you can neither force other people to do it nor avoid getting a
reputation for e-mail harassment for your "cute" games.
