Totally different from a DC-Net, as far as I understand DC-Nets (I think 
I do, but Applied Crypto's in my dorm, and I'm at home, so I can't check)

In this approach, computers are organized in "rings"; each computer in a 
given ring always has an encrypted packet in circulation.

When the group of packets arrives at a given station, it replaces its 
current encrypted packet with a new packet; if it doesn't have any new 
packets to send, it puts up a garbage packet that is indistinguishable 
from a normal packet. It then scans all the other packets and attempts to 
decrypt them with its private key. Any it can read, it does; all the 
packets are forwarded to the next station in the ring.

By the time the next set of packets arrives, all have been replaced; the 
station is unable to determine either the source or the destination of 
any given packet. Routing between loops is done by routers, which are 
computers on multiple loops. Perhaps all machines are on multiple loops 
and serve as routers.

I'm not sure about traffic analysis in cases where Mallet controls a 
significant portion of the network; while this is unlikely, it must be 
considered.

Any significant inconsistancies are probably mine...
