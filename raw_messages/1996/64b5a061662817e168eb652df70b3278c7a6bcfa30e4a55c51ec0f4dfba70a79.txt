So our ideas on implementation are similar, except you have made the 
distinction that anyone on the "free" list can have direct access.  
Unfortunately, your idea pivots on the idea spam has exploded to unbearable
proportions.  My complaint on this isn't your idea, it's the projection
such an event may occur.  While I hope this plan won't ever be necessary,
at least not on such a global scale, the application of such techniques
toward a mailing list sounds decent.  I'm still thinking about how I would
go about charging WRT mailing lists;  anonymous postings are puzzling me
at the moment.  Which brings up another topic:  How would an anonymous
remailer operate?  It's hard to eliminate an audit trail when there is some
monetary tie back to you, whether it be credit card, ecash (assuming they
never quite figure out anonymizing it), ...
