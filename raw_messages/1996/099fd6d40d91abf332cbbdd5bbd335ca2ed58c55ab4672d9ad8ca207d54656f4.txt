The context of the discussion wasn't TEMPEST (as you say,
it's not enough for that), but new high-frequency hand-held radar imaging,
which ostensibly uses radio emissions from human skin or some technique
to create images.  Foil-backed insulation ought to do a good job
stopping that, as well as making infared snooping less useful.

Now, the police _claim_ that the product that lets you see the
shape of objects under people's clothes has the resolution to find
guns and knives and non-naughty-bits of human flesh, but not enough
to let those dirty-minded privacy-invaders leer at their victims.  Uh huh.
At least they probably don't come with printers or data links,
so they'll just have to leer at the screen and not save and distribute
copies....  Somebody ought to complain to Phyllis Schlafly about this!
