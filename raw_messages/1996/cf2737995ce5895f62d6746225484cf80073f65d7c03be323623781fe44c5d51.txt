It's ironic that I get such e-mail even though I'm not even subscribed to
cypherpunks or coderpunks anymore. (I've been deleted from both lists several
times w/o asking, apparently by the list owner; I resubscribed; so now
majordomo@toad.com has been instructed to ignore all requests from me).

I guess this illustrates again Tim May's and John Gilmore's love of
free speech. :-)
