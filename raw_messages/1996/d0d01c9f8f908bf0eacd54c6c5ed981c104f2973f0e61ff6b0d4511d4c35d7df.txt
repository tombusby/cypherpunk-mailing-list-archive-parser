Why am I any more mistaken  for pointing out that a single influential
member of EFF's staff or board is anti-anonymity and yet remains with the
organization than you are for pointing out that a single influential
member who happened to be anti-anonymity has left?

If my position, as you represent, is misguided, surely your point about
Mr. Johnson is equally so.  If the board is almost 100% pro-anonymity,
where's the official position?

In so far as an organization is much defined by those involved, I think it
entirely right to wonder aloud about the personal motives of the staff and
board.  I think this PARTICULARLY prudent given EFF's reputation and prior
conduct.

I would be most happy to be proven wrong and see EFF suddenly, in a burst
of impressive moral fiber, speak out publically and take some political
action to assure anonymous communication.

Well, let's have a clear official position issued then to end all dispute.

Maybe there should be an EFF position on the matter.

What is EFF doing if not supporting anonyminity?

I'm hardly going to support an organization that proports to be
pro-internet freedom and yet has no official position on anonyminity.  Of
course you should expect people to wonder about EFF when you have no
official position and yet some staff and board members seem to have a
statist
bent.
