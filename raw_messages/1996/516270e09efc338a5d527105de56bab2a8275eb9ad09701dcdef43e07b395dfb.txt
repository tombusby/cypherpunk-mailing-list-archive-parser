As has been mentioned, this is a good situation for the use of some
kind of escrow. Not meaning to talk about crypto or anything, but it
seems to me that there's already some good shamir sharing code out there,
I hope the overworked, underpaid PGP 3.0 people put shamir sharing
capabilities. I see it as a slight modification of the split/merge
code, which PGP already has, plus already written shamir code that
hopefully need only be cut-and-pasted into PGP.

This is what non-GAK escrow people want, right? Easy-to-use strong-crypto
escrow?
