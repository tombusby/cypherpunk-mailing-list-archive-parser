You just admitted that the bank was ready, willing, and able to report the 
tranactions without regard to whether they fit within some specific, fixed 
standard.  That being the case, and presuming somebody was aware enough of 
the practices to realize this (which the lawyer presumably was), then 
there's no evidence that doing what the lawyer did would "keep the bank from 
complying with the law."  (How, exactly, was the lawyer to know whether or 
not any particular action would actually achieve the result you claimed he 
wanted?)

Apparently, I presumed wrong.  The thugs are even more thuggish than I had 
imagined.  Whether or not any such prohibition is constitutional is another 
issue, however.  The fact that anybody would attempt to write such a 
restriction into law says a lot about them, however!

I would argue that if the bank can be forced to help the government enforce 
the law, the bank should also become liable for damage done as a consequence 
of complying with such requirements.  While it's a different area, within 
the last few years a decision was made (SC?) that companies which had made 
Agent Orange for the US Government during Vietnam can be held liable 
(without recourse against the government, apparently) for the damages caused 
ex-servicemen for selling dioxin-tained Agent Orange to the government, but 
manufactured totally according to government specifications.  (and used only 
outside the US, under government direction, by government agents, in an 
entirely different legal jurisdiction, to boot!)   Seemingly, doing 
something at the behest of government does not immunize one.

I have none.  But then again, I don't have to.  Unless "guilty until proven 
innocent" has been adopted as a standard of proof in American courts.  Do 
you know something we don't?

BTW, gambling pools like this are supposed to be illegal, aren't they?  
Isn't it odd when government seems to stop enforcing laws unless it's 
profitable to do so?
