Not at all.  I'm worried about similar respnses to my original post given my
instable base.  :)

I don't pretend to understand how every system on the market works, especially
those that have "PC" somewhere in their offficial or onufficial name.

# If you're talking about Windows NT or 95, for example, the winsock.dll

[See the caveat above.]

The thing to remember, with Java is that it's "platform independant" and thus
the security of Java as a whole will be the product of its parts.

# Real operating systems are probably a bit more standard about what they 
# do with DNS lookups, but I'm sure there's variance.

There is.  Actually its "real OS's" that I worry about most.  If you run
idenmtd, it might be possible for a java applet to determine who invoked it.
If fingerd (or any other service) allows and responds to connections from
127.0.0.1 (ie. localhost...)

I didn't state it explicitly, but that's exactly my point.

# This bait & switch thang can really be generalized to any kind of attack. 
# Of course, it's traceable, since not that many people own or can spoof a

Traceable by what?  If my assumptions are correct (which I'm willing to admit
that they might not be) all the attacker has to spoof is name to address for a
name that he/she already controls.  I don't expect that most PCs and/or
Macintosh's do this as a matter of course.  Most firewalls probably do, but I
wouldn't count on it.
