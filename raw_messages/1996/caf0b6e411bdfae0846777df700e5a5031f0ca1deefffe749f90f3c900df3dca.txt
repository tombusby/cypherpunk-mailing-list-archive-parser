Well, maybe McL. would have spit such nonsense, very characteristical of him.

"The media is the message" is among the biggests con jobs performed on humanity.
It's like having a guy dying form thirst and telling him: "The pipe is the beverage"...

One fine example of the destruction of reason.

If a PGP encrypted message was sent to Mr.McLuhan, could he see if it is a
"there is a contract on you..." or "happy new year" or "I love you..."


To any Cypherpunks, the media *IS NOT* the message!

Dear Wired peoples and Mr. McLuhan: get lost!

     He is partially right.  With Renaissance, came the idea that Reason and human mind 
were powerfull and that knowledge, because man's only survival tool is reason, is a value 
to pursue.  

But french revolution did not convey theses ideas, neither
did Napoleon.  And Hitler definitely not.   
All of the three were, ultimately, collectivists or looters.

Therefore, the author of the text is guilty of setting up straw man and of
context blanking.
