= I would really like to see a remailer that is somehow blinded.  
=   
	on a message basis --it is not really possible if the logs are 
    maintained or the fed are already monitoring the stream --which is 
    probable if they are after something --and it will increase 
    geometically if we get Bubba again.  
  
	there are a number of very sophisticated ways to play the game,  
but 
    each requires a real "Web of Silence"  --what makes your  
counterpart 
    reliable?  where do we establish that "Web of Trust" which everyone 
    bandies about. 
 
        who are the two plants for our current chain? or is this just 
    another case of sowing dissension by the feds?  I only know two or  
    three at most of the players on the remailers at all --and that is  
a 
    passing knowledge, not acquaintance. 
  
= I don't know enough about how mail paths are generatered, but is it  
= impossible to conceal the origin of remailer postings?  
= 
        impossible to conceal each orientation, but I have been playing  
    with several easy techniques which are sufficiently obfuscatory  
    that the Feds will not have the horsepower to break them unless  
    someone provides them with the methodology --that in itself  
violates 
    how we (cp) have always insisted on 'post it' and get on with the 
    attempted destruction.  even if they break the methodology, they  
    gain very little v. the technique. 
 
= Postings made to remailernym@alpha.c2.org would be spit out 
= somewhere but = without accountability?  
=  
        sure, possible if you wish to play the game with a "Web of  
    silence." 
  
= Impossible?  Would do wonders defeating traffic analysis.  
=  
        no, not impoosible. just who wants to be responsible for  
    something the NSA assholes can not own --and compromise?  they get  
    down right shitty when they kick your door down in the middle of  
the 
    night as take your carcass away --if nothing else works, off to  
    Springfield you go --without charges --lest we forget the crippled  
    president or Hustler magazine  --that is what they did to him  
    _before_ they convicted him, _and_ after. 
  
= I'd consider running a remailer, but after listening to the response  
to  
= the anonymous poster a while back, it sounds like there are few if  
any  
= simple options which do not require major time and effort to setup  
and  
= run.  
=  
        you can run it out of your client account on an IAP --there's  
    nothing special about it in a simplified form. 
 
        I could support a remailer point if I could manage to get the  
    necessary "Web of Silence" counterparts --one them preferable  
    foreign. 
 
        BTW, it does not need to be complex to add another level of  
    confusion. usually the best offensives are the simplest.

jimbell@pacifier.com  
= 
        is this subtle, crass, or just not?

Overseeing first-rate programmers is a managerial challenge 
  roughly comparable to herding cats.
