	Hi Mr. McCoy, My name is Petro, and I _am_ a poor libertarian
(well, sort of a libertarian, I tend to think they are a little short
sighted, and a little to authoritarian to me)  Many of us ARE poor. We may
not _like_ being poor, and some of us are working to get out of that
situation, but most of us don't "hate" the poor. We (well, I) hate people
with their hands out. This is everyone from poor people who _won't_ try to
get out of their situation, to Multi-billion dollar corporations that
recieve government grants for over seas advertising to old people who
didn't plan for their "golden years"  and expect us to provide the gold.

	Is it evil to ask people to work for their sustanence? Is it evil
to ask someone to work to get out of the situation? Is it evil to demand a
system based on reward for work, rather than a reward for being a squeaky
wheel?

	Because you and your kind have been fscking up every other country
on this planet that has acheived a decent technological base. Let US have
this one.
