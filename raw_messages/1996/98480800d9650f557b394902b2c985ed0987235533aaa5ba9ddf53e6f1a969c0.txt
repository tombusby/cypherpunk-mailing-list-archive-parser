I just downloaded a copy of Ishmail ( http://www.ishmail.com) and I'm
really impressed. I have a few things to tweek ( I installed it in the
wrong directory so I have to be root for the moment ) but the interface
to PGP is transparent.. smooth as a baby's a** !! I had a couple of
questions, and they were answered very quickly.  I found something I
really like !! well worth the price for the UNIX / LINUX weenies (IMHO)
