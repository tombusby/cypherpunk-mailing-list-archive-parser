And therefor I write:

	Of course that would be in a microsoft-less world where there wasn't one
company who controlled huge market shares, who dominated the industry and
who didn't have both government and 'big business' in their pocket. 
Microsoft is the great 'teflon corportation' able to shake off controversy
after controversy regarding everything from hostile marketing strategies to
product dumping.
	Since Microsoft already maintains a virtual monopoly I don't see how
making the user pay will serve justice.  In your world we'd have to pay for
whatever inferiour product is handed to us... not only limiting our choice
and freedom but making Microsoft that much more powerful.
	
My two bits, take it or leave it.
