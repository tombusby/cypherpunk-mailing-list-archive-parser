I don't think this satisfies the requirements.  Once Bob calculates H'
and sees that it matches H, he knows that Alice likes him, but Alice
doesn't know that he likes her.  The whole point of the protocol was to
be fair.  Bob must only learn that Alice likes him if Alice is guaranteed
to learn that he likes her.

I have posted an alternate solution in another message.
