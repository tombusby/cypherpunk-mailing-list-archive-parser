While I'm not up on all of the wrinkles, I've seen this reported as an
attack on the penet anonymous mail forwarder and news poster.

An attacker forges email in your name, requesting an anon-id.
 
The server creates one, and sends the report both to you, and to
the attacker's address.

If you try posting thru the penet server, the post gets anonymized
using the anon-id the attacker created.

The attacker can now link the anonymized post to your True Name.


If you ever intend to use the penet anon server, you should write
to the server administrator, requesting to have the id the attacker
created deleted, and the create a new one, with password protection.
(I don't use penet, so I don't know the details).
