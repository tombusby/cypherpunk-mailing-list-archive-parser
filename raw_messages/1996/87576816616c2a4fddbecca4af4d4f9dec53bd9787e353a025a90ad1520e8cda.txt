I wrote a reply to this, about decoder cloning and fingerprinting, but my
Mac froze up for some reason...must be a message. Maybe I'll rewrite it...

Then I saw this comment, and my sense of irony was triggered:

I wrote a paper on this, "Dynamic Fault Imaging," using voltage contrast
combined with image processing and chip data bases to locate the origins of
glitches and faults in microprocessors. However, voltage contrast is a lot
older than 10 years, and was in use in the early 70s--my group just
developed a kind of "time machine" for watching the propagation of
defective states inside complex logic devices.

Using such methods to look at the internal state of logic or memory devices
is incredibly difficult, though a sufficiently determined analyst might
discover some interesting things. (Check the archives for several articles
I've written on tamper-resistant and tamper-responding hardware.)

Hardware fingerprinting is an economic win over reverse-engineering
analysis to the extent that it costs a huge amount more to get a particular
key than the value of what's in the key.
