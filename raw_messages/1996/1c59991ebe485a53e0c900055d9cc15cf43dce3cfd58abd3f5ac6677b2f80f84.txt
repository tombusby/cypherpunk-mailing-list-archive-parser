The story I heard (about 1983) was that IBM had pulled a rather fast one on Digital Research, the source of CP/M for 8080's and CP/M 86.  They lured DR into an exclusive contract in which they offered to pay a percentage of the sales to DR on CP/M 86 for the IBM PC, but then deliberately offered it at such a high price (about $250 or so) that "nobody" wanted it.  Because the contract was "exclusive" even Digital Research was locked out of the market.  By the time that contract expired the market was firmly in the hands of MSDOS. In effect, DR had sold the entire market for a song.  Had they been more careful it might have been a horse race. 

This was identified as an intentional tactic of IBM, BTW.
