Then the banks just need to be more careful about issuing it, huh?

Which, interestingly enough, is exactly the reason citizens should support 
it.  Barry Goldwater, the 1964 US Presidential candidate, said something 
like "Any government that is powerful enough to give you everything you 
want, is powerful enough to take away everything you have."    It was true, 
then, and it's true today.

Fast-forward to 1996:  Any government powerful enough to be able to 
eliminate money-laundering is powerful enough to eliminate all of our 
rights. I'm not willing to take that risk, and the way I see it, people who 
see digital cash as an undesirable risk to government are a risk to me.


Meister announced that, if necessary, the EU

Maybe somebody should tell Herr Meister that should actions of government be 
threatening, "Citizens would take counter-measures, should restrictions on 
computer money and reloadable payment cards endanger their rights."
