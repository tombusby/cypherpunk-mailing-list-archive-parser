It helped; thank you. It was several days before I figured out which list 
I was not receiving mail from :-)

I'm forwarding this to the list because I would like to note that, after 
checking with majordomo (which I _should_ have done beforehand, but 
didn't think to) that I was unsubscribed from the list.

I didn't ask to be unsubscribed from the list; if (which I doubt) the 
user list was restored from a backup, I would almost certainly have been 
on it, as I've been on the list for a while now.

This leads me to believe that somebody else unsubscribed me. *sigh* Is 
there any way to find out for certain (ie does the majordomo@toad.com 
keep logs)?
