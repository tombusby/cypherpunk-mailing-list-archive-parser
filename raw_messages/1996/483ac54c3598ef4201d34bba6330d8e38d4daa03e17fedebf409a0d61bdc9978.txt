  And the door was unlocked. One thing about spooks. They love locks.
I mean, they REALLY love locks.

  Let's see if I have this streight.

  Colby got up from a working dinner, left the computer on, walked out
the door without locking it, got into his canoe without wearing his usual
life jacket and vanished from the middle of a placid stream.

  That about it?




  You know, maybe just having him vanish WASN'T the best way to deal with
internet questions after all.
