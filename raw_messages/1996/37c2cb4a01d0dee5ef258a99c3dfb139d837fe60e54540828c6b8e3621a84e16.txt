Forget the law.  If you don't plea-bargain, you have to face the jury.

What's the jury gonna do?  Depends on a mixture of their own knowledge
and feelings, and whatever instructions the judge gives them.

1. Your state of mind re: defending yourself will influence the jury.
2. The judge's instruction as to necessary force will influence them.
   (Understand that your situation is not the same as a police officer)
3. The jury's decision about whether your actions were appropriate,
   based on what they think your options or rights were.

Juries do not, in my memory, let people off the hook when they shoot
a person who is suspected, say, of raping their child, as the woman
did in (the Bay area?) a couple years ago.

OTOH, juries do sometimes allow pretty amazing extenuations.  The case
in Meigs County Tenn. circa 1986-87, when the man in the bar was being
harrassed by acquaintances - he went out to his truck, got some guns,
and came back in and blasted two or three guys.  He got off clean.
