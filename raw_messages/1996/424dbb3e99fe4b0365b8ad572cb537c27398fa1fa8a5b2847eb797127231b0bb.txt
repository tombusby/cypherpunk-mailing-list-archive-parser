Hate the sin but not the sinner? :)

It really is irrelavent weather the reduction in freedoms is cause by "evil conspiritors"
or "well intentioned patriots". The end result is the same. When you wake-up one day and
find that every thing you say & everything you do falls under the watchfull eye of "Big
Brother" will you really care how things got that way?

See this is where you & I part ways. It is a Presidents responciblity as it is the
responcibility of all civil servants wether elected or appointed or hired. They all take
an oath of office To protect & defend the Constitution against all enemies foriegn &
domestic ... Not the country, not the "big picture", not the current establishment but the
Constitution. The cornerstone that the Constitution is built on is that the People are in
charge. Not the FBI, not the NSA, not the CIA, not the Joint Cheifs but the People. It
also says that the power of the governmnet is limited, they can only do so much and no
more. All rights & powers not explicitly given to the goverment belong to the People. This
doesn't mean that well if we have a really good reason or if we lie real good about it we
can over step out authority. NO it means what it says only this and no more!! Big Picture
be damed!! I doubt that the People would take much comfort know that they had all been
sold into slavery but it was necisary for the Big Picture.

I never claimed infinite rights I claimed inalienable rights there is a difference.
Infinite rights implies rights without ends. Inalienable rights implies rights that can
not be taken away. They are my rights reguardless of the efforts of petty would be
dictators or government bureaucrats. They may conduct them selfs in a manor that violate
my rights but that does not mean that I no longer have those rights.

I never claimed any "conspiracy". No mention of the Tri-Lateral Commision or New World
Order. :)

I am just pointing out what is happening here and now. Our elected officals, appointed
officers, and government employes are disregarding the Constitution and violating out
rights. I could care less why. I want it stoped and stoped now. I will do what ever is
nessicary to inform others that this is happening and hopefully convince them that this
should stop. If some one steals your car do you really car if it was a lone "crack head"
that did it or an orginized criminal cospiracy (MOB) that did it? It is wrong, it is
illegal, and it must stop.
