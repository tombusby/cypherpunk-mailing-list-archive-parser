For some reason I find seeing satellites flying in formation rather
disturbing. The classic 3-4-5 right triangle makes somebody's math easier,
I'm sure. I have watched the sky for 20 years and seeing that pattern glide
across the sky made we wonder just what the shuttle is doing up there. How
many satellites have been placed in orbit? How precise are their positions?
