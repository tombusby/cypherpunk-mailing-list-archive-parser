The other problem is that the proposed Authenticode system and other "signed
applet" systems only provide accountability after the fact.  This is little
help when your hard drive is toast and the only proof you had was a logfile
which was the first thing erased...  The illusion that only "trusted software
puslishers" will be given blanket authorization is a pipe dream: users are
sheep who will hit that "OK" dialog box as many times as necessary to get the
tasty treat they are anticipating (and there is actual experimental evidence
to back this up :)  I expect that the first post-Authenticode ActiveX virus
will be one to modify the signature checking routines or add additional keys
to the registry which makes the second round of the attack appear to be a
valid OS update from Microsoft. What exactly does a signature get you other
than someone to point a finger at?  In case you don't read those legal weasel
words in software licenses there is no claim made that the product will work
as intended and the company does warn you that if the product fries your
disk then it is not their fault...

The state of the art was up to it quite a while ago.  Check out KeyKOS and
other OSes which use capability semantics for access control.  Rather than
the all or nothing approach to security which is currently built into Java
and continued with the code signing initiatives (albeit allowing you to
delegate responsibility regarding trust) what is needed is to extend the
signatures to granting the capability to perform a certain task and nothing
more.  If the signature could express things like "this ActiveX control
needs access to a writable file in C:\WINDOWS\TEMP which will not exceed
1 Megabyte in size" then the system would be flexible enough to succeed
and would allow users to express much more complex trust relationships than
the simple boolean expressions which current code signing mechanisms allow.
