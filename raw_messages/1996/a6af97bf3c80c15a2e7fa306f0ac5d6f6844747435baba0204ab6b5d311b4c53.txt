Or better still, run one remailer on the machine, and use it multiple
times in the chain.  It seems to me that one remailer on a machine is
better than several because it will allow more mixing of messages.  If
two messages enter a machine and later leave, it may be possible to
distinguish them if they went to different remailers and left with
different From: addresses (or other header fields) as a result.  If they
had both gone to the same remailer it would be harder to tell them
apart.

I understand that there may be political reasons to have the machine
owner and remailer operator be separate (although AFAIK the reasoning
behind this is untested), but technically it seems better to have one
remailer per machine based on traffic analysis issues.
