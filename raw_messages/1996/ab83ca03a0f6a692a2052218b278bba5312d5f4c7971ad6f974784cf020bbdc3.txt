Most people put up an "email to:" button on a public page for 
communications related to what's on the page. It's quite a stretch to 
assume that this invites any and all email from anyone who cares to send 
whatever they want. I can't say I've ever seen one that said "Please send 
SPAM(tm) to:" ...

However, since others may think like you, I guess I'll have to add a line
above my link stating that email not related to the purpose of my site
will be happily proof-read at the rate of $200 per hour, 1 hour per 60
lines, minimum. Perhaps I'll get lucky. If I get a big enough chunk of 
SPAM(tm), it might be worth the costs of breaking down the anonymity.

Until know, I'd never really figured out what causes lawyers.  :)

No, this b.s. is more like having someone put a dead skunk in my mailbox, 
with no return address, trying to prevent me from sending them 100 dead 
skunks as a return favor. And about as welcome.
