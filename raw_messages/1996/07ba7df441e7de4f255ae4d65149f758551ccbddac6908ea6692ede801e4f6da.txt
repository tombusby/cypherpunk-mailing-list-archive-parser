Is is arguable?  Maybe, but only if you specify the exact context. The
Enigma stuff happened when the world was as war, and the peoples that
would have used such things in the same context as DES is used now
were non-existent.

The case of covering-up knowledge of DES and Enigma are quite
different because happening in different *contexts* .

But maybe the govt is keeping the population in ignorance, not telling
them that a war *is* going on *now* ?

Some peoples believe that words have an intrinsic meaning outside of
their appropriate context.  You can usually find specimens of this
group either in political circles or in Voodoo ceremonies.
