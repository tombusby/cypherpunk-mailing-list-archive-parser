Rich:

You assume I did little research; this assumption is incorrect. Did you
actually read the documents your search turned up, including the ones in
Swedish? 

I spent a few hours last night reading documents that Altavista found,
including the U.S. State Department's report on human rights in Zambia
under Chiluba. It says in part: 

     Police often ignore procedural requirements and engage in abusive
     and brutal behavior, including beating and at times killing criminal
     suspects and detainees... The press and other media continued to run
     afoul of legal restraints on freedom of expression and suffered
     political reprisals for expressing independent views.

I also read enough back issues of _The Post_ to get a feel for their
editorial tone, and even if they had ties to the former dictator (an
assertion you don't back up), their recent coverage of events was not
unfair, IMHO. 

I've also read three reports by the Media Institute of South Africa
(MISA), calling for sanctions and a withholding of foreign aid to Zambia
for their human rights abuses, especially of members of the media. I
agree, and I also called for pressure through foreign aid. 

You seem to be unduly critical of my report. *shrug* I don't expect
everyone to agree with me, and I suppose I should be happy that you think
I'm "95% right," whatever that means.

-Declan
