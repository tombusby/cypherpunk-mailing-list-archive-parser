I doubt any of the Congressjerks know what's in the thing they've voting
on, either. This is the American way: wait 'til the last minute, pull a
couple of "all nighters," go on vacation, and then claim ignorance. It
worked when we were in school, so, hey, why not run the government the same
way?

("I had no idea of what was in the Communications Decency Act...it just
sounded like the "decent" thing to vote for."....."You mean the
Anti-Terrorism Bill suspends habeus corpus? What's that? I'll ask my
staffers to look into it.")

Fuck 'em all. Fawkes had it wrong...they're not worth the powder to blow
'em to hell.

All we can do is work on technological workarounds. Making their $2 billion
Wiretap Boondoggle a worthless exercise is a start.
