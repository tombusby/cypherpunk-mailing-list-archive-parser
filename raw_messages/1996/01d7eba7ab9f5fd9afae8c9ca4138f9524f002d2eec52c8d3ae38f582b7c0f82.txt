Another suggestion: The Republic of the Seychelles. Saw an AP article on 
them over the weekend. Seems they now (since November, if I remember the 
article correctly) offer unconditional haven for anyone who has $10,000,000 
(didn't specify if in US$). No extradition, guaranteed, no matter what the 
crime, if perpetrated anywhere else in the world. Instant citizenship, no 
questions asked.

What about using converted freighters offshore in international waters
for storing the computers? i.e. Sameer the Wolfman Jack of Pirate Internet 
Services (tm)  

I was told that Belize is offering passports for the next two years for 
$50,000 
and that might be even less if offers were made to the government to provide 

low cost Internet access to the citizens of Belize.

Belize has always been known as a home for pirates, A wonderful Cypherpunk
candidate for an offshore data haven!
