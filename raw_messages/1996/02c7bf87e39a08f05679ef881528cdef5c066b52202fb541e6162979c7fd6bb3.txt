Careful Alan; I didn't write that.

That was qut@netcom.com, the latest addition to my killfile,
who replied to my private email on Cypherpunks, and, rather oddly,
called me a Mormon.

Message in question appended.

The only thing your type of "cypherpunk" has
to say, is blather about liability, copyrights,
and other capitali$t bs.

REAL crypto-anarchists, of course, want the
destruction of copyrights, trademarks, and
other weapons of capitali$m, and will
implement crypto-anonymonity to proceed
forthwith.

I was talking about netnews, mormon.

There's already hundreds of groups like
that, stupid.  It will be implemented,
whether you like it or not.
