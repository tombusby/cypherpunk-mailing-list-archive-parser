If his true passion is fractals and raytracing, then why would he expend
energy 
things other than fractals and raytracing.  He may be an anarchict but wish
to invest his time 
in fractals and raytracing rather than in explaining anarchy.

If his true passion were re-mailers and anonymity then he would spend pages
and pages writing about them rather than just admitting to supporting them.
