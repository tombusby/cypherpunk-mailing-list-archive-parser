Unfortunately, what you find "hard to believe" I find easy to believe.  
Remember, if this bill is passes, it doesn't merely affect YOU, it affects 
ME.  So I suggest the burden of proof is on YOU to show that these 
provisions aren't going to be maliciously interpreted by the courts.

I'm not a lawyer, but I assume neither are you.  Please explain the LEGAL 
DEFINTION of "in furtherance of a felony."  If you can't, then you simply 
don't know how far they will go.  And you're depending on the reasonableness 
of the government for the interpretion.

What you think is irrelevant.  Most people probably didn't realize what the 
government did in the Amateur Action BBS case was "legal," either.  But they 
did it anyway.

Are you assuming that you have the key?  Remember, if you run an encrypted 
anonymous remailer, and assuming you do it honestly, you won't be keeping 
records as to the source of the note.

Thus, if they "serve a warrant" and you CAN'T decrypt the message (or tell 
them where it came from) then why aren't you already guilty?  Remember, the 
wording of the proposed law doesn't require that you have full knowledge of 
the crime involved, merely that you act "in furtherance" of it...   If you 
don't possess the key, but you explicitly ran your remailer so that you 
never it, just so you couldn't relinquish it, you have structured your 
operation too thwart any investigations.  You are ALREADY guilty.  This may 
not sound reasonable, but the government no longer (if it ever did) 
considers "reasonableness" to be an impediment to their actions.

Question:  What, exactly, is the motivation of a person running an anonymous 
remailer?  His motivation is clear:  To allow people to send anonymously 
untraceable messages.  Assuming he's of ordinary levels of intelligence or 
beyond, he is aware that somebody may some day use his system for illegal 
purposes.  You're going to have to explain why a court _CAN'T_ interpret 
this as being in violation of the law.

Your optimism is touching.  It is also vastly misguided.

Gee, I wish you were right, but my experience with government thugs says 
that they will do anything they think they can get away with.

I don't "condemn the entire bill."  I would, however, reject the entire bill 
if that provision remains.  And morever, if we make a serious attempt to 
have it removed, the more they resist removing it the more we should insist 
it go.

There would still be a problem.  What's the definition of "actually involved 
in committing the felony"?  Are you aware, for example, that manufacturers 
of small plastic screw-top vials have been prosecuted and convicted simply 
because their vials could be used to hold small quantities of drugs such as 
cocaine and crack?  This was a case from a few years back, BTW.  I wish I 
could remember the cite.

If you're not aware of these things, WAKE UP!  Your optimism disgusts me, 
because it is entirely unrealistic and based on a rose-colored-glasses view 
of the government.

Why would "those that are in the middle" object to a bill which is little 
more than a re-statement of rights we already believe we have?!?

There is no viable middle ground here.  Any tool can be abused.

On the contrary, my opinion is "The _government_ is a serious problem that 
we are already having a terrible time dealing with."   Fortunately, I've 
found a solution, and the government is trying as hard as it can to prevent 
it (and "crypto-anarchy" in general) from taking root.

Ha ha!  That's rich!  There is no reason that a "pro-encryption" bill has to 
contain any general "anti-crime" clauses.  The average person is afraid of
burglars, 
muggers, murderers, rapists, car thieves.  When is the last time the average 
person was the victim of a crime whose investigation could be "thwarted" by 
the use of encryption?  If you can't think of an example, you've just proved 
my point:  This provision is entirely irrelevant to the average citizen (at 
least in a "positive" way) and can't be considered a "win" for him.
