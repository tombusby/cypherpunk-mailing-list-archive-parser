How would you know what the *intent* of these other people is in placing
mailme: tags on their public pages unless you have been to the specific
pages. You speak only for yourself, yet you try to imply that you speak for
everyone on the www who has placed a mailto: tag on their pages.

Would it make a difference if the message to the webmasters mailto: buttons
said "Nice webpages you have, when you get a moment check out my designs".
Remember the thread is about an Artist who sent out only his URL to
encourage visitors. This is and was a NON commercial site.

*Respectability* is subjective to the definer...

Without a disclaimer on the box stating specifically what cannot be placed
in it there can be no knowing what the boxholder finds of personal interest...

Inane, off-thread, unsupported weak analogous attempts at reasoned argument
received, but not read - simply deleted, for $1000/message. Sending OR
posting the above to me or a Newsgroup that I may happen to read constitutes
your accord and acceptance of the above contract. If I must read them, the
fee is $2000/message.
