Two reports on BSA's letter Monday to Gore opposing crypto 
export regulations as "headed in the wrong direction." And
claims the administration has "significantly backtracked" since
announcing the new policy October 1. IBM, MS, et al are 
withdrawing earlier support for it.

Without change, BSA said, encryption export policies will fail as 
did Administration policy of Clipper.
