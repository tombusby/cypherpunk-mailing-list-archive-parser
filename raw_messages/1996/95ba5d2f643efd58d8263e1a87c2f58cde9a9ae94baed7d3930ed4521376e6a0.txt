If there are no common-mode sources, xoring two streams will not reduce the
entropy.  If you use PGP's keyboard timings for one stream, and (e.g.) disk
drive randomness for the other, the output of the xor of the two streams
should have at least as much entropy as the best of the two.

However, I would be worried if /dev/random and PGP were both using keyboard
timings to generate entropy.
