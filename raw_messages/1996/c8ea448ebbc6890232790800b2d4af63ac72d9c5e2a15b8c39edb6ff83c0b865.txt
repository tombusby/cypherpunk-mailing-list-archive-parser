I've noticed quite a few, actually.  I don't know how many are regular
readers but there seems to be enough to maintain a steady undercurrent of
legal thinking on the issues associated with digital commerce, some
anonymity and First Amendment issues, a sprinkling of criminal law topics,
and of course, banking, intellectual property, SEC, antitrust, general
contract, and related commercial law.

Or they automatically delete any posts that come from or relate to the 
puerile bullshit Bell is infamous for, and choose not to get dragged into 
this type of time- and bandwidth- wasting garbage.  Of which this post is 
just another, of course, but i get so damn sick and tired of the constant 
imposition of 'AP' and related nonsense on this list.  Of late, the 
trolls seems to be particularly effective among people who should know 
better, and an aura of credence or relevance has developed around some of 
this crap.  Can't we just ignore it, and move on?  Maybe if we ignore him 
he'll go away.

I would be satisfied if they just outlawed e-mail about it.
