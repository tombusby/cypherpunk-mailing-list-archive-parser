I hope you're not serious.

In case you are:
It seems to be typical of American beliefs that Israelis are good, and
everybody else "down there" is bad. On the other hand, Israel wouldn't stand
a chance if US weren't having them as a pet. They are getting more and more
fundamentalistic (yes, there are zionistic fundamentalists, big surprise)
and they are not one bit better than anyone around.

It seems to me, that a few hothead terrorists create the image of all arabic
people in western heads. Consider this: Islam is a lot younger then
Christianity. If the Islamic people act like the Christian people we will
have a huge problem. A few hundred years ago everybody who didn't agree with
the pope was killed (Earth is flat after all). Now, according to my
timekeeping, Islam should reach that state around 2100. So there is plenty
of time for them to get nastier. (I don't think they will, because Islam is
a bit more tolerant than christianity ever was).

ps: I'm not Islamic, nor will I ever be, but I don't like fundamentalists,
and your views, should they be serious, sound *VERY* fundamentalist to me.
