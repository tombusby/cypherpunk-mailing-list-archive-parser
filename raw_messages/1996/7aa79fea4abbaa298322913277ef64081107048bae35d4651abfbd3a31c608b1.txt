Someone sent me some US income tax figures. It would seem that the vast
majority of personal taxes are paid by the rich and high-end upper-middle.
So I'll eat my words and agree with you, talking about the rich makes
quite a bit of sense. I sort of do wonder how many of those "corporations"
are small businesses and individuals working as companies. Time for me to
go find a national stats book. 

Of course only talking about the rich makes things so much easier.
