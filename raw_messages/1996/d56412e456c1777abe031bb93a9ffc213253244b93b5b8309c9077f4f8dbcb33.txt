    Tim,
      I m not getting the mailing list for cypherpunks . This is the 
second no third time that I know about where entire lists have 
disappearedon me. One was religoius , but I wrote that off as them not 
liking my handle. Then I got a notice from the nueron digest that my mail 
was bouncing back to them and that they were cancelling my sub. That was 
ok too as I wasn't THAT interested in them .Now my beloved Cypherpunks is 
not being deliverd to my door(computer)and that hurt (even with the 
flaming and noise). Have I been left off because I get too much mail to 
my provider?Is it because I have recently only lurked and added nothing 
of worth? Anything else? 
                        Thanks in Advance
                               moroni
