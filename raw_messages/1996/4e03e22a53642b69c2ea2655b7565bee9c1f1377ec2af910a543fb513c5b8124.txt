This was upheld by another recent case involving an anonymous pamphlet from
an Ohio woman.

The new rule doesn't require that ID be presented at the Post Office.  You
just  have to present the package in person and fill out a form.  They
could try and require ID later, of course.

They have to identify themselves they don't have to present identification
(an important distinction).  Brian also pointed out that the guy could have

If they have yet to successfully mandate positive ID for bank or credit
accounts, how can they expect to successfully mandate positive ID for
something as ephemeral as an Email account?

Though they have not done so over the several centuries we've had anonymous
postal mail.
