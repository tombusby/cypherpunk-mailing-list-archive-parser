And I agree with your points, too, Sameer. Like I said, I mean no
disrespect to you that you issue press releases in which you interview
yourself...it's the form that press releases take, and it's the form that
"slides down easily" into a newspaper story. (The form makes it look as
though the journalist has conducted the interview and gotten the quotes.)

And at least most of Community Connexion's press releases have been about
new services being offered, or rewards, etc. And not given vastly more
attention than they deserve (as was the case with the FV "discovery").

I really hope this media frenzy with all things related to the Internet
will burn itself out.
