I've set up another mirror site at Carnegie Mellon University. In my
mind, the mirror archive exists to demonstrate the folly and the
danger of Internet censorship. It's in is in the AFS directory:
  /afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/declan/www/Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views/

You can access it from the following web servers at these URLs:
  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/declan/www/Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views/
  http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~declan/Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views/
  http://web.mit.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/declan/www/Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views/

These servers are fairly robust and load-balanced, and I believe it will
difficult for attacks to succeed against them. In addition, anyone
with access to the globally-distributed AFS network can just cd into
the above AFS directory and read Zundel's files. Some German AFS sites
include, but are not limited to:

   afs-math.zib-berlin.de
   fh-heilbronn.de
   geo.uni-koeln.de
   lrz-muenchen.de
   hrzone.th-darmstadt.de
   mathematik.uni-stuttgart.de
   rhrk.uni-kl.de
   rrz.uni-koeln.de
   rus-cip.uni-stuttgart.de
   tu-chemnitz.de
   urz.uni-heidelberg.de

Deutsche Telekom's hostname-based censorship has already cut off
German users from over 1,500 U.S. businesses, including electronic and
computer businesses, art stores, online banks, and and even the Port
Douglas Visitors Bureau for Queensland, Australia.

If the German government forces Deutsche Telekom to block access to
web servers at Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Stanford
University, it will be slicing off communications with three of the
most respected universities in the United States.
