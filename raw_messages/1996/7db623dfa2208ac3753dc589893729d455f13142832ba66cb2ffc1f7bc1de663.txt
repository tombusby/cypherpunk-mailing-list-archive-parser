According to Bartlett's, this is attributed to Martin Niemoeller (1892-1984):

    In Germany they came first for the Communists, and I didn't speak up
    because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I
    didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the
    trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade
    unionist. Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak
    up because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and by
    that time no one was left to speak up. [John Bartlett, _Familiar
    Quotations_, ed. by Justin Kaplan (16th ed.; Boston: Little, Brown and
    Company; 1992), p. 684]
