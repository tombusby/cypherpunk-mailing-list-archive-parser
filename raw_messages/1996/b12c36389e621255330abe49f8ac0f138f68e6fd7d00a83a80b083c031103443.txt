Are you saying that you are anti-corporation?  That would make
no sense.  Many corporations are very benificial to society.  Take
Shell for example.  It did all that it could to save the life of
that guy in Nigeria, but the "libertarians" who instantly boycotted
Shell would have you belive that they encouraged the sentence.

What is becoming a major export?  Weak laws?  Why would a country 
encourage criminals to come to it's boarders?

I don't think you have analysed the situation.  It was the regulating
that deystroyed the UK cattel industry and put the entire world at
risk.  The British government protected the beef industry despite a
ban on British beef accross Europe.  If Eroupe is considered to be the
"Free Market" as you suggest, then it would be exactly opposite to what
you have suggested.  The "Free Market" labled the animals coming from
Britian to be of questionable quality.  The regualtors in Britian 
disaggreed because it would cost them a few penny's to slauter the 
infected heards.  Then Britians started getting sick.  The rest of the
world throws up bans of British beef; Yet the British regulators still
do not cleanse the heards.  The only way to ensure the desease is gone
is to kill every last cow in Britian and bring in fresh stock.  THAT
MEANS NO GIVING THEM TO INDIA YOU STUPID FUCKS.

This is another interesting point.  Why is it better for a company to
agree to any regulation?  Do you REALLY trust Microsoft?  I do not.
They write poor code.  They probably signed the aggreement because they
knew that there product was so bad that it couldn't violate any 
restrictions or they contracted the work out to the NSA who wrote the
code for them and so they know that it can be cracked if they need to 
track down every last copy of the OS for their marketing group to do a
statistical analysis on.

I belive that this is the GOVERNMENT body called the BBC.  We have a 
similary group up here called the Communist Broadcast Corporation.
Actually, I must be fair to them,  I do like Air Farce.  I don't think
your argument holds any water.  Different cultures have different social
norms.  I was quite shocked to see John Clease stark f**king naked on a
tea commercial (isn't tea a carrier of caffine? yes. Does caffine change
the way in which you body works? yes.  Is caffine food? no; therefore 
caffine is a drug and tea carries that drug.)

So?  All this proves is that the US is more oreiented toward the free 
market than other places.  In the free market, on's "brand value" is 
incredibly important.  I think you are also missing the distinction
between a company and it's marketing.  I'm sure Hoover, as in your
example, has many marketing camnpaines going on at any time and that
every so often an overeager director of the comapany that Hoover hired
to do the campain makes a mistake.  I'm sure this happens all the time,
just take a look at another marketing company: Microsoft.

Does that mean a libertarian is more Free Market oriented or more
Command Market oriented?  I'm not sure there is any correlation at
all.  I belive in anti trust laws, does that mean I can object to 
regualtions?
