Yes. I was connected to one when I was about 5 years old. I am 43
now.

My psychiatrist was doing tests on me at that time.

The device was made by a company called Grass Instruments. It was
located at the James Jackson Putman's Childrens' Center, which is
located in Roxbury, which is near Boston, Mass. 

My psychiatrist, who is Dr. Norman Paul, now on the medical school
faculty at Harvard University would know more about it and about 
the company.
