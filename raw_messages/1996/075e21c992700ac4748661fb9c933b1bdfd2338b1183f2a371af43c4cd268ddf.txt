Do you mean Timmy May's "don't hire" list?

I wonder if companies other than John Gilmore's "Cygnus Support" honors Timmy
May's list of unemployables. Of course, the way to get hired by Cygnus is to
give a blow job to John Gilmore while wearing a red ribbon on your scrotum.

By the way, the Net.Scum site that Timmy whines about is currently up at:

 http://www.fileita.it/webitalia/netscum

Check it out - several prominent "cypher punks" are described.
