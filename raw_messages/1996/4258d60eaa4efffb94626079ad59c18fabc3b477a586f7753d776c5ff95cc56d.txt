This isn't really cypherpunks material, but since we *have* had so many
threads on the Co$ (for better or for worse), here are some recommended
sources of information:

(1)  Ron Newman's Web Page.  
     http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/home.html

(2)  Marina Chong's a.r.s. Web Page summary.  
     http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/marina.html

(3)  The Usenet group alt.religion.scientology.  (High volume).

I'd recommend visiting (1) first, as it provides excellent background
information.  (2) provides a good master index to Scientology information
(both pro and con) on the net, and provides a good starting point for
exhaustive surfing.  (3) is the standard discussion group.

Hope this helps!

And now back to our regularly scheduled crypto discussion...
