I didn't mean that an U.S. citizen should relocate and develop in Taiwan.
Why do that when almost all Taiwanese CS speak, read and write fluent
english.  Just develop the specs and contract for programming.  There are
many companies waiting to take you business .

BTW, there a several U.S. companies (e.g., Typhoon Software,
typhoon@typhoon.com) which can manage the development of a wide variety of
software projects (including crypto code) by highly qualified personel in
the former Soviet Republics.  For comfort, the software can be tested in
the U.S. (just to make sure no trapdoors have been insered by the Russian
Mafia ;-)
