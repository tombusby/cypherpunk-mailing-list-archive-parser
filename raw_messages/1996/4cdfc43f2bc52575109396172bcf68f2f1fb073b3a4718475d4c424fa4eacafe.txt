But to attempt to define "SPAM" (unless you're Armour) is dangerous. This
whole notion of "unwanted mail" is ill-defined and not something "the law"
should get involved in, in my view. (And CP technologies certainly are
consistent with this, e.g., placing the role of screening on those who set
up gates, not on tracking down True Names for prosecution.)

As the legal eagles will tell you, the essence of a contract is a two-way
agreed upon set of terms, not a one-way "if you send me mail I decide I
don't want, you will have incurred a charge of $1000." Try enforcing your
$200 an hour "proofreading charge" in any court in the land.

(I've been saying this thing for several years. Who knows, maybe Rabit
Wombat was the first to use it. Whatever, it's as unenforceable and
meaningless now as it was several years ago.)

In the case of actual USPS mailboxes, there are laws which prevent others
from using them (e.g., no UPS or FedEx deliveries). For sure, dead skunks
can be placed in mailboxes, or under porches, or whatever. The law can't
fix everything.
