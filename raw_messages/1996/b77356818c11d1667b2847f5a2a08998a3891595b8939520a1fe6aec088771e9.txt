>Hi  reagle@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:

        Huh, can I ask who you purchased this list from and how much was my
privacy bought/sold for? (I might have sold it cheaper! <grin>)

>You can log onto my web site http://www.directnet.com/~spiegel, and 
>register not to be on the list. There are no graphics on the web page, its 
>just a form, so it won't take long to load.  All you need to leave is your 
>email address  (the rest, even your name is optional) and press submit.
>
>Before you get upset, think about it, you are already on some kind of list, 
>because I have your address. Registering at my web site will only take you 
>off the list. There is no advertising on the page, there is no money being 
>made by this.
>
>I will take your name off of this list and off any other list that  other 
>mailers submit. I will not give your name or address out to anyone else.
>
>I know that some people don't have browsers and only have mail access. If 
>you are among that group, please send email to me at  mobius@llv.com and be 
>sure to put your email address in the subject field and nothing in the body 
>of the letter.
>******************************************************************
> DO NOT REPLY AND SEND BACK THIS LETTER, IT WILL BE IGNORED BY MY SYSTEM !
>******************************************************************
>By the way, if you get junk mail, refer them to my web site as well and by 
>all means, tell your friends to register.
>
>Maybe this will help.
>
>Oh, and if you don't care about junk mail, you don't have to do a thing!

>Thank you
