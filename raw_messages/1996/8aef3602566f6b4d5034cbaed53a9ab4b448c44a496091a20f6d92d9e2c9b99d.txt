First of all, that (and the legitimacy of "wiretaps" in general) is 
something that should
be regulated in national law (including procedures, checks and balances, 
penalities). Maybe
you have the opinion that that is impossible to achieve, [or at least that 
making wiretapping
as such by government impossible is the only satisfactory way of doing it 
(-; ]. Our concept
assumes that it is possible and acceptable, although legislation (and 
especially appliance of
it) in some countries might be improved..

Second, the concept is flexible in the choice of Trusted Retrieval Parties; 
we have the opinion
that if you don't trust the existing TRPs then, hey, setup your own TRP. We 
believe that should be possible (and forsee serveral "privacy-protecting" 
organisations doing so). However, as you don't
want to have criminals setting up TRPs, some legislation on this point 
should be made...

Finally, as said in the announcement:
"In [VKT], we explain how we envision the framework in which the binding
concept could present a security tool in the information society."

Wait a minute. It is a *voluntary* system, but it has some rules that 
apply. The whole
idea here is: if you don't like it, use your own system. "Fraude" refers to 
using the
system without sticking to its rules, maybe fraude has a wrong connotation.

In a democratic country one needs evidence to convict someone.

They
should not get any wiser from it, that is the point.
