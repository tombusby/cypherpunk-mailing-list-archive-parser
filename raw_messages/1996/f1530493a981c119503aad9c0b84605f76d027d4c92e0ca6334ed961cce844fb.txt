The occasion was a "Cryptologic History Symposium," held on 
October 26, 1995, at NSA.
No time was given for rebroadcast.


Kahn spoke briefly on material covered in his book on 
codebreaking before and during WW2.


The second speaker was Professor Colin Burke, Univ. of 
Maryland, like Kahn a scholar-in-residence at NSA, who reviewed 
the pre-war and WW2 machines and proto-computers for 
cryptanalysis.


Kahn, a charming speaker, said about Russian cryptanalysis 
ability during WW2, that while there has been no published 
material on the period, three talents make for excellent 
cryptology: chess, music and mathematics, all of which the 
Russians excell at.

Other codebreaking news: the English are making a TV-movie on 
Alan Turing, due to be broadcast around Easter. It is based on 
the successful theater play a while back.
