Belize is a shit hole that is as willing as many other slimeball 
countries to deny someone entry and force them kicking and 
screaming onto the next flight to the U.S. on request from 
U.S. authorities. In principle, that is kidnaping. They use the 
technicality that the person never entered their territory. No- 
man's lands of port zones where the most basic rights may be 
violated without regard to a country's constitution are another 
class of abuse that will have to go.

Belize is also the place where Bob White, publisher of The Duck 
Book and sponsor of some of the largest hard-money conferences 
ever held, was murdered.  The usual suspects were not even 
rounded up.

Someone once wrote that the principle cash crop of Belize is lice. In reality it may be principles. At least the Hondurans 
got angry when a citizen was kidnaped by the U.S.
