"Truly noisy sources" are not at all unusual. Actually, the hard part is
ever proving a source is _not_ noisy. (There are deep issues involving
randomness here, and I usually go into the work of Kolmogorov, Chaitin, and
others at this point. Consult the archives, or see a book on information
theory.)

As Jim noted, any reasonably good crypto algorithm will produce an output
which so closely resmbles noise (modulo the issue of "Begin PGP" tags,
which can, and should, be removed) as to foil any efforts to prove it is
not noise.

The legal issue is this: can we pass laws and have them upheld by the
courts which impose severe penalties on people for the supposed crime of
having in their possession sequences of numbers which cannot be converted
to meaningful English sentences? I maintain that the Constitution says we
cannot. Of course, if the Constitution is thrown out, then the old
Cypherpunk joke may come into play: "Use a random number, go to jail." (An
Eric Hughes quote, from 1992-3.)

I think you are assuming a lot.
