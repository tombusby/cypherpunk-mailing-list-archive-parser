I am not talking about any "general case," I proposed compressing spinner
data, which has sequences of repeating numbers interspersed with occasional
quasi-random fluctuations.  I am not saying that compression is a "magic
wand" that will fix data streams with a lot of "fake" entropy, such as the
RND() function available in many BASIC's, which I think most of us will agree
blows chunks.

I have ZIPed the aforementioned spinner data with the built-in ZIP routines
in the PC Tools for Windows file manager.  Except for some very slight
banding (which appears to be caused by the ZIP headers) the noise sphere
plots look pretty good.  All files are available upon request for independent
verification.

I have no disagreements with this.  I merely proposed using the compression
function as a means of roughly estimating entropy and preventing the seeding
of the hash/PRNG with potentially "weak key" type data.

Would anyone like to propose a means of measuring entropy that we can all
agree on?  I haven't seen anything yet that everyone likes.
