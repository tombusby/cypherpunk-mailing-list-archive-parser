I just returned from the monthly CP meeting. This month's meeting was
hosted by PGP, Inc. thanks to the efforts of Dave del Torto, who is now
with PGP.

I would like to publicly thank Dave for making this meeting possible. It
was the best CP meeting in a long time. I very much enjoyed Eric Blossom's
demo of his voice encryption product. The sound quality is the best I ever
heard in such a product. And it uses 3DES. The encryption and sound quality
are much better than what you get from AT&T's STU-III.

But nothing could have prepared me for the generous gift that PGP, Inc.
made to each attendee: a four volume bound set of the *full* pre-alpha
source to PGP 3.0, totaling almost 2,000 pages!

Way to go, Dave.
