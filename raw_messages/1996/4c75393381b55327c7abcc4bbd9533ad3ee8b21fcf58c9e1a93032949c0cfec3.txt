And by having a public mailbox, you are in no position to say some entities
cannot mail to you.

While unwanted e-mail is bothersome, so are unwanted telephone calls,
unwanted faxes, unwanted regular mail, unwanted conversations at parties,
unwanted attention in general, and "unwanted unwanteds" in their most
general form.

But unless such unwanted things become frequent beyond some threshold (as
repeated phone calls may be, or as "fax-bombing" can be, or as "stalking"
situations occur, depending on various laws), the the law does not offer
convenient solutions. Nor should we want the already overcrowded courts and
jails clogged with "He sent me a message I didn't want!" whines.

The solution is screening calls with an answering machine or using
something like Caller ID to screen incoming calls, having an unlisted
number, turning off a fax machine except when expecting a fax, using Eudora
or procmail to filter messages. In other words, the equivalents of fences,
locks, doors, gates, and other barriers.
