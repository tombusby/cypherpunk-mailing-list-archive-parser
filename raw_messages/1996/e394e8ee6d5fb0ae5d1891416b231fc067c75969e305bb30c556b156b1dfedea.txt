...which would be a clear violation of the 5th amendment, and would (by 
informing the person targeted) defeat the entire purpose of getting the key 
in the first place.  Of course, you've also assumed that the escrowed data 
actually represents some sort of key, which it may not. (The data-holder is 
never told that the data he's asked to hold is REALLY a key!)  

 Insisting that the target of an investigation provide something that may 
not even exist is a sure way to fire up the populace.  Remember Madame 
Defarge (sp?)
