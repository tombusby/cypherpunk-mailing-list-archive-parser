"Put a round through the head of this discussion"?

One of the most common conceits on this list is summarized by this comment:
"I've said what I want to say, so now it's time for us to move on to other
things."

Or the charming equivalent: "You've heard my views, now can't we move on to
some _real_ cryptography?"

And then there's the old chestnut of claiming others have too much time on
their hands.
