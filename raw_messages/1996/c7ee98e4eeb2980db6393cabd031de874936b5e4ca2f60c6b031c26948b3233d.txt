>        EASYSAFE(R) VERSION 3.0 FOR DOS, WINDOWS & WINDOWS 95 'FIRST
>        NOTEBOOK SECURITY PRODUCT'
>        
>            CHICAGO, June 5 /PRNewswire/ - EliaShim Safe Software, a leading
>        provider of network security products and anti-virus protection
>        systems, announced at Spring Comdex 96 the release of EasySafe,
>        version 3.0, the first security and encryption product designed
>        specifically for notebook computers.
>        
>        .. EasySafe provides bullet-proof protection that is easy to install.
>        .. EasySafe prevents unauthorized use or access through boot password
>          protection.
>        .. EasySafe prevents removal or transfer of information via full hard
>          disk encryption.
>        .. EasySafe provides keyboard locking after three incorrect password
>          attempts.
>        .. EasySafe provides screen blanking after a predetermined period of
>          inactivity.
>        .. EasySafe denies system level access to hard disk information.
>        .. EasySafe can be configured to disable LPT, COM, and Floppy ports.
>        
>            Upon boot-up, EasySafe asks the user for a password.  A
>        correctly entered password grants the user access to the computer.
>        Encryption/decryption of data on the hard disk is dynamic and
>        completely transparent to the user.  The system allows for three
>        password attempts before locking the computer, and only a cold-boot
>        reset is possible. After entering the correct password, the disk is
>        unencrypted dynamically, normal boot up takes place, and the user is
>        granted access to the system without disk access restrictions or
>        delay.
>        
>            EasySafe includes a DOS/Windows screen saving utility which
>        blanks the screen after a period of inactivity.  The only way to re-
>        activate the computer is to enter the correct password.
>        
>            EasySafe offers two encryption methods.  The first encrypts all
>        data on local hard drives.  The second method encrypts boot sectors
>        and partitions.  This prevents unauthorized users from booting from
>        the "A": drive and accessing the data on the hard disk.  This
>        encryption scheme also protects against the use of disk editing
>        programs (such as Norton Utilities).  Thus, valuable company secrets
>        remain hidden and secure. EasySafe can be configured to disable LPT,
>        COM, and Floppy ports to ensure that the information contained on
>        the hard drive cannot be transferred to another system for later
>        viewing.
>        
>            While annual purchases of notebook computers have increased
>        steadily, the number of notebooks reported stolen each year is much
>        more alarming.  In 1995, 208,000 notebooks with a value of almost
>        $640 million were reported stolen by a Columbus, Ohio insurance
>        company that offers coverage for portable computers (Information
>        Week - May 6, 1996 issue).  EasySafe is the perfect product for
>        those field professionals whose notebooks contain valuable,
>        confidential, company information and other sensitive data that is
>        hundreds of times more valuable than the cost of a notebook.
>        
>            Founded in 1983, EliaShim Safe Software has been providing PC
>        security solutions and anti-virus protection for corporate,
>        government, educational institutions, and program developers in both
>        domestic and international markets.  Over four million computers are
>        protected worldwide.  Product line includes: EasySafe, MasterSafe,
>        ViruSafe Gold, and ViruSafe LAN.
