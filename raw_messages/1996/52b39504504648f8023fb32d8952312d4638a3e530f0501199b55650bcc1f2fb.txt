While this may end up looking like another of Jim Bell's odd 
interpretations, the only section in the US Constitution that I see as 
potentially REQUIRING a person's testimony is the section (can't recall 
which) which says that a defendant must have a process to compel the 
appearance of witnesses in his favor.  The Constitution, as far as I see, 
says nothing about requiring people to appear for the PROSECUTION.

I know that plenty of judges just automatically assume that this requirement 
is somehow in there, but a literal reading of the Constitution doesn't 
provide it.  If that's the case, the government has and should have no 
mechanism to force any key escrow agent to reveal a key.

I've always been astonished at the assumption that the government seems to 
be making that key escrow (which is fundamentally done for the benefit of 
the key holder) will be implemented in a way that could possibly help the 
cops out, in a way done to the detriment of the key holder.

But are subpoenas _really_ constitutional?  In any case, one of the effects 
of the widespread availability of good encryption might be that suddenly the 
documents that cops have historically thought were subpoena-able will no 
longer be.  That's life, although they won't like it.
