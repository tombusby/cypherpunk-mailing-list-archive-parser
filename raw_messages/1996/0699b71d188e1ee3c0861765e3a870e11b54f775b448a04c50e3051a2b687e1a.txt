I have been having some similar hastles setting up a site for credit card
usage.  It seems that the credit card companies are confused between
protecting cards over the net and validating credit card information.  (Two
entirly different problems.)  The broker we are going through seems to have
gotten a few clues, but it is taking ALOT of explaining.  (The site will be
running Stronghold when we are able to process credit cards. We are
currently running Apache 1.1.)  Actually I am having a harder time getting
through to the sysadmin at the host site why we need a commerce server than
I am with the credit card company...

It sounds like the scare stories on the news have taken their toll.
