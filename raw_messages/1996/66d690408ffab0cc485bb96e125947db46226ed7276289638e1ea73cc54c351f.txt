Well, if you look at the remailer part of the web page, it's just
one of many web pages that are a form interface to a remailer CGI program.
Basically a friendly way to use a standard 1-way Cypherpunks remailer.

The guts of the page (from View Source) are use replay's CGI
and the ecafe remailer:
        <form method="post" action="http://www.replay.com/cgi-bin/anon.exe"> 
        <input type="hidden" name="remailers" value="cpunk@remail.ecafe.org">
        <table border=2>           
        <tr><td align=right>           
        to: <input size=20 type=text name="to" value=""><br>           
        subject: <input size=20 type=text name="subject" value=""></td>

        <td align=center><input type="submit" value="send mail"></td></tr>

        <tr><td align=center colspan=2>           
        <textarea name="message" rows=12 cols=70 value="test">
        Put your message here.</textarea>           
        </td>           
        </tr>           
        </table>           
        </form>  

There is an amusing stealthed message at the bottom of the page,
designed to attract high relevancy ratings from spiders.....
