Yuck.

Unless someone comes forward to say that they were the target of this 
attack, I'd guess that the target is the remailer network itself.

This article is still on nntp.stanford.edu. I've issued a cancel. Sites far 
removed from stanford.edu should consider doing the same.

luzskru@cpcnet.com, of course, doesn't exist, *BUT* there is a 
luzskru.cpcnet.com in the DNS.

And while every other port seems to be closed, there is an open NNTP port.

N:~> telnet luzskru.cpcnet.com nntp
Trying 198.70.185.5...
Connected to luzskru.cpcnet.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
200 luzskru.cpcnet.com NNS server version X2.06 ready - posting allowed
quit
205 closing connection - goodbye
Connection closed by foreign host.

postmaster@cpcnet.com is probably a victim of this, but he should still be 
flayed with a wet noodle for letting this happen.
