Who said it had to be in one day? I didn't. Most vacations to Europe last a
couple of weeks, e.g., "If this is Tuesday, I need to make a withdrawal in
Milano."

I think a lot of ATMs will now dispense big chunks of cash--I've never
checked on limits, but I notice that some CRT screens now have chunks up to
$600 or so listed.

Thanks. Still not sure if it applies, but I'd forgotten that it's up to the
banks to do the reports; good to know it's not up to me.
