Anonymity and nonescrowed crypto are the linchpins of AP and its more 
general case, Maysian crypto anarchy. The withering of the nation-state. 
Whatever you want to call it.

To prevent it, governments will ban both. A criminal law, passed in the
wake of say a bombing this fall in Washington, DC, banning nonescrowed
crypto. (Freeh will assert he has evidence the terrorists used PGPhone.)
And another law banning online anonymity. 

What then, Mr. Bell?
