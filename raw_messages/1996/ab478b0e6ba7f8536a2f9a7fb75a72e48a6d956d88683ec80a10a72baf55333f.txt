There are businesses that _only_ list their 800 numbers, and you can't
find out the real phone number associated with them through directory
assistance.
It's especially annoying when they've got an in-state or other non-nation-wide
800 number, or when you're calling from outside the US, especially when
they're a business you'd like to be able to reach from anywhere, any time,
like the travel agent your office uses :-)  But it does make it hard to
call them directly for ANI-avoidance as well.  And they may _only_ have
the bank of phones that's got ANI service on it, and not have other phones.
