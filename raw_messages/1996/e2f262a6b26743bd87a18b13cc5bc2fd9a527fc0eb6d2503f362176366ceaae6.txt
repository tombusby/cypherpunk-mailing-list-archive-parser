   The message cannot be delivered because the
   recipient's mailbox contains the maximum number of 
   messages, as set by the system administrator.  The
   recipient must delete some messages before any
   other messages can be delivered.
    The maximum message limit for a user's mailbox is 
   10,000.  The default message limit is 1000 messages.  
   Administrators can set message limits using the 
   Mailbox  Settings function available in the 
   Manage User menu  (MUSER). 

   When a user's mailbox reaches the limit, the 
   user must delete some of the messages before 
   the mailbox can accept any more incoming messages.

I have every right as a citizen of country A to tell politicians of country B
what they should or shouldn't do.  This isn't about American Ideology; it's
about natural rights.  Politicians of country B can refuse to listen to me or
attempt to prevent my corrupt ideas from polluting the minds of its citizens,
but they won't succeed very well with the latter.  Of course, politicians may
be satisfied with making sure that only the most determined citizens will be
able to access information they don't want citizens to access, but as
technology progresses, it will become much more difficult to prevent this
information from spreading to the masses.

Cpunks is certainly not the best place to be discussing free speech.  However,
the link between free speech and the spread of cryptographic technology is too
close to completely overlook.
