Thanks to the anonymous poster of this WSJ article, "Obscure Treasury Unit
Helps DEA Uncover Scheme," I've added a name to the thread, which the
remailed post did not have.

FinCEN is a very intriguing agency, one which we've talked about several
times on this list. (I first vaguely heard of it in 1990 or '91, but there
was little press about it for a long time. An early issue of "Wired"
carried a comprehensive article on it, sometime late in '93.) FinCEN is a
multi-agency task force sort of thing, located in the Northern Virginia
complex of surveillance agencies, credit reporting agencies (hardly a
coincidence that TRW Credit, Transunion, and Equifax have major offices
within a few miles of FinCEN, the National Reconnaissance Organization,
CIA, etc.), etc.

If you want to know who's likely to be pushing for limits on encryption of
financial transactions, look no further than FinCEN.

EPIC, the El Paso Information Center, was orginally focussed on DEA types
of narco-surveillance, and developed several programs for sniffing the
aether for evidence that citizen-units were engaging in trade which the CIA
had granted itself a monopoly on.

Civil forfeiture is of course becoming a favored way of stealing assets
without actually having to go to court. In many cases, charges are dropped,
but the assets are not returned....the victim is forced to try to sue to
get the assets back. This is the modern version of governments and kings
issueing "letters of marque and reprisal," i.e., authorizing privateers to
act as "pirates," keeping a cut of what they grab. (Sir Francis Drake being
an historical example.)

Indeed, this is likely. As with the guy who blew away his stock broker in
1987 in Florida...turned out he had been set up with a phony I.D. and
falsified credit history (courtesy of Equifax, Transunion, TRW complicity,
one has to presume) and given a million dollars of spending money. This is
the "Witness Security Program," run by the U.S. Marshall's Service.

Can a person sue WitSec, or TRW Credit, etc., for falsifying such records?

(The credit reporting agencies immediately can spot the "ghosts" who
suddenly pop into existence, as when WitSec clients and spies are given
cover identities...this is a reason for the cozy relationship and the
"classified" status of many credit agency projects. Think about it.)

Someday the records of those 60,000 folks in the WitSec program will be
"liberated" and placed anonymously on the Net for the perusal of their
neighbors, their former Mafia families, and so on. I can't wait. Of course,
about 15,000 of them will likely be killed in short order. I also can't
wait for that.

FinCen, WitSec, etc. are examples of fundamentally criminal agencies, and
the bigwigs in each probably have already earned severe punishment when
their misdeeds become more fully apparent. I don't advocate blowing up
their buildings, a la OKC, but I certainly understand the sentiment.
