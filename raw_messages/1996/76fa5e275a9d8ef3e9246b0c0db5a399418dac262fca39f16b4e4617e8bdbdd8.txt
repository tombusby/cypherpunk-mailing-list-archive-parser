Hi all,

A question for the matematicians out there:

I am looking at the Diffie Hellman public key exchange protocol and 
am trying to find out why it is computationally hard to take logs in 
a finite (Galois) field.

My maths tutor has told me a bit about the construction of Galois 
fields (If I`m correct the construction is Z mod N, N some integer, 
then a transformation F(x) on the residue classes already in the 
field) I know also the definition is that there are P**k elements, p 
a prime.

My questions are as follows:

1. How can a field be finite, as by definition it has to be closed 
under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division???? (sorry 
if this one is a bit of a no brainer, maybe the definition is 
different but I can`t seem to see how)

2. Why is taking logs in a finite field computationally hard? - Me 
and Alec (My maths tutor at college) guessed that it is because 
exponentiation and logs are each others inverse functions, and 
somehow this becomes a one way function in a finite field.

3. Are the Galois fields used in Diffie Hellman specially constructed 
in any way or are they just normal GF????

Thanks for any help anyone can give me....
