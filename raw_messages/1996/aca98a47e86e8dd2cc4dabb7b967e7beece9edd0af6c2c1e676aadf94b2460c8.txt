How are you going to tell *what* I was talking about?  I guaruntee with
any message of practical length (i.e. not " ckosuuy") will have multiple
possibilities, particularly when you take things like mispellings,
software artifacts ("----- BEGIN PGP --------" "X-Received ..." etc.) and
deliberate attempts to throw you off.  That's why it's unbreakable - by
anyone!
