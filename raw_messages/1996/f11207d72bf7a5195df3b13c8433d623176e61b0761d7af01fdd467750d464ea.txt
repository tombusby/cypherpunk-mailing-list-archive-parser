I learned how to shoot very young.  My father taught me, as well as
enrolling me in NRA competitions around age 14.  They still have high school
rifle teams where I used to live as well.  But then the culture is quite
different towards guns in Alaska than it is here...  (For one, people do not
view them as toys and/or possessed by evil spirits or the like...)

I bet the "National Curfew" crap that Clinton is trying to push is not going
down well either.  He seems to think that the problems of a small fraction
of the country apply to the whole country...  (But it makes for good sound
bites.)
