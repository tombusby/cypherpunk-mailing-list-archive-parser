The only way I can think of is if the text that the user supplies is not 13
characters long and contains characters not used in crypt(3) base64 encoding,
then the text is definitely not a hashed password.  This would catch nearly
all cleartext passwords, although there is a little room for error.  FYI, the
characters used for base64 encoding are [0-9],[A-Z],[a-z],'/', and '.'.
