if I'm not mistaken, large companies are able to purchase (in a way) 
government support. Special interest groups and large lobbying groups are 
also able to sway the government with either money , votes or things more 
insidious. You are absolutely right, big companies do get bigger because 
of (partly) government support of some form, but that's because they can 
afford to pay for it.
