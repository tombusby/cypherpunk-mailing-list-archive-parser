I can state that with a Zip Disk formatted for Macintosh use (and the drive
plugged into a Macintosh), the drive and disk are seen by the Macintosh as
a NORMAL SCSI HD and eligible for use as a Boot Drive (ie: There is a Mac
Driver on the Disk in a SCSI Driver Partition). I've Booted from a ZIP Disk
so this is actual not just theoretical <g>. I'd assume that if a Wintel
Machine had the Microcode to be able to boot off an external SCSI Drive
(something I do not know is normal for Wintel machines as it is normal for
Macintosh ones) the same situation would exist for Wintel Zip Formatted
Disks. All NORMAL SCSI HDs (or Cartridges) have their driver in a Driver
Partition so the HD/Cartridge can be read.
