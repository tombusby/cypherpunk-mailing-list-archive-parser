Jim Bell's ignorance apparently knows no boundaries.  That's not what 
"sandbagging" means.

In poker, to sandbag is to raise a bet after having opened that betting
round by checking.  It's frowned upon in some poker games, but completely
acceptable in others - check the house rules before trying it.

Try as I might, I can't see how Black Unicorn's statements qualify as
sandbagging.  He certainly didn't open the betting by checking!
