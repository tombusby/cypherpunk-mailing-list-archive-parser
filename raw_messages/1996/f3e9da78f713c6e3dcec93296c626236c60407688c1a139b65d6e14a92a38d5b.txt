why not put together (a LOT of) disk space and we can build a table
(read: "a cryptanalytic time-memory tradeoff") for cracking DES? Using
the table, we could brute-search the DES keyspace in less time than it
would take to do an exhaustive search of a 38 bit keyspace, according to
the paper. 4 gigs is what, a couple of hundred nowadays?

Making DES equivalent to a 40-bit crack would take approx. 500Gig, but
publishing the table would push DES out usefulness. Certainly we could
scale back (make DES equivalent to a 45-bit crack?) if we don't have
enough disk...
