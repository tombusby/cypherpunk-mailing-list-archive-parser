There are _many_ "soft targets," of course. Millions, in fact. But some are
"more likely" than others to be hit, a la Schelling points.

Schelling points need not involve "coordination" between actors, though
Schelling points provide one means of coordination without communication
(e.g., where does each think a meeting will occur).

Schelling points are like "The Match Game" (an old t.v. show largely
written by one of the main contributors to "Mad Magazine").  Namely, "Name
a place likely to be attacked by terrorists."

Coordination is not the issue. Rather, the Olympics was (obviously) a
likely target, for a variety of reasons.
