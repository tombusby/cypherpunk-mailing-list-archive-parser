Defense is cheaper than attack in encryption because it is easier to make
coherent information incoherent (see Usenet) than it is to make incoherent
information coherent.

But since the Internet and the WANs and LANs that you are talking about are
all "private value-added networks," the benefits of enhanced security a
fully captured by the users of those networks and there is no "public goods"
problems.  (BTW, there were private lighthouses too.)  

Note too that major money center banks disagree with you.  There was a
recent article about the fact that they are not reporting computer
intrusions and just fixing the problems themselves.  They don't seem
interested in official security "help" with all the disadvantages (publicity
and security leaks) that it brings.
