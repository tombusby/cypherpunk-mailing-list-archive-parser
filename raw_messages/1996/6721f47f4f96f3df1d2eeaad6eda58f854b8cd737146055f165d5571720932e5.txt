I beleive the distilled wisdom on entropy availability is summed up by Wei

I don't think there is a way to get "normal" keyboard/mouse data.  A
"scribble" window is certainly a possibility.  However, see my comments
below.

Note that what Ted is using and Bill Sommerfeld is commenting on is
basically a spinner.  In looking over the detailed data (which I have not
copied), it appears to me that even adding the 3rd order deltas may leave
the actual entropy overestimated.  The source of entropy is basically the
system scheduler.  It is a deterministic process, which depends slightly on
the somewhat less deterministic processes of I/O interrupts etc.  I feel
uncomfortable estimating 1 bit/second from it, and prefer to accept Wai
Dai's zero bits/second.

One severe problem we seem to have is that all automatic entropy estimation
techniques tend to over-estimate the amount of entropy present.

Perhaps when the millennium comes, we will have hardware generation and be
able to sleep at night.
