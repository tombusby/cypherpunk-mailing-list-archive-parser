I just got done watching it. Heavy on the porno and Light on the privacy.
It did cover some of our hot buttons but stayed away from talking about
their context (ie: They covered the TN prosecution of the CA BBS owner but
ignored the question of if it was a prosecution or a persecution [as well
as the question of if the charge/trial was legal in the first case]).
