So Bert, let's just call a spade a spade, eh?  Since you readily agree 
that organized criminals probably won't use binding crypto, and that 
TRP's will probably leak our info to spy "agencies" and so on, then that 
would make your system yet another of those programs that can't monitor 
organized crime directly, but instead harasses non-criminal citizens in 
the hope that the agencies can eventually get to the criminals via an 
indirect connection, i.e., the citizen happens to buy something at a web 
site run by Crime, Inc. (assuming that Crime, Inc. is not in fact just 
another agency-run sting operation).

As far as fraud is concerned, my main concern is that important (or any) 
documents etc. are not forged, including my personal communications.  
This is particularly important to prevent frame-ups, which run rampant 
in the U.S.  I suppose they don't frame people in your country.  Well, 
it's public knowledge that the Justice Dept. does this sort of thing 
here, so knowing that, are you still suggesting we trust them, simply 
because you trust your government?  Or are you suggesting that with all 
of this new technology, that the U.S. Justice Dept. will evolve into a 
more ethical agency like your govt. allegedly has, instead of the other 
way around?
