The birthday paradox doesn't apply in my case I believe. Its not an
all-to-all comparison. One file is "given" by the user. I'm definately
not a crypto-expert, however, so I could be wrong.

I'd like to know more about this.

You'd have to read the tech report on rsync. It does not download the
whole file when a checksum mismatch is found, that would be next to
useless. 

It effectively creates binary diffs of the two files, without direct
(local) access to both files. As far as I know this is a new type of
algorithm.

In practice the hashes and checksums dominate the data that is sent
over the link. They total about 1/30 of the total file size for the
default settings.

Do you have references to the md4 collision stuff? The situation I
have is a bit unusual so its just possible some of the results may
apply.

It already uses a 16 bit hash as a first level filter and a 32 bit
"rolling checksum" as the 2nd level. The 2nd level fails about 25
times on a 25MB test file I've been using. The failure rate goes as
the square of the file length. When the 2nd level fails it is detected
by the md4 hash which has to be much stronger.

Cheers, Andrew
