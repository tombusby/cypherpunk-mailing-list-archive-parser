Aristotle.org is run by John Aristotle Phillips.  If you remember
back in the 70s when a student at Princeton designed an atomic bomb
as his junior physics project, that was him (he wasn't brilliant;
he just needed a really good paper to bring up his low physics grades.)
He's since gone into political consulting.

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
  and the politicians had to count them all.
