The advert was probably for a device/program called PICBUSTER. This is
basically a technique of popping the PIC16C84 microcontroller. The chip is
an EEPROM micro. There are a few ways of popping the chip but the simplest
is to ensure that there is set the supply voltage to the programming voltage
less about 0.7 Volts. This is generally done with the aid of a diode such as
the 1N4148. Then the fuses are reset. For normal programming there should be
at least 5 Volts differential. The smaller differential seems to only allow
the protection to be popped. It is not a fusible link as such.

Apparently the protection fuse in the EPROM versions of the microcontrollers
are fairly readily identifiable. Most of the OTP microcontrollers are
essentially EPROM types without the quartz glass window. 

The commonest procedure for popping these is to first remove the coating and
then to measure accurately where the protection fuse is. Then, with another
that is to be popped, a small hole is drilled over the fuse area. The
drilling operation stops before reaching the silicon die. Then some strong
acid, either Sulphuric or Nitric is dropped in to disolve the coating. Then
a UV lamp is shone on the fuse to reset it.

The latter techique for popping chips is by far the most dangerous. It
requires proper acid handling procedures and good ventilation. 

Another technique is to fool the microncontroller into switching from
internal to external EPROM and then back. This hack generally works on the
8051, 8751, 8052 and 8752 microcontrollers.

I was coincidentally just finishing a section on popping chips for a book
that I am working on :-)
