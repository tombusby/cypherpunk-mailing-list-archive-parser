This was discussed a bit here on the list when Netscape first did it, which
was in either v2.01 or v2.02.  At the time, I thought about writing a patch
to fix the problem, but decided there was really little purpose in trying
to talk http to sendmail, so I didn't bother.

In any event, the blocking is in netscape itself and not in the proxy
server, so you could just telnet to your proxy on port 80, and issue the
commands to connect to whereever you want.

You could also look for a program called webex, it's a cgi script which
generates html forms on the fly, allowing you to read your mail in your
web browser.

I feel I should point out that accessing your mail in an unencrypted
fashion, through a possibly untrusted proxy server is quite insecure and 
not generally advisable.
