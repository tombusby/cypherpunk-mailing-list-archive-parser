                 The Digital Commerce Society of Boston
            (Formerly The Boston Society for Digital Commerce)

                               Presents

                             Fred Hapgood

                   Digital Commerce: Living Room ExIm,
                 Retail Replacement, or Mail-Order Redux?


                        Tuesday, February 6, 1995
                               12 - 2 PM
                   The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
                     One Federal Street, Boston, MA


Fred says:

>So far Web commerce has largely been a speciality export story.
>(www.activmedia.com says that web commerce is half exports.) This
>reflects the obvious strengths of the medium: webstores are
>globally accessible and can support information resources to any
>depth customers require.
>
>However, the meat and potatoes of the $2 trillion American retail
>market lie not in specialty exports but in geographically
>structured markets built on access to local traffic and
>characterized by low-information transactions.  If web commerce
>has no role to play in commerce on this level, it will end up
>little more than an extension and enhancement of direct mail.
>(Which is of course not to be dismissed entirely: direct mail did
>$55 billion last year.)
>
>My talk will address the compatibility of these segments with the
>web, now and later.


Fred Hapgood has written on internet commerce for _CIO_ and
_Webmaster_ magazines.  He has written on associated subjects for
_Wired_ and _Inc-Technology_.  The February talk will be based on
research for an article on the web and franchising.



This meeting of the Boston Society for Digital Commerce will be held on
Tuesday, February 6, 1995 from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of the
Harvard Club of Boston, One Federal Street. The price for lunch is $27.50.
This price includes lunch, room rental, and the speaker's lunch. ;-).  The
Harvard Club *does* have a jacket and tie dress code.

We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or if we *really* know
you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by
Saturday, February 2 , or you won't be on the list for lunch.  Checks
payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will have to be sent
back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The Harvard
Club of Boston".

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've had
to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for instance), please
let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something out.

Planned speakers for the following few months are:

 February    Fred Hapgood     Freelance Author
 March       Glenda Barnes    X.9 Electronic Commerce Security Group
 April       Donald Eastlake  CyberCash
 May         Perry Metzger    Security Consultant and Cypherpunk
 June        Dan Shutzer      FSTC
 July        Pete Loshin      Author, "Electronic Commerce"

We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on the
first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a presentation to the
Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program Commmittee, care of Robert
Hettinga, rah@shipwright.com .
