The latest GAK proposal is not under discussion.  What is under discussion
is the policy options that are possible when there is strong public
support to suppress strong cryptography.  The Four Horsemen scenario
would likely generate such mass support, even among cypherpunks.

I am not convinced, but I am not expert in this area.

Yes, I am assuming that the Four Horsemen scenario would stimulate strong
public support for extraordinarily tough restrictions on crypto.

Yes, I doubt it would ever get to this point because cryptoanarchy will
be far less dramatic than many people believe.  It may cause dramatic
changes, but they will be subtle and gradual, like the Net's influence.

For instance, I don't think Ruby Ridge would ever have been an issue
raised in Congress if it hadn't been for the Internet.  This is a subtle
and positive change, but most people hardly noticed the effect of the Net.

The way in which the agenda is set has moved out of New York and Washington.
Strong cryptography promotes this because it enables people to discuss
issues which are important to them without fear of retribution.

I don't think that there will be a strong revolt against crypto.  From the
point of view of the GAKers that's a problem.  That is why they have to
act before the public discovers it's an asset, not a liability.

But, if the GAKers are right about the Four Horsemen scenario (which
I doubt they believe themselves) there would be great public support
for drastic measures and these measures could be quite effective.
