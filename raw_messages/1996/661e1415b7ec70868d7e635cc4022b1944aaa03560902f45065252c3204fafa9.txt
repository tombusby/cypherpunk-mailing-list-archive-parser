The Cypherpunks gang has apparently attacked a San Francisco artist's
www site, harrassing him and mail-bombing his service provider in an
attempt to get him to drop the account. The Cpunks objected to an applett
that this artist had on one of his pages that would send a mail greeting
to people who had a *mail-to:* button on their www pages. This greeting
consisted of his URL only and went through an anon remailer.
