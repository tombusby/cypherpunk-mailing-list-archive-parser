If you run /usr/etc/devinfo -vp (Sun OS 4.1.x), or /usr/sbin/prtconf -vp
(Solaris 2.x) you'll get a line which looks like

clock-frequency:  02625a00

This is the clock frequency in hexadecimal in Hz.

The above example is from an IPX (40 MHz).

Another example. On an SS1000E with two 60 MHz processors, you'll
get output indicating two CPU devices each starting with

        Node 0xffd8e6ac
            clock-frequency:  03938700
            device_type:  'cpu'

again 0x03938700 == 60000000 

On an Ultra 170E one gets
    Node 0xf006ea64
        manufacturer#:  00000017
        implementation#:  00000010
        mask#:  00000022
        sparc-version:  00000009
        ecache-associativity:  00000001
        ecache-line-size:  00000040
        ecache-size:  00080000
        #dtlb-entries:  00000040
        dcache-associativity:  00000001
        dcache-line-size:  00000020
        dcache-size:  00004000
        #itlb-entries:  00000040
        icache-associativity:  00000002
        icache-line-size:  00000020
        icache-size:  00004000
        upa-portid:  00000000
        clock-frequency:  09f437c0
        reg:  000001c0.00000000.00000000.00000008
        device_type:  'cpu'
        name:  'SUNW,UltraSPARC'


and 0x09f437c0 == 167000000

Watch out for other lines labelled, clock-frequency, these are for 
other devices. You want the one for the CPU device(s) (i.e. node with 
device type 'cpu').
