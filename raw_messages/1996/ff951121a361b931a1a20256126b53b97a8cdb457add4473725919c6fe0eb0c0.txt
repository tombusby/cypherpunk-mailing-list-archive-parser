This is the first step towards repudiation of real electronic cash.  
I am not in favor of "forcing" companies to act (BTW, they are not 
forced to do anything, they can choose not to accept Visa), but if 
Visa will go to bat to support their debit cards, they may be willing 
to support ecash the same way.
