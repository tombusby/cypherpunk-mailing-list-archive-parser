 So I pulled up the Web site to see what sort of reward they
 offered to the successful cracker.  Under the heading 
 "Attention `Hackers'" they said if you crack their 
 unbreakable SafE Mail code, you get 5 free copies of ...
 SafE Mail!  Oh, that's a really primo prize, broken 
 software.  Duh.
 
 Since cracking their encryption is IMPOSSIBLE, I suggest 
 they make the stakes interesting--$100,000, or hell, a cool
 million.  After all, it's unbreakable.  It's not like they
 will have to pay up or anything.

Very good point. Hell I have a book that offers $1,000 to crack a little
string.
How much does everyone here actually talk about the techniques of
decryption?? Is is something any of you are well versed at and would welcome
any questions to?
Thanks.....
