The debate over Internet regulation in the UK has focused mainly on 
censorship, but the standards for control of "encryption keys", currently
being formulated nationally and internationally, will lay the permanent
foundations on which the Information Society is built. The long-term 
implications for civil liberties have received little public attention 
outside the Internet community.

Scientists for Labour is hosting a conference to look at the data protection 
and economic issues arising from the integration of digital signatures, 
electronic copyright management, and digital cash. What kind of regulatory 
apparatus will allow rapid growth of an information economy, but prevent 
misuse of personal data ? 

*) New government proposals on "Trusted Third Parties", which aim to preserve
   law enforcement and national security capabilities for warranted 
   interception of communications (to fight crime and terrorism), place only 
   procedural not technical limits on the scope of Superhighway surveillance. 

*) Super-computers have the potential to conduct random electronic "fishing 
   expeditions" against the whole population. Telephone and letter 
   interception cannot be automated : digital monitoring can. 

Will legal safeguards against abuse offer adequate protection in perpetuity, 
or can cryptographic protocols be designed which make Superhighway mass-
surveillance impossible, while still allowing criminals to be targeted ? 

Computer and legal policy experts will explain the principles of the 
different technologies, and the international and commercial context, in a 
search for interdisciplinary solutions. 

The attendance fee is ?5 (?2 unwaged ; SfL members free)
