I asked my wife about this (she is a midaeval history buff) and her response
was "depends on the time and king".

She proceeded to list off the long list of taxes that vassels could be
expected to pay.  The current taxes in California do not come close to the
arbitrary and intrusive taxes imposed in feudal times.  Taxes could be
levied at any time the lord demanded. (Check into the custom of "Tallage".)
Of course this did not include the tithes to the church (which were
manditory) or any of the special taxes for wars, ransoms, and the like...

I suggest reading what life in that time was really like.  It makes
California seem like a Libretarians paradise in comparison.  (For example,
unmarried villein women were taxed due to the assumption that their being
unchaste lessened their value to the lord.  Sounds like something Pat
Buchannon would like to bring back...)
