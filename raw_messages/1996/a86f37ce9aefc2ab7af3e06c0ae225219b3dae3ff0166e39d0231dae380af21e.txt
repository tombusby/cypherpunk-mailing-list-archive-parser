It seems to me that by the logic--and possibly the direct language--of the
Communications Decency Act, parents who "expose" the children of others to
higher levels of V-Chip ratings than they get at home would themselves be
liable.

Plus, how long will it be before Children's Protective Services interviews
children at their schools to determine if parents have set their V-Chip
levels too high?

Will divorcing parents demand specific V-Chip settings when the kids are at
the ex-spouse's place? Or use the V-Chip settings in custody battles? ("My
ex-husband has a setting of 2-3-2, according to my son, and I find this
completely unacceptable.")

Maybe we'll see "V-Chip Settings Escrow."  "Under this system, V-Chip
settings must be voluntarily escrowed with Child Protective Services.
Should an incident of abuse be alleged, the escrowed V-Chip settings can be
examined by social service workers for evidence of deviant viewing
behaviors."
