You know, shalmaneser@alpha.c2.org sent me a message demanding that he be
given the name shalmaser@black.net on my system, for exactly this reason.

I told him to fuck off.

Now he's threatening to sue me. Do you folks think this is right?

(More to the point, this example shows that whatever "anonymous" thinks
about "claims" on nyms, it's pointless. Even if _some_ nyms are apparently
persistent across nymservers, all it takes is the possibility of this not
to be so for the fiction to collapse. The best way to prove that
"shalmaneser@alpha.c2.org" is really the same True Name (or in alliance
with) as "foobar@black.net" is to show that either can read the messages
encrypted to the other.)
