Seth Godin, Presenting Digital Cash (1995) reports on p. 94:

Mondex "spent four years developing state-of-the-art protection against 
reverse engineering by finding the world's best reverse engineers and 
give them [sic] a shot a cracking the chip in their smart cards."

==details anyone?

Elsewhere, in the interview in the Appendix, Tim Jones admits they are 
currently vulnerable to a MITM attack, but promises a fix real soon.

<>
In other Mondex news, the American Banker newspaper reports they are going
to field test a card in a British university; it will do meals, copies,
etc... 

Any other Mondex news around?
