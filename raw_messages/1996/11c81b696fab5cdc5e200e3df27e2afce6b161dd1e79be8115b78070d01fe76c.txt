As I mentioned a couple of days ago, science fiction writer David Brin
has an argument against not only anonymity, but _privacy_ as well.
Where cypherpunks tend to think of privacy as both beneficial and
inevitable, Brin sees it as harmful and doomed.  He has an article in
the December 1996 issue of Wired discussing his ideas.

BTW cypherpunk Doug Barnes is also quoted several times in the long
article in that issue by Neal Stephenson (Snow Crash, The Diamond Age)
about the undersea cables that carry most transnational information
traffic.
