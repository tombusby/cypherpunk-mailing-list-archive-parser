I went to that page.

It's lousy and useless. If you follow the adresses in the source, you end 
up at "Aristocratic Advertising Administration", which belongs to this guy:

floeter@sendit.nodak.edu  and
floeter@www.hillsboro.k12.nd.us
http://134.129.18.248/~floeter/

and he as a collegue at

bladow@sendit.nodak.edu and
HREF="http://134.129.18.248/~bladow/inex.htm

I guess those two just want to be cool (what a pity).
