NEWS

The sponsors of the Pro-CODE bill (S.1726) will hold the second of
two hearings on the encryption issue in Washington D.C. this coming
Wednesday, June 26.  Witnesses scheduled to testify at the hearing, which
will focus on the Burns/Leahy Pro-CODE bill (S. 1726) include:

* Phil Zimmermann, Inventor of PGP
* Whit Diffie, Father of Public-Key Cryptography
* Jerry Berman, Executive Director, Center for Democracy and Technology
* Matt Blaze, Cryptographer
* Phil Karn, Cryptographer
* Barbara Simons, Chair of US Public Policy Committee, ACM
* Marc Rotenberg, Director, Electronic Privacy Information Center
* AND YOU!! (See below for details)

The hearing will focus on the need to reform US encryption policies,
proposals to relax export controls on encryption, and the privacy issues
raised by the current policy.

Senator Burns (R-MT), Senator Leahy (D-VT) and the other sponsors of the
Pro-CODE bill want to hear from the Net.community about why encryption is
important to privacy and security on the Internet.

If you're like most of American, you cannot take a day off just to attend
the hearings to make your voice heard.  Luckily, you can use the
handy World Wide Web form to express your opinion and have it entered
into the record.

Please be sure to visit http://www.crypto.com/ and add your voice to the
debate over encryption policy on Capitol Hill.  Responses will be tabulated
and the results, along with selected statements, will be included in the
Congressional Record by Senator Conrad Burns.  The results will also be
featured during the Security and Freedom through Encryption Forum (SAFE) on
July 1 (details on that event are attached below).  If you find the WWW
form too constraining, or you do not have access to the World Wide Web,
send your testimony to Shabbir J. Safdar (shabbir@panix.com) who will
make sure it gets into the record.
