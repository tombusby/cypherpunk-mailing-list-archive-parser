As far as it goes, and considering that it's from an industry group, this 
sounds like an excellent response to this Burns bill proposal.  (Not "Bill," 
because it's still not available, apparently.)  This response is probably as 
close as we can expect to a repudiation of the Leahy bill.  It still isn't 
clear, though, whether the Burns bill is intended to be just an elimination 
of export controls on encryption, or whether it will contain other provisions.

My question, which still hasn't been answered, is:  "Does this bill exist 
yet?"  The answer is really not inconsequential, because if it _isn't_ at 
least sketched out yet, then that either should give us the opportunity to 
add provisions we want, or alert us that there is still the risk from 
Denning-types of including provisions we don't want.  Either way, action is 
called for, if only action to keep somebody else from taking action.  

I don't have any objection to a bill which merely eliminates export 
requirements on encryption; that would be a substantial step in the proper 
direction.  If that's the best we can do for this session of Congress, I 
hope we can achieve this as a stepping-stone.
