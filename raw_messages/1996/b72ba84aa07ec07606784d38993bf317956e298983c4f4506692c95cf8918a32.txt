Declan answers in the affirmative that, yes, nearly all of the examples I
cited are indeed crimes.

As I well knew, which is why I presented them. (The Jock Sturges case was
in SF, the "little girls in leotards" case was only a few years ago, etc.)

My point really was not to ask if the examples are illegal but to point out
the "thoughtcrime" nature of making it a felony to draw pictures of naked
children, when clearly no actual child was ever involved, when no actual
person could have been the victim of an actual crime.
