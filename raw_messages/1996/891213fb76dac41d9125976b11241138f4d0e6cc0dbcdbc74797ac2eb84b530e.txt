Am I the only person who finds this comment, in context, howlingly funny?

And I know of other people who's ideas were changed by such
discussions. A couple of them subscribe to this list.

In any case, Tim, this *is* now the sewer list, the place where
anything at all may be flushed by the inhabitants, partially as a result
of your own lobbying against "Perrygrams" and such. I understand that
many do not like the taste of their own drek, but hey, its what you
asked for. Repeatedly, you stood your ground and staked your claim and
said "no one will tell ME what to do", and well, you got what you
wanted.
