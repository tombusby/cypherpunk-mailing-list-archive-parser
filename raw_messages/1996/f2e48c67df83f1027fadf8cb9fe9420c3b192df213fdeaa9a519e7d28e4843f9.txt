I know. Just look at your posting a private message to a newsgroup because of
something thats just beyond your use. So... you can't handle it and become
like a baby.. and start something so utterly pointless as this.. by writing
me back to begin with. You dont like the program..or think its so trivial
(which it is... big fuc*in deal )
then thats fine. EVERYONE has their opinion. Some people find a use out of
it...obviously you dont. Its Ok man. Just take some prozac (or is the topic
ritalin now??)  and youll be A OK
