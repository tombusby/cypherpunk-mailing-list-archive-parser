Mmmmmhhh.  Although the state of affairs you point out in the above paragraph
unfortunately exist, your first paragraph denotes your vision of the world...

In today's economy, with a monetary system not backed by a physical standard,
it is true, in a sense.  Unfortunately.

So, what other dilemna do you have to oppose to my false one?

It is a contradiction in term.

The fact that they might have rationalized thugish behaviour 400years ago 
is not relevant to the discussion.  Would you rape the next village's girls?
After all, it was certainly current practice 400 years ago, *somewhere* ...

I won't comment on this one, since I do not accept that my morality be held hostage
by the actions of others.  I do not mean to absolve Corp. Inc that just tries to make
money through speculation rather than production.  But the argument does not even 
desserve an answer.  I am not a psycho-epistemologist...


>>You can not have your cake and eat it too...
>Huh? What does that have to do with this argument?

You cannot makes rules that protect a basic principle and at the same time have 
exceptions based on whims.  Because the latter will destroy the first.
