Do we know for sure that they've got decent encryption?

Aircraft aren't the only market for GPS.

There's a fad to put GPS in cars - it's already very common in Japan, and
Americans are catching up. They're used in conjunction with computerized
road maps. Here improving the accuracy of one's position on the map might
make for a very successful commercial product.
