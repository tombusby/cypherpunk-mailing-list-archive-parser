This claim was made at a symposium held at Harvard by a sometime lecturer
at the National Defense college.  He later denied it.  Since lots of other
things he said in the same lecture were plainly false (more likely his
ignorance than a clever attempt to spread FUD), I wouldn't lose sleep over
it.

Anyway, who cares -- you just use encryption and chaining and all is well.
