Remember Sturgen's (sp?) law: 90% of everything is crap -  I think most of
us just take awhile before we agree.  The SF genre could be characterized by
a couple diamonds buried in a manure pit...

I'd agree 100%.  A community as small as the SF writers *needs* outside
influence.  Must be neat, though, to read a book and go "I *did* that!"

nanotech (and other things) can spoil a good story by making things too
easy.  Take most (all?) of Forward's books - great ideas, but it reads like
a press release.

I think those books are partly responsible for getting a great many people
interested in this sort of thing...

Always a mark of a great SF author: his stuff is still good even if the
science is outdated...   Ditto EE smith - it's funny, when you read things
like the lensmen series it seems cliched until you realize it *is* cliched -
because so many others copied him.
