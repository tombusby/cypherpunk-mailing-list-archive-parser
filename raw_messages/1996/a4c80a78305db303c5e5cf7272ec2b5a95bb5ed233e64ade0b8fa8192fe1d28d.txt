Oh, my! A little sensitive, are we? Aren't you even a *little*
struck by the fact that fucking with people's personal lives 
is *precisely* what errant government officials *do*???

Some might opine that the reason we have so many abuses is that
so *few* people use the power they hold in their hands to set 
things right. Even the well-intentioned seem to expect someone 
*else* to do their maintenance of the republic for them.

That's part of The Game, Rich.  It makes it all that much easier 
for people to dismiss attempts at delineation by saying things 
like, oh, "The line between government and non-government is 
increasingly blurry anyway."

Oh. Okay, then. That makes it OK for them to indict you to keep 
their statistics up. Works for me!

I'm not. Maybe *you* should be more suspicious of the guy getting
paid $100K of direct government money to manage a national 
campaign of low-key terror than you should of the private 
businessman unable to pay himself because he *must* pay his 
employees and the government doesn't leave him enough for his 
own paycheck. This last is a *lot* more common than the "private 
businessman getting millions of dollars in government subsidies."

"Looking for pow'r... in all the wrong places, (la-tee-dah)..."
Admit it, Rich, you only see harmful power where you want to see 
it, and that isn't in government -- it is in private hands, 
particularly *corporate* hands. Geez, but you'd think that 
left-handed university cookie cutter would have gotten dulled and 
broken by now, and that they'd have fashioned a new one.

I'd estimate that the Postmaster General is more powerful than 
Fidel Castro in many respects. He's certainly a lot more powerful 
than your average private businessman.

That's quite all right. We can be sure he won't ignore *you*.
