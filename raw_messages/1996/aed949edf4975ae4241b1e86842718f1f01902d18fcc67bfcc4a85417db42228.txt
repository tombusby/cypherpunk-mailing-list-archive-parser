>P.S.  Do police really need a search warrant to wiretap cellular phones?

It is my understanding that police need a warrant to tap *cellular* 
phones, but not *wireless* phones.

One should understand that monitoring cellular traffic is *much* more 
difficult than tapping a conventional phone, because as the user 
moves around in the service area the phone switches to different 
repeaters, often several times during a conversation.

I am curious as to the language of the proposed law, as it is also my 
understanding that the government already has the (technical) means to monitor 
cellular traffic (but it requires a warrant, just like tapping a 
regular phone).
