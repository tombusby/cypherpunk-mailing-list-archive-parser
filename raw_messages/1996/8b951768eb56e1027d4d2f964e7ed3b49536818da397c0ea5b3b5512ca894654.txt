I am sorry, but the term "crackerbox" has been deemed derogatory to Southern
Americans by the Society for the Protection of American Minorities (SPAM).

You will have to apply for another neologism from the Bureau of Neologisms.
This time I suggest that you remember to fill out the proper paperwork so
that these problems will not occur in the future.  (To speed your
application, please include doubling the filing fee, the first half as a
check made out to the Bureau and the other half in cash.)
