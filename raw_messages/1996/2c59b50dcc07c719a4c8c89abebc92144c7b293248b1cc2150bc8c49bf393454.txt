It seems to me that they are actually selling two seperate things.  One is
connectivity the other storage.  The storage might have a different legal
status than the connectivity.  So, is email part of the connectivity or the
storage?  What is the legal status of phone company provided voice mail?  This
seems pretty close to email.

Do we know that if phone companies kept recordings of your conversations they
would have the same legal status as the records that they already keep?

It would be good to get ISP's to work this way regardless of the law.  Its
better for the data not to exist than have it legally hard to obtain.
