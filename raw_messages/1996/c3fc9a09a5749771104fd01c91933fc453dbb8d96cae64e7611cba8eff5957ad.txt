Cypherpunks, Aaron -

>> I'm watching the LA NBC news channel, and they report that the Oregon "look
>> up any license plate" Web site is causing a flap. Though apparently legal,
>> the critics admit, the Governor wants the material removed.

( Aaron Nabil's page is at http://www.i.net/cgi-bin/plates , but temporarily
won't give you license plate information.)

A nice touch, at least for now, would be to put up some propaganda about
   "The State of Oregon sells your license plate information to anyone who wants
   to buy it.  Big companies have it.  Small sleazy companies have it.
   Tax collectors have it.  Car thieves and burglars can buy it if they want.
   Everybody but _you_ has it -- I've put it on the net so you can have it too.
   If this bothers you (and maybe it should), don't complain to the governor
   about it being on the web - complain that the State is selling your
private data.
   I've taken the server down temporarily, but press HERE for the Governor's
info,
   HERE for Senator Hatfield (AAA001), and HERE for the DMV head bureaucrat?"

If you want to get fancy, you could have the search return a FOUND / NOT FOUND
record, so people could check for vanity license plates (if Oregon has them),
or search for well-known politicians' information.  The data's there;
it's just a matter of crunching it.

        "Big Bro knows License Plate AAA001, Mr. M. H. "
        "Big Brother doesn't know License Plate AAA"
