	Hmm... I wonder if genetic algorithms would be a good way to analyze
traffic. Admittedly, this may be a matter of my having a (potential) hammer
and seeing things to bash with it.

	It should be possible, given a model, to add onto existing remailers
a routine that automatically forwards random messages through a random string
of remailers and back to itself (or into a /dev/null address; I can see
advantages and disadvantages in the resulting loss of information) at a random
frequency whose bounds are dependant upon current traffic levels at that
remailer. This might be supplemented by information based on statistics gotten
from other remailers. I would suggest Raph Levien (sp?)'s remailer list as a
basis for the random string of remailers.

	There is unfortunately a balance between what an operator will be able
to take - in regards to bandwidth - and what is needed for a web anonymizer
or remailer to work. For remailers, this requirement is greatly decreased by
the lack of immediacy needed.
