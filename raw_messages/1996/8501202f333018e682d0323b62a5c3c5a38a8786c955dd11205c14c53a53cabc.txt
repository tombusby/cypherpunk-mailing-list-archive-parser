Hello cypherpunks,
  My name is Jack Mott, and I'm the junior in highschool who posted the 
c++ source code a while ago, and as you can see it is pretty bad. ( self 
taught over 9 months ) Anyway for a science fair project this year, I 
would like to either create a new, or implement an existing encryption 
algorithm from scratch.  I need someone who has some experience 
programming in C/C++ and with crypto to get advice from and consult with 
from time to time. I have done well in science fairs in the past, and I 
could definitely win states with some help.  If anyone is interested let 
me know.

p.s. - there is another interesting twist to my project, but I don't 
want to give the idea away just yet.
