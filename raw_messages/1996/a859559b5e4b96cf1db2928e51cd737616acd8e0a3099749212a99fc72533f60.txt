San Diego Area CPUNKS symposium  Thursday, August 1st, 1996

   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at "The Mission
Cafe & Coffee Shop" were I hope to get an update of Lance Cottrell's
anonymous e-mail server, "mixmaster", exchange keys, and discuss other
topical CP stuff.  There's always the semi-topical discussions; Internet
Service Provider in San Diego (providing, anonymous remailers and other
privacy services), stelth communications, latest Cypherpunk goings-on,
Internet happenings (like recent Federal court decision).

   Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint.  If you can figure
out how to get it on the back of a business card, that would be cool.
