>AOL TEAMS UP FOR E-COMMERCE

	Well, at least they're making moves to get cryptography to the AOL
masses.... although somehow I suspect that they'll roll over and play dead for
any and all GAK pressure, and won't use any variety of truly anonymous digital
cash.

	One wonders what the FCC would do if they weren't US-based companies,
and if it weren't from satellites from such an interlocked-with-the-US country
as Canada.
