Scott Adams, the author of Dilbert, contributes this to the debate:

Communications Decency Act
--------------------------

The government of the United States has passed a law which makes it a
crime to transmit indecent materials over the Internet.  As a citizen of
this great country I plan to fully comply with that law.

>From now on, whenever I get the urge to use an offensive word in e-mail I
will substitute the name of an offensive politician.  I urge you to do
the same.

The beauty of this approach is that they can't easily ban these new
naughty words without changing their own names.  I know I could get in
trouble for suggesting such a thing, but I don't give a flying Clinton
what they think.  And if they don't like it they can come over here and
kiss my Gingrich.
