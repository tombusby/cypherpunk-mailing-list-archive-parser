That's a problem... data havens come to mind, but that's another issue.
Keeping the data in a domain/country where it is not restricted, or where
laws are very laxly enforced is one start... then the issue is using
crypto so that one can get the material from a country that restricts
it.

A price for maintaining security and anonyimity...

It wouldn't work, and would make them more interested in the material
that BBS has.  Any what about DMV/DOT employees, clerks, firemen, 
hospital employees, etc., who are non-enforcement people?

Encryption would restrict wiretapping.  If users send private encrypted
email to each other (Isn't there a PBBS program that allows users to
PGP-encrypt private mail to each other...?) that's another layer of
security.  Keeping the BBS on an encrypted partition also helps.

BBS's aren't as prone to snooping as networks are, but then again, why
should government employees be the only type of snooper?

The comm program could also implement a kind of zero-knowledge proof
or digital sig rather than the standard login, making the BBS secure
against someone hacking an account.

Just some suggestions to dilute the noise ratio...
