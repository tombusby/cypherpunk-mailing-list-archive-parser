	One other reason to have such a voluntary message is to account for
users/nyms who wouldn't want that they receive anonymous messages to be made
public. For instance, that would clue in someone that they might have a nym
at a nym-server, thus narrowing down the field for traffic analysis and
forensic stylology.

	The latter has the advantage of preventing spamming via flooding the
remailer.

	The possible problem of improper information going out (as per the
finger idea) is also the case with this one.
