No, the copyright is still valid, and NTT couldn't use the software without 
appropriate payment.

The purpose of the strategem I described is NOT intended to allow NTT to use 
software without paying.  NTT and RSA are probably on very friendly terms, 
anyway.  The purpose is to compartmentalize the illegality to an 
unidentifiable person, allowing NTT to use the software without having 
violated any law.
