I am attaching a program that does it for Unix.

/*
 * Syntax: wipedisk /my/directory/filename
 */

/* 
 *   This program creates a file with a specified name (which you must 
 *   supply) and simply writes pseudo-random data into this file. It 
 *   deletes this file after it filled the whole disk with this file.
 *   Actually it unlinks the file _right after_ that file was created
 *   to avoid shitting all over the place with dummy files left in case
 *   it was killed.
 *
 *   Therefore, this program may be used to securely wipe (delete) all
 *   data that does not belong to legitimate files. Pretty neat thing to
 *   use with PGP. Note that I am not an expert in secure erasure of data:
 *   if you use this program to delete criminal traces and FBI is going
 *   after you, talk to an expert first :-)
 *
 *   It wipes disk only once; call it several times for more secure
 *   erasure. If you run it more than six times at once, consult with your
 *   psychiatrist.
 *
 *   Note that user filesystem quotas may conflict with wiping the whole
 *   disk. Also, there may be some percentage of every filesystem (usually
 *   5%) that can only be used by root. It is best if this program is run
 *   by root. Note that for a short period of time this program can make
 *   all disk space used and not available for users. Please notify your
 *   root if you plan to run this program, because running it can create
 *   hardships for other users of your Unix system.
 *
 *   It is best run from root's crontab in the middle of the night, 
 *   when everyone should be sleeping and not hacking.
 *
 *   The file named in the argument 1 must NOT exist before program is
 *   called.
