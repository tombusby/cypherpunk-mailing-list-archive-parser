Hal is right that BlackNet was presented as a _specific vendor_. But the
announcement also described how _anybody_ could set themselves up in the
same way, by sending out a similar announcement with their own public key.

My purpose was to:

-- demonstrate the coming future

-- use a concrete example, "BlackNet," to drive home the point (people
often pooh-pooh an abstract idea until a concrete, reified version is
produced)

-- stimulate debate about anonymous information markets

I'll comment on a few of Hal's points, but, to save space, will not comment
on most of them.

Exactly. And this is how it was used for several two-way communications,
back in Sept-Nov '93.

An article on the cover of "Information Week" last summer triggered new
interest, and a couple of new messages addressed to "BlackNet"--the ones I
tried to read apparently used a spoofed key, or the one Dettweiler created
and placed ahead of mine on the MIT keyserver (the shorter key that the MIT
group was able to eventually break).

It could be used for direct communications, via pools, a la the classified
ad analogy that Jim McCoy just used (and that, in fairness, I used to
describe it in a talk at Hackers several years ago).

There is "BlackNet the company" and "BlackNet the abstraction." Inasmuch as
the recipe is easy to duplicate, "BlackNet the company" would face heavy
competition.

Exactly.

All sorts of automated vigilance can be done: scripts that scan newsgroups
and message pools, even Alta Vista-type spider searches, agents, etc.
Depending on the type of message pool, whether Usenet newsgroup, mailing
list, Web site, etc., various kinds of automation are possible. Which will
prove popular of course depends on a lot of factors.

Agreed.

Again, agreed. Evolutionary learning will take place, reputations will be
strengthened and weakened, as always. Certainly some fraud will occur, as
in all markets.

The point being that this information market will be anarchic, in that no
government or official hierarchy will rule on legality of data. Various
access mechanisms will be tried.

The Usenet and mailing list pools are somewhat slow, but have already
worked for things like "I'd like a copy of the Church of Scientology secret
documents." (In fact, in addition to "alt.religion.scientology," for
discussions and requests, there is the newsgroup
"alt.binaries.scientology," for posting anonymized copies of restricted
documents.)

That the latency is not as low as some other markets seems to be more a
function of nascency (is this a word? it should be) than intrinsic
limitations.
