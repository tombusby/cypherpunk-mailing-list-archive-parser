But if the government of the United States does play "fair," then why can we 
not play "fair" and kill their agents who violate what we feel is our 
rights?  After all, the government is merely the representative of the 
people (at least in theory!) and it 'must' follow the rules (laws, 
Constitution, etc).  To whatever extent it exceeds those limits, and to 
whatever extent the public can't get justice to prevent those violations, 
why would the public be obligated to accept them?

To believe otherwise is to believe that the government has some sort of 
special dispensation to violate the law.  I don't believe this; it wouldn't 
surprise me to hear that you do, however.  Which is it?
