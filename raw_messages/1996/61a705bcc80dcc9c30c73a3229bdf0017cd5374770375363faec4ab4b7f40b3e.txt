	CERN HTTP has a few problems:
A) It is slow
B) It requires client-software cooperation
C) Doesn't allow chaining
D) Doesn't do crypto.

	C2 will be soon announcing an anon proxy which eliminates both
problems B and C. Eliminating problem D will be done in the near term,
and eliminating problem A will be done in the long term.

	(BTW: We are in search of a gfx designer for this
project. Please contact me if you know someone)
