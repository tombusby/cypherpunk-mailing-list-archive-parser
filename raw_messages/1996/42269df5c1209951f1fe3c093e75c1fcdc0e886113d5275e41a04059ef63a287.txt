Respect or not, if your team is small and the field is large, and
everyone else is playing gridiron, then don't expect to prove anything
but your stupidity by playing cricket.

I agree, however you are confusing large parties, so dominant as to form
government and policy at whim with those that represent a particular
cause or interest group. The EFF falls into the latter category. Its
goals are relatively narrow, its membership tiny.  Such a small group,
fighting under-resourced battle against powerful, conservative interests
does not need, and should not espouse the arguments of those who seek to
destroy it. When Canoing up a waterful, one does not need to paddle
backwards 50% of the time in order to be "fair".
