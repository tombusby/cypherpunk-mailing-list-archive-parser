As you know, the President has transferred most crypto from State to
Commerce. We were all waiting in anticipation for the text of new
regulations to take effect on 12/30/96. Not because we thought that the new
regs will be more favorable to industry and the individual (we know
better), but so we could assess the damage. I will try to give a brief look
at some interesting provisions in the new regs. I assume the reader is
familiar with the carrot and stick (export of single DES and key escrow)
provision of the new regs. IANAL.

This post refers to the text of the regulations available at
http://jya.com/bxa123096.txt and
http://jya.com/itar123096.txt

The above URL's mirror [Federal Register: December 30, 1996 (Volume 61,
Number 251)], also available via
http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/aces140.html

First the good news: the export controls mentioned in the draft of the regs
on any kind of data security software, regardless if it uses crypto or not
did not carry into the final version.

Now to the rest of the news. 

>equests for one-time review of recoverable
>products which allow government officials to obtain, under proper legal
>authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the user, the

The GAK provisions require that the keys are made available without
knowledge of the user. This disqualifies some of the suggested key recovery
schemes alerting the user to the fact that keys are being requested.

>A

>notwithstanding Sec. 734.3(b)(2), encryption source code in electronic

Printed source can still be exported. Source printed in special OCR fonts
will eventually be banned.

Finally, to the big one:
>Sec. 736.2  General prohibitions and determination of applicability.
>
>* * * * *

>U.S. persons--(i) Support of Proliferation Activities (U.S. Person

IMHO, this closes the door on the foreign contracting loophole used by C2
and others. It is now illegal for US persons to finance or contract out
overseas crypto development, since doing so will obviously assist in
proliferation. While not unexpected (I offered a bet on Cypherpunks that
this would happen. Nobody took the bet.), this provision sets a dangerous
precedence. The technical assistance prohibitions of the past have been
transformed into general prohibitions against "financing, contracting,
service, support, transportation, freight forwarding, or employment".

Again, IANAL.
