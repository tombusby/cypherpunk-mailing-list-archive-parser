Fingerprints, yes.  Floppies, perhaps not.  At the least, it means you
have to have hardware on site and someone has to work swapping floppies.

I've done a signing where we all send out keys to one person.  He
distributes a keyring to all participants. Then we meet, exchange
fingerprints in person, take the prints home and sign in private.
All the participants mail their keys back to the collector, who
returns a keyring with all keys, properly signed.  I always hand out my
Certified Computer Geek[tm] card, which has only email addresses, web
page and key fingerprints.

I suppose that depends on whether you want to associate a nym with a
physical person.
