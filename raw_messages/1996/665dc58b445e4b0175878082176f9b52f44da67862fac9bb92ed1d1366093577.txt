I'm all in favor of it.  The POP3 client I write to cash those little
digital droplets and tell the spammers that I *love* to get their ads, read
each one for 45 seconds/page, scroll thru them lovingly, and reply to the
specified address for much more information, has the potential to pay for my
master's degree.

Call it the SpamMonster(tm).  ("Spam is for money, that's good enough for me")

Therefore, in order to actually make their system work, they'd need to send
out their own special mail readers.  And I'd disassemble one and
SpamMonster(tm) would continue to eat their spam, ad infinitum (pun not
intended, but it works really, really well, n'est pa?)

I do not believe it is possible to have a secure executable that exists on
an uncontrolled user's machine.  "Tamperproof" encryption chips still
require communications in and out from the user's program.  A determined
attacker could continue to use the pieces of their code that talk to the
encryption chip.

Never underestimate the allure of "free money" when you're planning to give
it away.

Hmm.  Reading ONE message from them puts me on a "Spammer's blacklist"?
Without the e-cash incentive, sign me up!

Depends on your point of view  :-)  I certainly think it has potential!
