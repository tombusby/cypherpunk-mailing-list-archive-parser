I think this is a policy issue, not a technology issue. In general, key
owners should be able to sign certificates that say arbitrary things, 
regardless of whether or not some third party agrees that the statement
being signed is "true". Unless you believe in libel, slander, etc., which
raises policy issues of a different sort entirely.

The John Birch Society can sign something claiming that I'm a member. 
A policy that says that's sufficient information to conclude that I *am* a 
John Bircher is a broken policy. A policy that requires both the above and
a signature by me on the same certificate, among other things, is viable.

Your description is a bit ambiguous. Do you really mean "readable", or
do you mean "verifiable" ?

If the former, it sounds like this could be handled by distributing 
signed certificates encrypted with the issuer's public key. 

If the latter, you could distribute signed certificates but not the public key
needed to verify the signatures on the certs.

It might be handy to use a hybrid approach, such as distributing signed
certificates that refer to encrypted entity names (suitably padded with
random bytes to avert trial encryption of plaintext guesses).
