The reason for the 40 column screen was quite simple - many customers
did not want to shell out a few hundred dollars for a monitor, and
instead installed a cheap RF modulator and used an old TV for a
screen. The resolution of a TV is inadequate for 80 coumn text (think
about the smallest easily readable text you've seen on braodcast or
cable).

The Apple ][ did not include the RF modulator because it wasn't FCC
certified with one - but every dealer also sold $20 modulators tailored for
the machine. With the unshielded plastic case, I could wipe out any other
TV within 30 feet - a significant distance for a NYC apartment dweller,
which I was at the time.

While it was not the first machine I programmed (the PDP-8e has that dubious
honor, circa 1971), I learned a lot from my Apple ][. Among other feats, I 
added lower case support to Apple Kermit, and implemented Life in 
6502 assembler using HIRES graphics.
