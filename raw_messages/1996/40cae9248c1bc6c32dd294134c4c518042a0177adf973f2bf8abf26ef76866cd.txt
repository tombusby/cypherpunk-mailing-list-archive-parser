I am expecting them to use the Interstate commerce clause in the
Constitution to enable them to enact whatever rules they want without that
pesky "freedom of speech" thing getting in the way.  I am sure that any
commerce secretary that dare to loosen the export restrictions would
quickly find him/herself out of a job.

Clinton and Gore have both shown that they get arroused at the thought of
being able to read everyone else's e-mail and listen to their phone calls.
I don't expect them to do anything that would thwart that fetish. (Power is
the ultamite turn-on.  When you can pry into the details of every part of a
person's life, you have a great deal of power.  Clinton/Gore/etc have shown
no resistance to that seduction.)

I expect that this will add more bodies to the LaBrea ITAR pits, not take
any away.

Waiting for the third shoe to drop?
