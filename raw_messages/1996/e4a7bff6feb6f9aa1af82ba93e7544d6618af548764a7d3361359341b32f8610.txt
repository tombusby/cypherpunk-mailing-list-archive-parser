The Portland Cypherpunks meeting is still on.  We will be having 
a key signing.

Reminder about time and location:

Location:       The Habit Internet Cafe
                21st and Clinton in Portland OR
                http://www.teleport.com/~habit/  for more info.

Date:           January 20th, 1996  (THIS SATURDAY)
Time:           5:23pm

So far I have received only four keys for the key signing.  I am 
kind of disappointed about the results of the proposed key signing 
for the meeting...

If you are planning on attending, even if you are not planning on 
participating in the key signing, I need to know so the Habit can 
plan for the added influx of people.  So far I have a large pile 
of "maybes" and few confirmations.                           

If you have topics you would like to do a presentation on, please 
give me information on it so that I can distribute it to the other 
participants. (Or bring it up before the meeting.)
   
                           *** NOTE ***
Teleport (my ISP) has been having mail problems.  If you have sent 
me mail and not received an confirmation, please resend.  I may not 
have received it.

Currently, there is only one other speaker confirmed (besides 
myself).  I would like to see more input from the rest, so this 
does not just become a one way spouting of information.

The one confirmed speaker will be presenting some of his findings 
on remailers involving reliability and getting nyms to function 
for those not versed in the field.  It should be useful information 
for anyone using remailers.  (He had a few findings that surprised 
me...)

I have had a few interesting "maybes", but I will wait until (or if) 
they show up...
