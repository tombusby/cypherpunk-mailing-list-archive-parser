Hmmm- I think this could be interesting to study; if we treat the space 
of possible passwords as a non-uniform probability distribution 
(Zipfian?), and then transform it in such a way to be uniform (by 
having the probability of certain passwords being disqualified be 
based on their relative probability it should be possible to get a 
situation where all passwords are possible, and all have equal probability.
This gives optimum security ( I think). Of course there's then the game 
theory assumption that the attacker will know about this and try paswords 
randomly; if they instead attack passwords with a non-random approach, 
the optimum passwords will be tuned to their attack strategy, unless they 
know you're tuning to their attack in which case they will tune their 
attack to your [stack overflow - bus error, core dumped]

 Interesting exercise.
