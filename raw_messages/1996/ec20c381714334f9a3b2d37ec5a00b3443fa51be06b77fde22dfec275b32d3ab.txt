Indeed, Bill Stewart (and someone else whose name I forget) are right.  I
had it in the back of my head that you don't want to harass the user.  If
you are willing, as in PGP, to ask the user to enter some entropy, then
there you can get some sources of randomness which may be good enough. 
However, do be conservative.  After being conservative, gather 10 times as
much as you thought you needed.  The models of entropy in scribbling are
none too good.
