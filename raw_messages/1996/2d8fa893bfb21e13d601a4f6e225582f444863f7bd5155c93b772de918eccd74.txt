Considering the relative strengths/hardnesses of the metals involved 
(high-grade steel for barrel, lead and/or copper for projectile), I'd 
suspect that it would take more than 200-300 rounds to have any significant 
impact on the barrel rifling. This, of course, is for 'normal' weapons and 
ammo; using diamond projectiles in a saturday night special voids all 
warranties, express or implied :-)

my ha'penny's worth.

PS - Been using Pronto Secure beta software the last couple of days for 
email. It's not Eudora, but *very* convenient for signing/encrypting. A 
couple of bugs/gotchas, but nothing I'd expect to see in for-sale version.
I'm actually mildly impressed with how smoothly and transparently it works 
with PGP on a DOS/Win95 system.
