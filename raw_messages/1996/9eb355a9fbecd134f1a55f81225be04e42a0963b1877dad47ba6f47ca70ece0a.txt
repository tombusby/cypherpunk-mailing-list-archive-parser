Optical amplifiers -  they are in use all right.  Want to buy one?
My employer sells them.  (get out a big checkbook though -
gotta cover my salary ;-)

This is essentially true for the purpose of quantum-crypto. 
The cascade of phontons triggered from the incoming photons would
mask most of your original phontons - necesitating a secure "repeater".

Power for the amps must be electrical.  So, a seperate power cable must
be run seperate with the optical-fiber.  This normally isn't a problem
since the casing/etc of the fibers has lots of metal for protection anyways.

Very nice! ;-)  Flouride based amplifiers should be able to handle up
to 16 channels.  Using state of the art time-multiplex stuff of 10 Gb/sec
gives a total throughput of 160 Gb/Sec.... smoking!

Of course the parts for all of this will set you pack a sizeable 
chunk of change.

If you want to see some further reading about optical amplifiers
as applied in a telephone network - find a copy of "Telephony" 
a trade rag.  There is an article by John Moss and ??? here at Alcatel
that explains stuff in high level terms.  (little to no physics stuff)
