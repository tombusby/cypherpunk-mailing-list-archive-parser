The technical details look vaguely familiar, but I probably last read them 
two decades ago.  It doesn't sound like  it would be too complicated to 
implement, with ordinary phase-lock loops, switched-capacitor filters, and 
other analog building blocks.

I'll  have to look that up.  Was it a DSP or some analog implementation?  
Most importantly, does it seem to WORK?

Yes, it occurs to me that a vocorder-type compression/decompression of the 
voice would, effectively, remove FM modulation by averaging out short-term 
variations in voice frequencies.

I think it's particularly revealing that the TV networks don't try to use 
it.  They're supposed to be looking for an edge, something to make the news 
seem more interesting.  The political establishment would see the 
publicizing of  this as going beyond an unwritten limitation on the media.
