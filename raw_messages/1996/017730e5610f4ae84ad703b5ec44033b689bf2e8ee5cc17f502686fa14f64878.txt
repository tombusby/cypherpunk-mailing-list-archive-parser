While I agree that reverse-engineering/analyzing the internal states of
VLSI devices is much harder than some are claiming, it is not the case that
a chip must have been designed with this in mind for it to be possible.
When, then, is it possible, and when is it not? There is no simple answer;
I'd have to look closely at the device, its packaging, how many layers of
metal are involved, the size of the target node to be measured, and a raft
of other things.

Well, this is my third post tonight on this thread. I admit that it has
little to do with practical list issue (but then, what really does?).
Howvever, this happens to be an area of primary expertise for me (device
physics, voltage contrast, SQUIDs, sensing small charges, and
tamper-resistance), so I'm making comments to correct the various
misapprehensions here.

As to tamper-resistance, there is some exciting work being done on
"fingerprinting" of chips, some of which has been publically presented. I'm
under an NDA on some of this, but I can say that the cost of
reverse-engineering a smart card chip or satellite decoder chip is about to
take a quantum leap upward.
