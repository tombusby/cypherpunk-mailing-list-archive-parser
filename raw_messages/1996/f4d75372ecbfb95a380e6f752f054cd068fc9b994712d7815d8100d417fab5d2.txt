I concur. Lists of links sans unnecessary editorial commentary would be
useful; counter-propaganda is distasteful and counterproductive.

I hate to bring up those damn Nazis *yet again*, but hey, this is as an
example, not for their own sake. Compare the following approaches to "bad
ideas."

http://www.wiesenthal.com/watch/index.html
Does not provide any links. Just says "look out, they're out there." IMO
ineffective, begging too many questions.

"Let's make the 'bad guys' look good by comparison!"

Lists of links with minimal editorial comments. Pretty good IMO.

Voluminous primary documents, with no editorial comments. Excellent.

Has the effect of glorifying the opposition. A very popular site among the
Nazis. Sheesh.
