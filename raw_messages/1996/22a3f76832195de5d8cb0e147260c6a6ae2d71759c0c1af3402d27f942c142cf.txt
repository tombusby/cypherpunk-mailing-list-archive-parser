Economic espionage is costing the nation billions of dollars in lost
business every year.  U.S. companies are in danger of losing everything
from trade secrets and proprietary financial information , to the bottom
line figures on contract bills.  Three bills are now in Congress to
protect government, business and home computer users from outside
snooping of sensitive information.  These proposed new laws have been
written to encourage the use of encryption and loosen export
restrictions on encryption technology.  Congressman Goodlatte is the
author of one of these bills.  April 1996 is also the 20th anniversary
of the creation of Public Key Cryptography.  The three principal
pioneers and patent holders will also be present to share their views on
the need for strong encryption.  Morris of Cylink Corp. will provide an
overview of what state-of-the-art security solutions are needed, and
available, to truly protect business from unauthorized access.  James
Freeman of the FBI will discuss the recent study on industrial espionage
and Paul Raines from the U.S. Postal Service will talk about electronic
postmarking and certificate authority key registry bureau.
