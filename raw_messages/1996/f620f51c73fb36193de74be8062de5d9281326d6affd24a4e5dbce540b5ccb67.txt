I haven't seen this article, but I wouldn't hold the cover photo of Freeman
draped in the flag against him....I seem to recall a few Cypherpunks
similarly draped in the flag in a magazine article!

The photos used for stories are even more a matter of artistic choice than
the editing of the text is. Magazines are competing for rack space with the
likes of the several hundred other magazines, and covers are getting more
and more garish and more freakish. (I've ranted about this on other
occasions, so I won't here.)

It's all about sensationalism. I take a jaundiced view of yellow journalism.
