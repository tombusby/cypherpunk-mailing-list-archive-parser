To support Tim's thesis, I'll point out that I use the following lisp
configuration directives (among others) along with a news-highlighting
package that I hacked up (gnus-live.el) in order to make reading this
list (bridged to a newsgroup at my site) a much nicer experience.

When I enter the newsgroup, the authors and topics that I like are
highlighted.  I read this 5% of the list in about 15 min, skim another
5%, and then delete the other 90%.

- From my perspective cypherpunks seems to be pretty * HIGH * bandwidth!
