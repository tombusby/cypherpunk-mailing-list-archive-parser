Interesting - thanks for the result.  Do you know how tightly tuned
the crack implementation was (e.g. straight C with MasPar optimizer,
hand-tuned assembler, etc.)?  Since the MasPar has a large number of
very small processors, I'd expect it to be better at bit-twiddling
than conventional processors.
