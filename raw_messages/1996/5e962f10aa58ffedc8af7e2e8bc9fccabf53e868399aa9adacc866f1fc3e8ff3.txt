Why is it that whenever I read Denning's pronouncements I feel like I am
reading something from a villainess in an Ayn Rand novel?  

Denning has become the epitome of the pure authoritarian government world
view.  Analysis of her viewpoints makes me more of an anarchist every time I
read her rants.  It is that smarmy "We know better than you do" with
absolutely no rational argument as to why it is true.  It is people like
this that are generating such distrust in Government by promoting irrational
statism.  (Government by random fiat keeps a high employment for those who
make their living off of political parody, paranoia of the government, the
court system, lawyers and lawmakers, and anarchists everywhere.)

Depends on your ability to challenge the status quo.  A vague law with lots
of harsh but undefined penalties is much more effective than something that
is rigidly defined.  With rigidly defined laws, you can find loopholes and
ways to push the envelope.  With vague rules, people will tend to err on the
side of caution.
