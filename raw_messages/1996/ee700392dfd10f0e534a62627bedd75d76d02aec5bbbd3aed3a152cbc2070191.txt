	Quite simply, if freedom is defined by a social contract, then there
would be no need for a Bill of Rights. Protected freedoms are there because
even a democratically elected government - the closest thing to a determiner
of the "social contract" in the real world - cannot be trusted. For instance,
the current social contract in Germany would apper to say that some political
speech - that of neo-Nazis - is not permitted, and that this is not a violation
of freedoms. It is reasonably evident that this is not the case by any
true definition of freedom.
	Certainly, if someone can murder you for speaking your mind, your
freedom of speech may be restricted. But I again defy you to come up with how
many of the activities you oppose are violations of anyone's freedoms, as
opposed to violations of what most people happen to want.

	It would appear that you are incorrect with regards to the right to
encrypt and anonymous remailers; such regulations and laws as ITAR restrict
this, as do some movements toward mandatory government-access-to-keys (the
eventual intended result of Clipper, which has certainly not disappeared from
the intentions of law enforcement and espionage agencies). I have previously
pointed out the ways in which the child pornography argument does not work,
and is only an excuse.

	I am not physically attached to the Internet; it is not possible for
my safety - as opposed to my hard drive's safety if I connected it - to be
compromised by the Internet.
