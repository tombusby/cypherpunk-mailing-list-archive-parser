The machine CAN have a floppy...but it must NOT be bootable. If the 
floppy is able to be used to boot, than it is not C2 complient.

Remember C2 is not out of the box. Being C2 certified means that the 
machine can be MADE to fulfil orange book requirements, not that it 
is automatically secure. A machine can have a floppy, but it must 
than subsequently be removed or unable to be booted before it is C2.

This is not just floppies, but CD Rom drives etc as well. It must be 
configured to boot from ONLY the secured devices
