I don't really understand how such a system would work.  It would either
require some kind of centralized system to receive information from each host
being monitored, or each host would have to contact another and relay the
connection information.  The former would require too much bandwidth and the
latter would open up hosts to easy eavesdropping attacks.  The only alternative
is for sysadmins to monitor syslog activity which is (hopefully) done already.

Unfortunately, httpd is very insecure.  First of all, cgi scripts are very
difficult to make secure and can be exploited quite easily.  There may also
be buffer-overflow problems.  It's about as difficult to make connection
redirectors safe from cracker use as it is to make anonymous remailers safe
from child pornographers, terrorists, and other horsemen.
