What I was trying to propose was that you provide a key for usage when
they first initiate usage of your site. They could then use that key to
send stuff to you. Neither party needs to know who the other person is,
merely that he is using the agreed upon key. This would let you revoke
the keys of offenders.

I'm assuming most remailers allow 2 way traffic. Alternately, just send
email to the remailer operator. Rather than get spammed by the
bounceback, he would probably block that site from sending to you... (Or
revoke their account entirely)

I was using PGP as an example. If you really want portable, use that Java
PK library and write a custom frontend for it.  You just need to use an
agreed upon key for verification. Now, if they wanted, a secure method
might be using PK-aware remailers - pk channel from you to remailer,
using your keys, pk channel from remailer to them, using their keys. This
would let you exchange a key securely... Of course, it would involve
trusting the remailer operator, but you'd have to do that anyway.
