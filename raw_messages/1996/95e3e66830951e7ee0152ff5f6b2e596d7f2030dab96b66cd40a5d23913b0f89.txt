I think what he means is that they use virtual rotors built out of very
long primes. I.e., write down n very long primes, one per line. Shift each
prime number by a the number of positions indicated in an m by n key. Pick
a column. Read the column top to bottom. Use the resulting number to xor
with your cleartext of lenght <= n. If the cleartext is > n, use the next
column(s) as well.

Just a guess.
