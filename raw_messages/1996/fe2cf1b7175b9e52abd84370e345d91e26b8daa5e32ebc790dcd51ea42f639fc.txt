That's the RIGHT answer!  Historically, governments have wanted to deny 
dissident-type people the freedom to spread word of their opposition to the 
rest of the population.  This just made the problem worse, ensuring that 
they'd have to use violence to get the word out.   The problem fed on itself 
until these people became "terrorists."  The best way to stop this cycle is 
to allow these people to talk to us, and the web page is the modern form of 
talking.

Be _very_ suspicious of anybody who wants to continue to isolate people he 
calls "terrorists."
