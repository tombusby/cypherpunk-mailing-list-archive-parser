There are various amounts of persistence, depending on which kind of "pool"
is used:


* Usenet newsgroups have a persistence of days to weeks, depending on one's
particular site. This is enough for parties to find each other _if_ they
are watching (or having agents watching). And of course Usenet archives are
expected--Alta Vista and Deja News has Usenet articles going back several
months in many cases.

* Mailing list message pools (a la Cuperman) have an effectively infinite
persistence, if parties archive the messages.

* Web-based message pools, which to my knowledge have not been used yet,
would have a persistence as long as the messages are archived...which could
be very long.

Rather than _persistence_, I'd say _access time_ or _latency_ is a more
serious criticism of my approach. In contrast to a large library or
bookstore, with access times of ~minutes, the access times for material on
BlackNet may be ~days to ~weeks. Or, of course, "never."

I grant that my version is not like a "Mega-Barnes-and-Noble" bookstore,
with vast amounts of stuff available for browsing. It is more like a
"stacks"-based library. (Many universities have lesser-used books,
sometimes _all_ books, in "stacks," accessible only by qualified
librarians, or by permission.)

Some have focussed on "place," by focussing on ideas like offshore buoys,
orbiting broadcasters, and, of course, on finding accomodating
jurisdictions that will tolerate data havens in their midst.

You and I may agree that data havens need to be virtual. I'm just proposing
an architecture--and certainly not the final version!--that actually works.
Others can suggest their own alternatives, or build on versions that are
out there.

What if only one person has a copy? Nothing in *my* concept of data haven
says anything about information being free, or cheap, or widely available.
Books aren't usually free, of course, so why should information be free

The issue of what happens if someone buys an item and then republishes or
redistributes it is, of course, orthogonal to the discussion here. It's a
tough problem, and the basis of the "information wants to be free"
aphorism. But not a key issue for differentiating forms of data havens, as
I see things.

I agree with the "classified ads vs. shopping mall" distinction. In fact,
it neatly summarizes the latency/availability issues. So be it.

Until the "shopping mall" exists, I'll settle for the "classified ads." If
BlackNet and similar systems function adequately as an anonymous classified
ad system, this will be an improvement over what exists now, which is, of
course, "nothing."
