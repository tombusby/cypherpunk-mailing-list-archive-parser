OSF ported Linux to our microkernel which is derived from Mach 3.0
from CMU. And we have ported our kernel and the Linux server to
PPC. Of course some of the functionality that is in Linux was replaced
with micro-kernel functionality. That was the point. The Linux server
implements the higher level OS functionality like the file system,
process management, networking, signals, etc. The paper presented at
the Conference on Freely Distributable Software describes some of the
technical details.

We have also ported OSF/1 to our microkernel. Both servers are layered
on top of the same microkernel. Perhaps you are confusing the
microkernel with the OSF/1 server?  Anyway, you don't have to worry
about getting any OSF/1 code. OSF/1 is licensed software. It is
illegal to distribute it freely.
