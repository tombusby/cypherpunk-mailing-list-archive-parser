Actually I was thinking more along the lines of physically stealing, 
but if someone sniffed an electronic transfer of a record then the 
laws would become even more useless as far as enforcement goes.

Considering that their sources are probably more reliable (even 
though less knowledgable), and considering the idiocy of such an 
idea, I would risk saying that they are right :)

There are solutions to this that work.
1) The Greatful Dead approach - let everyone bootleg live shows.  Who 
cares?

2) The Frank Zappa Approach - take the bootlegged copies, use better 
equipment, and possibly your own soundboard recordings of the same 
show, and put them out yourself.  Since you are capable of putting 
out a better product sonically, then beat them at their own game
