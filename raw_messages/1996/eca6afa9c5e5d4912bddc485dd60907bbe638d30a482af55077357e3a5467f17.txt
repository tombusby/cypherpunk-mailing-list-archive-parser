    attila sez:

	well, I take it as assumed correct that illegally violating the
    credit and personal information of member os Congress (might as well 
    include the Clintons and the Gores) would get a response on privacy.

	but you would be a targt of an incredible manhunt. For example,
    I can give you the name of an online information provider (if I was
    so disposed --which I am _not_, as I do not wish to be labelled as a 
    conspirator) who would provide the credit, medical, and background 
    reports of 500+ individuals for $20-25 a pop.  then you take out an 
    account on a system with a false id and does not require credit cards 
    (pay cash, not cheque)  --mail each one to the target rep/sen/bubba 
    after mailing the whole set to Geraldo, or some other slimball.

	but, I think I would put my money on further laws to really 
    clamp down on free speech. and, if you ever were caught, don't 
    expect all of us to donate one day a month for 10-50 years to visit
    you in the slammer.

	more laws, more political police, more prisons  --that's their 
    motto. 

	enjoy
