Jim:

This is a nice idea, but it's not going to happen.

Yes, Harry Browne has raised enough money to qualify for matching funds
from the FEC. But he's unable to give out the cash or use it to pay down
the gvt debt since doing so could violate FEC regulations. The FEC is also
unwilling only to certify Browne for matching funds without giving it to
him -- he's got to take the money and spend it on campaign foo and nothing
else, says the government. Finally, once they give you cash you have to
meet a higher degree of scrutiny, which costs money in lawyers and
accountants.

Talk about bureaucracy.

At least this is what the party tells me. I'll be covering their
convention, which is in DC a few weeks from now.
