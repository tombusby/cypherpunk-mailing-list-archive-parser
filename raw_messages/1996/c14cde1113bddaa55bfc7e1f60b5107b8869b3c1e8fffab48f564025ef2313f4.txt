So are bearer bonds, stock warrants, coupons...

There are any number of bearer instruments that are not "currency."

Not technically true unless it is specifically structured this way.  It's 
more of a bearer draft.  Because digital cash is a token used by the bank 
to represent currency, which is backed by a government, digital cash, in 
it's current form, is a second tier bearer instrument.

This is so of checks too, but the processing time gets in the way.

See above.

Ditto uncashed checks.

Actually, it looks more like circulating dcash is a subset of outstanding 
obligations.  Same as, e.g., letters of credit.

Making a check payable to "cash" makes it, for practical purposes, a bearer 
instrument.

But instead of backing in gold, or some tangible asset, dcash is still 
ultimately backed by the full faith and credit of the government who's 
currency the dcash is denominated in.

I still think the essential issue here is the manner in which the ecash 
is based.  If it is based on government currency, the U.S. dollar, then 
it is still just a second tier bearer instrument.

I think that the diet coke backed cash I tried to promote back when was 
closer to a "currency" than d/ecash issued by a bank and drawable on 
government currency.  (Maybe this is why no one was interested?)

Real solid ecash, and the kind of cash I would like to see out there, 
would be limited to a non-dilutable one time issuance and backed in some 
precious commodity held on reserve.  A closed-ended share of a stock of 
gold, for instance.  That would require no intermediation of a "currency" 
based on the full faith and credit of an issuing sovereign.

Private currencies are not private currencies at all if they have to be 
linked to a government issued denomination.
