Actually, I suspected and reported the same bug some weeks before the group at
Princeton.  <URL: http://www.aztech.net/~steve/java/~>.  That said...

This is exactly what I would say.  Sun has released source code for what that
they label as "Beta Software."  I agree with their labeling, and don't fault
them for having buglets in beta software.  I commend them for releasing souce
code.  My biggest gripe is with other companies (no names mentioned) who are
shipping Java, integrated and "turned on" by default in their
"production-level" products.

Generally good advice.  (SET is an "Alpha Specification" and has its own
problems, that I won't go into here, but again, I commend the principals
involved for allowing "outsiders" to view and comment.)

I'd also add that running uncertified (by the local CA) applications is bad 
voodoo, and should be avoided, but that's an issue that most admins don't have 
much real control over in most environments.
