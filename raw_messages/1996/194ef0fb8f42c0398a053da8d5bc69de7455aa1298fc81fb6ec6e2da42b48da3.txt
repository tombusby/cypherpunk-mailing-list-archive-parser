You seem to be forgetting that one of the provisions of (I believe) the 1986 
tax act was that capital gains would be indexed  for inflation.  However, 
the sleazy politicians only scheduled it (the indexing process) for about 
1990 or so, and by 1990 they managed to get that idiot Bush to agree to drop 
it.  I don't know the details, but this is yet another of the reasons I have 
no qualms about advocating a system for solving the "politician problem" by 
putting them 6 feet under.

Lawyers who profit from an abusive system may disagree, of course.
