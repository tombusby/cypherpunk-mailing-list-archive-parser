I'd have to disagree with you on this.   Based on my experience in 3 widely
different districts, such behaviour/problems isn't likely to result from the
school environment.  It's a function of the family life these kids have.   If
they come from a disfunctional family, kids are going to join gangs, get 
pregnant , use drugs, etc no matter what school they're at.   If they have
the right background, it's not going to happen.  

Of course, in some areas (esp. inner cities) the rate of social dysfunction
is extremely high, so some schools are 90% 'problem-kids' as well.   I'd
reccommend against having a homeschooled kid go to one of those (unless
you've been using the Cypherpunks Homeschool Plan For the Instruction of the
3 Rs,  Martial Arts, Bomb-Making, Assasination and Black-Helicopter
Countermeasures.  I imagine school would be very popular if some list members
were teaching)  just because it would significantly reduce the opportunity
for them to catch a stray bullet or something.   I still doubt that a
homeschooled kid from a strong family would join these groups.
