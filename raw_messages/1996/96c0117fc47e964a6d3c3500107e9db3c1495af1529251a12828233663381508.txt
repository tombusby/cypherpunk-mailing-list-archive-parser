I admit that Bob can play games by altering the list of which currencies
(other than his own and Alice's) he is willing to accept from Alice. All I
was attempting to point out was that in the simple example you stated
(Alice does not have enough TrustBucks( Bob ) to pay off a debt to Bob so
she "Buys" the amount she needs by using TrustBucks( Alice ) and then
immediately returns the TrustBucks( Bob ) as her payment), the initial
transfer of TrustBucks( Bob ) is all smoke & mirrors (and a bookkeeping
trick) since he is still accepting payment in TrustBucks( Alice) not
TrustBucks( Bob ). The net result is that he is canceling some debt by
accepting the TrustBucks( Alice ) which he might later use to pay Alice for
something.
