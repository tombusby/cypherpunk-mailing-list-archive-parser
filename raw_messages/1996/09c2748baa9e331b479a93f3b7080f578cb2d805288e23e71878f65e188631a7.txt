I don't know the final outcome, but I do have a couple of observations...

- The person at the front of the line, making the suggestion, will always
vote for his own proposal, if only to save his own life. This is obvious. 

- The second-to-last person is in an interesting position. If everyone
before him is dead and he gets to the front of the line, he will decide
that he gets _all_ of the money for himself. If there's only two people
left, his own Yes vote for his own proposal makes 50% and he automatically
gets all the money. This is the best possible deal for him. So, I think
the second-to-last person will vote No to every proposal except his own, 
in an effort to force this situation.


Now that I think about it, solving this 'game theory' scenario has some
parallels to cryptanalysis (disclaimer: I am not a cryptanalyst). By
pointing out the above properties, I've removed a couple of 'bits' from
the 'search space'.
