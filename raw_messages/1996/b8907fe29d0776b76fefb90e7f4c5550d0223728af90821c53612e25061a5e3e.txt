1100 sounds pretty far into the IR spectrum for silver-halide film to pick 
up, but I don't know how far they can "push" film to do this.  Silicon CCD 
image pickups peak at somewhere around 900 nm, but they can probably handle 
1100 nm at a reduced sensitivity.

Do you mean "constant" over time?  Fingerprints are fairly constant, I 
assume artery and vein number and location is fairly constant too if major 
weight gains and losses can be ignored.  What I don't know is how unique 
such blood vessel patterns are, compared to fingerprints.  The huge numbers 
frequently given to show how unique fingerprint patterns are, and thus how 
reliable fingerprinting techniques are often based on a full set of 10 
fingerprints, not just one print.
