Yeah, place your bet that Tim writes these trolls and answers 
them, pumping the conversation, fostering coy controversies. 
Smart guy, bores easily, likes to lure the rubes, he says. Toy 
with them, spout outrageous remarks, act indiginant when they 
are challenged, feign hurt, let suckers defend him.


Sometimes mimics Rimm, may impersonate him, too, or coach 
Marty, who knows? He's got lots of Net personas, seldom non 
grata. He's a vintage infotainer, California dreaming, an 
export techno-wine of the region.
