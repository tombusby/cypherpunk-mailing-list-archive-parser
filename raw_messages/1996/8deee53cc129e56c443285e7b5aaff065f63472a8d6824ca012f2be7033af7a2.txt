> May 21, 1996 -- AUCKLAND, New Zealand -- A fledgling startup, RPK New
> Zealand, today announced that a new public key encryption system,
> known also as RPK, is available free, for review and evaluation on the
> World Wide Web.  RPK is inviting worldwide evaluation and scrutiny of
> their new system with the goal of creating, for the first time ever, a
> worldwide industrial-strength security and encryption standard.  The
> company is also offering a free version of an end user program
> designed to be used for secure transfer of information to encourage
> use and trial of the technology.
> 
> RPK New Zealand is one of the new, very small, "worldwide entities"
> that has benefited from the global market access provided by the
> public Internet.  Previously kept confidential while patent
> applications were being filed in  New Zealand and for the rest of the
> world under international treaty, the RPK cryptographic system was
> unveiled  this week via the World Wide Web (http://crypto.swdev.co.nz)
> where the technology's inventor, Bill Raike, has also offered a
> US$3,000 "RPK SafeCracker Challenge."
> 
> Raike, a mathematician and computer scientist who has dual U.S. and
> New Zealand citizenship, combined some simple algorithms with well-
> accepted higher mathematics to invent the world's fastest-ever system
> for secure communications  and he's betting US$3,000 that no one in
> the world can break into RPK's Virtual Vault and thereby prove him and
> his fledgling startup wrong.
