People have been dealing with viruses and malicious programs
since the dawn of PCs. (Before that even, really.) This is not
news. A virus or trojan horse can do something much worse than
the (possible) inconvenience of a "bad guy" getting your credit
card number.

Whether you're a business or an individual, having, say, your
hard drive wiped clean by a virus would be several orders of
magnitude worse than the relatively minor inconvenience of
having to get unauthorized items deleted from your credit card bill.
This is just as possible as the credit card scenario FV is
painting, and PC owners have been dealing with this kind of
threat for over a decade.

Rather than focus on something as tame as credit card numbers,
let's look at what else a malicious program could do if it had
unlimited power over your PC:

  o Ransack your tax preparation files
  o Compress and transmit your financial information to your
    competitors or to Blacknet.
  o Capture the passwords and logins that you use while telecommuting
  o Use your dial-up bank-by-computer software to make unauthorized
    transfers.
  o Reformat your hard drive.

The fact is, malicious programs are a threat that has been in the
background for over a decade, and PC users with any experience to
speak of are familiar with at least the rudiments of dealing with
this class of problem. If anything, they're more familiar with this
kind of threat than more network-specific threats. (Look at the huge
sales of popular anti-virus products.)

Sure, there are clueless people out there, but the solution is to help
make them less clueless, not to stampede them in a panic, which is
apparently FV's goal here.
