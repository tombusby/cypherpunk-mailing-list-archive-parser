	While I think your ideas are certainly good, and will work out
well, they are not necisarily the "best" way (although, any means to the
same ends are essentially the same, assuming no drastic measures, i.e.
Machavelian concepts).  Its a shame that in the US, teachers seem to be
afraid to teach the term "Civil Disobediance".  

	I think its a shame that people in 20th Century America are afraid
to stand up against their government.  I'm not saying rebel in the
streets, but there are certainly other things one can do when a law is
unjust.

	One idea is simply to give them so many cases that they can't
_POSSIBLY_ pros^H^H^Hersicute <g> them all.  If _EVERY ONE_ of us went and
made it perfectly obvious that we beleived the ITAR is wrong, forceful
implementation of GAK is bad, and that we don't give a fuck what they
think, or that its "illegal" to export crypto, then they wouldn't stand a
chance.

	Just a suggestion.  I'm certainly not a brave enough person to do
this, but I wish someone was.
