	I would be curious as to whether you believe that China should be
permitted to do censorship as part of "national law." If your answer is yes,
I would ask if you would believe that Germany's Holocaust was something that
should be permitted as a part of "national law." In other words, national
sovereignty is not something that should be permitted to override individual
liberties.

	It is only theoretically a voluntary system; governments such as
China's, Germany's, etcetera could require that it be used with these
goverments as the TRA (or, essentially equivalently, someone licensed by
such a government).

	If the bits carry information, then restricting the bits is restricting
the information. I would point out that no harm whatsoever is being done to
children in the _distribution_ of such pornography; such harm is only done in
the _manufacture_ of such pornography (if, that is, actual children are used;
currently there are various efforts to make computer-simulated "child
pornography" illegal.)
	Quite simply, you've invented a system that makes censorship more
possible. As a scientist, I try to avoid areas that have such negative
effects; I won't work on biological warfare, for instance. I would like to
suggest that you follow such ethics also; you have not.
