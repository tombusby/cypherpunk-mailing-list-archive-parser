No need to be so defensive, Mr. Bell... I didn't say that samples used to
detect drugs are OK under the constitution. I just said that, IMNALO,
samples taken for identification have always been okay. The samples taken
to detect unauthorized molecules are the exception to the identification
rule I noted. I do agree that requiring people to provide such samples to
detect illegal substances (as I said, a recent development) is wrong. 

I wasn't trying to score points for either side of the debate, I was just
pointing out that _before_the_war_on_drugs_, the samples listed in the
previous post were used exclusively for identification.

Handwriting, fingerprints, and voice (not to mention name and appearance)
are still used exclusively for idenitification. Breath and urine (items
that I added when I mentioned the war on drugs) are used exclusively for
detecting chemicals (although I think DNA can be found in urine). 

Just my two bits. That's all I'm willing to spend on this discussion. 
Only time will tell whether or not the courts will force people to provide
encryption keys.
