Just go to your boss and tell him that you have an offer from a
consulting company. You'd be happy to continue working for him
until he finds a replacement (which could take decades) for 90%
of your old pre-tax salary. You should get a big smile in return.

And I believe that you don't need that. Going to a major offshore
vendor makes you vulnerable to traffic analysis (most of them can't
spell Mixmaster). You can get a better setup for $2999 than you get
if you spend $50k. Or do it yourself for $1k. Start by reading
everything from Scope (www.britnet.co.uk/scope). The books you find
there cover everything you need to know in perfect detail.

Thanks to Philip Zimmermann and Lance Cottrell the balance of power
between the state and the little guy has changed completely. It's
good to see that both of them are going into mass market business.
Perhaps they can get some of the billions of dollars they deserve.
