How on earth can a service try to stop anonymous dealings. Well.. i can see
HOW... because they say their just going to do it. Now.. I know theres such
things as the internet task force....etc... Isnt there any groups out there
whose _SOLE_ purpose is trying to protect rights in the online community?
