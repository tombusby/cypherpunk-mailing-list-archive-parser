I expect the majority of our anonymous account to be telnet. We are 
setting up the contract to make it clear that any contract signed with a 
minor is invalid, and that any access of our system by that individual is 
actually illegal (various statutes on misuse of computer resources are 
quoted).

I don't know about posting the agreement. My lawyer may not want to see all 
his hard work in the public domain. I will ask.
