12-16-96. NYP Book review:

  Fermat's Last Theorem:
    Unlocking the Secret of an Ancient Mathematical
    Problem
  By Amir D. Aczel

The world has many worlds, with the priestly cult 
of mathematicians, so mystifyingly and inaccessible 
to most people, among the more esoterically 
interesting of them. Aczel describes the intrigue
and double-dealing in the international world of
mathematical speculation, some of which involves
Andrew Wile's proof of Fermat's theorem.
