Whoahh! Hold on there, Jimbo! You're crossing the line.

You're coming perilously close to actually calling for the killing of a
federal judge. My recollection is that a couple of folks have been arrested
and charged for calling for the killing of judges.

You can skirt the issue by saying, in your "literal reading" mode, that you
have not called for any such thing. However, we have read your
"assassination politics" stuff ad nauseum, and it is clear from your
language above that you are suggesting that this judge be made the target
of one of your "betting pools." This is a plausible reading of your words.
What may save your bacon, if any law enforcement or district attorney types
are reading this, is that you are sort of the "neighborhood whacko" and
your ramblings are unlikely to be acted upon by anyone, including yourself.

Still, it does your "idea" no good to be talking about using your
"assassination politics" scheme to have a judge whacked.
