I've heard that in a lot of cases, too, automobiles have been the vehicle 
used by the prep. to transport bomb-making materials and bombs to/from 
their target sites.  I'm starting to get concerned that this type of 
personal transportation technology makes it just too damn easy to wreak 
havoc and destruction on unsuspecting innocents.

I think they ought to pass some kind of legislation restricting the use of 
vehicles that do not have approved travel-itineraries on file with the 
Travel Escrow Bureau.
