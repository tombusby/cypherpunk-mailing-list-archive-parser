I think this is a phony distinction.   Practically every product sold today 
could arguably "aid criminals."  It isn't possible to prevent this.  And 
that's the problem with your thinking above:  If government argued that it 
had the authority to regulate any product that, arguably, "aided criminals," 
then it would automatically be able to regulate anything.

Given that item we just read about Burma illegalizing the non-authorized use 
of fax machines and modems, that is a vast understatement!

Just a second!  WHy should technology bow to government policy?  Until now, 
the microcomputer industry has pretty much developed and sold products 
without much or any (?) regard for what governmental policy would desire.  
In fact, it isn't even clear that governments have had much opinion about 
the direction that the microcomputer markets should go.  Why should we start 
adjusting business policies and product capabilities in a way which is 
hostile to customers, just because the government wants this?

Why not ___NOT___ help these guys out?  Do they somehow deserve to be 
assisted in the subjugation of their people?  Does the name "Zyklon B" ring 
a bell?

I would much prefer a situation where freedom is provided and/or guaranteed 
by technology, and it is NOT debateable!  See, one problem is that contrary 
you your implication above, where you said that crypto policy becomes 
"politically debateable" (which implies that the ordinary people of a 
country have some input) the _reality_ is that any such decision will be 
made by a tiny number of bureaucrats, if they can get away with it.  The US 
Clipper proposal was a classic example of this:  There was absolutely no 
public discussion or debate on it before it was announced, and it was 
obviously intended to be a fait accompli.   Further, nearly all 
non-governmental people who are aware of the crypto issue disagree with the 
government's policies in this matter.  Clearly, you cannot imply that crypto 
will REALLY be "politically debateable"!

No, I think I _will_ blame your infernal invention for trying to make 
limited communication possible!   There's no doubt that the leadership of 
places like Singapore might want to restrict communication, but on the other 
hand they also want to be connected to the rest of the world for 
"non-political" speech.  In effect, they are forced to make a choice.  Most 
countries, except for a very highly authoritarian few, will probably opt for 
connectivity and this will lead to increased freedom for the people in their 
countries.  _YOU_ are trying to give those governments connectivity while 
maintaining tyranny.  Are you proud of what you're doing?

I think the terms "voluntary" and "abuse" are contradictory in your 
statement.  If the system is "voluntary," then it is presumably "voluntary" 
to use a non-conforming system, right?  And unless the government's goal is 
to harass or imprison or fine  the user for not using that "voluntary" 
system, there is no purpose in knowing whether a person's use of encryption 
meets that "voluntary" standard.

I see:  "How each society decides to use our thumbscrews is totally 
voluntary and up to each country!"

Pardon me while I puke.

I'm much closer to "the wild west" than you are, and I like it just fine.  I 
prefer it much better than the tyranny of stratified societies that have 
enslaved people for over a thousand years.

Maybe you need to remember that the way governments use it, the definition 
of the word "voluntary" tends to pick up a rather Orwellian meaning.  Also, 
you need to remember that the difference between a "voluntary" and a 
mandatory system may be as little as a single law passed in the middle of 
the night by a legislature.  A law which you are intending to make possible!

You seem to have ignored by conjecture, where I pointed out that Internet 
backbones and ISP might, hypothetically, be required to check keys and 
report "violations" to the government on a moment-to-moment basis.  Further, 
they might be prohibited from forwarding messages that do not conform.  

This gets us back to the definition of the world "voluntary," again.  Even 
if such an eventuality should occur, the government could cynically say that 
use of non-conforming forms of encryption were still "voluntary," because 
it's true you could use them.  But they wouldn't be very useful if they 
didn't propagate on the Internet, now would they?

Not if the cooperation of everyone else is coerced!  And moreover, not if 
they are coerced into not dealing with anybody who doesn't go along.  

You must really hate freedom, huh?
