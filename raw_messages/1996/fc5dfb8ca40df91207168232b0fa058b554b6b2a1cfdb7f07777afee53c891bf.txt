To add to this point, "all XYZ is economics." (Crypto, security, customer
preferences, etc.)

A K-Mart or Radio Shack might place a value on any customer's spending
preferences at, for instance, $0.035 per $100 spent. This is just a figure
I'm inventing to make a point; market researchers within K-Mart or Radio
Shack probably have better estimates.

Thus, if customers give information away for "free," as many do, then a
Radio Shack will naturally try to collect this information. Even better if
they can get info about earning power, neighborhood, magazines subscribed
to, etc. Some stores try to collect this information.

In any case, few stores will turn down a sale because this $0.035 or even
$0.10 "value" is denied to them.

It's always about economics.
