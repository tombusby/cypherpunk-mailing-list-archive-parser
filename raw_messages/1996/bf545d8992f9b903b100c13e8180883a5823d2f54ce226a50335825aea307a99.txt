For those not-yet-in-the-know: I no longer have the time to manage it 
and asked for somebody (and Matt agreed to) to take the Snake Oil
FAQ's care and feeding.

Note that this is not cc'd to coderpunks. I don't 
think it's appropriate for coderpunks.

Does it need to be posted monthly?  Better to post pointers to it 
most of the time, possibly to other places as well  (alt.2600 comes
to mind...).

Perhaps when the first 'non-beta' of this document is released a 
History could be added.

Or more clearly: is encryption THE feature of the utility, or is it 
an added feature?  It's better to use separate utilities made for 
that purpose rather than one that tries to do everything.

Change to "making brute force attacks--that is, trying every possible

That's a controversial comparison. I've read references (from a 
couple of years ago) saying that a 3k-bit RSA key is as strong as a 
128-bit IDEA key.

Trying to compare the two (symmetric and assymetric) is like running 
through a tar pit.

Of course, how is an amateur supposed to know if these terms are 
found in the literature? That was a recurring comment that people 
sent me when I first posted the FAQ.

Hm. How about "that are widely believed"?

Although it is(?) mentioned below, I'd emphasize here in some way that 
the users of the OTP generate the key.  Somebody else sending you a 
supposed OTP that he generated is not secure.

Explain random session keys and initialization vectors.  A glossary 
at the end of the document would be a good thing.

Oh yeah.  These need to be explained.  What I had in mind was timing 
attacks against RSA or IDEA, or factoring of public keys.

"often" not?!? (oops...was that my wording?) They aren't the same, 
though often they are confused in snake oil.

That is, if you lose the key, you don't want a third party to have as 
much a chance to recover it as you do.

Also... if the vendor does not understand export restrictions, avoid 
the software. I'm thinking of a certain snoil-vendor who said 128-bit 
IDEA keys were'nt secure since they could be exported.

Such exportable versions are not as secure, of course.

I wanted to add some sort of 'non-guru hacks' to test a product. One 
example might be to actually examine 'encrypted' files to see if they 
are really encrypted. (I'm thinking of the AMG archiver, which only 
encrypted the CRC; CODEC archiver also only encrypted the CRC is a 
file is not compressed.)

Thanks again for taking over the FAQ.  A good job!
