I think that's exactly where the problem lies.  The advantage of your
proposal is, that for an honest SysOp your system makes it easier not
to look on the database, but I assume that Julf isn't interested in
the contents of the database anyways..

But for a real attacker it's just a small inconvinience, nothing more.

I think it's similar to a postmaster running a script to automatically
removing the actual message from a bounced mail, before she looks at
it.  But I don't think it's really making penet-style servers more
secure.


Have a nice day, and hope your flu cured now!
