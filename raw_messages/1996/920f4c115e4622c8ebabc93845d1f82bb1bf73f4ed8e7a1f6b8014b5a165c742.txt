You're right.  A pipe bomb isn't even technically a "bomb".  It just has
various combustible chemicals within a sealed container.  The explosive force
is just due to the high pressure released.  Nails and screws can be used as
shrapnel, but if the container was scored, the explosive force would be
weakened.  Newer hand grenades have scored wire wrapped around the core so
when it explodes, the container is shattered and the wire fragments fly out
at very high speeds.  I would guess that these are more powerful than the
"pineapple" grenades.
