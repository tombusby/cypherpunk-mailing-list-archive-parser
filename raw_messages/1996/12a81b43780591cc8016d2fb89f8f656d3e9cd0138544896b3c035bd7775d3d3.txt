I agree with my namesake that WhoWhere is one incredibly fucked-up operation.

I tried to add an entry for myself, and my entry has (after several days)
not made it. (I tried to be truthful, including such things as "felon" for
what I do...perhasp their Thought Police considered my entry a joke,
suggesting that they must be applying their own judgment to entries.)

I then figured that some of their "automatically generated" entries for
"Timothy C. May" needed correction. Not suprisingly, the system asked for a
password, so I was unable to correct their defective entries for me.

Fuck em. Then burn the body.
