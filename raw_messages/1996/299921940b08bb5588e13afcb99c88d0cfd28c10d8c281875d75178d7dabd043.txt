History already has examples of such incidences. Alaska, California, and
other states have tried various levels of legalization. To date I believe
that all such experiments have ended because of federal pressure on the
uncooperative states.

The Indians 'right by treaty' to operate gambling casino's is another good
example of a contemporary situation.
