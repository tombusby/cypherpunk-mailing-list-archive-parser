Actually, believe it or not, I may have an obscure one.

Said of those hauled before a court and ordered to disclose secret
banking records, even though doing so will subject them to severe
penalities and even jail time on their return home:

"...the defendant should feel the full measure of each sovereign's
conflicting commands and so choose between laws of those two sovereigns."
Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Rio Algom, Ltd., 480 F. Supp. 1138 (N.D. Ill.
1979).

Of course in this case the U.S. measures were rather a bit more dire, but
it does suggest a tacid recognition that there is nothing literally
illegal about being in contempt of court, even if it was an attempt to
resolve a conflict of laws problem in this case.

It's also worth noting that contempt of court is rarely punative in
nature.  (Different rules apply when it is).  Instead, it is coercive.
Force is applied in increasing measures until the individual either gives
into the court demands, or it is clear that force will not be of any
effect.  There is no real law being broken per se, merely an exercise of
power by the court.  If you comply, sanctions will be removed.  The only
sanctions which will be preserved after the fact will be those which were
levied to enforce compliance prior to that compliance.

All this is entirely academic in any event to the original point.  There
is no defined right to be in contempt, only the right of the court to
enforce its rulings and to compell testomony of unwiling witnesses.  The
fact that an act is not illegal does not make it a right.  There is
nothing I see in the constitution to support the argument that it is a
right in any way shape or form to refuse a lawful order of the court.
