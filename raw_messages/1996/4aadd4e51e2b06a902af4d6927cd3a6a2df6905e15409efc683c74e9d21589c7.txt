Yup. Sen. Exon and this staff demand that IP be redesigned to include such
a flag. No doubt, we'll soon hear about demands to include a male/female
flag, a cast flag (there go another two bits), a flag for meat
eater/vegetarian, a flag indicating your HIV status, one they get going,
the sky is the limit.

Sure. Access control belongs into the application layer, or somewhere
nearby. The problem is that those in power wouldn't know a modem if it bit
them in the ass. Expect legislation that mandates routers to support the
various flags in the near future.
