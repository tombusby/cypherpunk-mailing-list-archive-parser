Come now, surely you don't think putting assassination into the hands of 
the common people (Democracy, yes?  The same stuff Clinton is preaching 
all the time, remember?) is going to be worse than letting governments 
control all the action?  If you're going to allow governments to do the 
job, you and your fellow citizens should have been more involved in the 
political arena, to monitor these kinds of activities, so the government 
(of the U.S., for example) didn't have to get such a bad reputation.

A few years ago, William Torbitt (pseudonym) wrote in part: "Penal codes 
have had two historic purposes - to deter crime and reform the offender.
.....However, when the head of the National Police agency joins with a 
handful of other govt. leaders, and they both in turn throw in with 
organized crime to murder the president, and the people have an uneasy 
feeling that something of this nature has taken place, it is only 
natural that crime and violence increase, and the basic deterrent to 
crime has broken down." (quote approximate)
