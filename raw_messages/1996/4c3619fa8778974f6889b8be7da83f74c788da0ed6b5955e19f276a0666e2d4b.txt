You should take your own advice.  The mere fact that the first link in the chain is "known" doesn't mean that it is provably involved.  Without a substantial amount of bugging that the COS hasn't the resources to do, there is a big difference between them _believing_ that a given message originated there, and being able to prove it in court.  And notice my caveat:  "As long as the message subsequently passes through at least one trustworthy remailer, and probably a temporary output address."
