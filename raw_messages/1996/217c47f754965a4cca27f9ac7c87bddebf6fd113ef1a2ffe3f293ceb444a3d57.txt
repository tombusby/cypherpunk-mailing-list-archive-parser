   "Companies fear losing privacy, customers' trust." 
 
      In a show of self-reliance reminiscent of the old West, 
      companies are taking matters into their own hands, 
      hiring security firms to protect their computer systems 
      and ignoring the convention that law enforcement is the 
      best defense. It's a stance that has implications for 
      law enforcement and commerce, raises broad questions of 
      privacy and control, and pits the philosophy of the 
      Clinton administration directly against that of many 
      Fortune 500 companies. "An organization has very little 
      to gain" by reporting, says Lloyd Hession, of IBM's 
      Business Recovery Services. 
 
      There seems to be universal agreement that the strongest 
      means for securing computer data against theft lies in 
      cryptography, but the Clinton administration, citing 
      fears that criminals would use cryptography to cloak 
      their activities, is setting regulations slowing 
      development of cryptography software. 
 
      The Clinton administration is to announce, as early as 
      this week, a commission to determine the federal 
      government's role in securing cyberspace, from terrorism 
      to petty crimes.
