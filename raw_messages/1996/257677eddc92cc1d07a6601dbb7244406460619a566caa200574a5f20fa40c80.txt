	Hmm... I wonder if it would be good for this Foundation to itself
operate some for-pay remailers, in order to make some money from sources
besides contributions? Possible disadvantages:
	A. It could get sued, and thus lose funds
	B. If its prices were set too low, it could wind up driving other
remailers out of the market (combination of low price with likelihood to still
be there), and thus become a vulnerable point.
