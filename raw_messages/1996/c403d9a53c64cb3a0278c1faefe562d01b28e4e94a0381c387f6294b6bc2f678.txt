Hi all,

MRTA is a bunch of terrorists, irrespective of whether the issues they are
trying to deal with are legitimate. They have threatened to kill people
if they don't get their way. This alone is enough for me to not support 
them. They also have taken their internal bitch outside their unhappy 
home and involved other nationalities. If they were my neighbors I would
call the cops and if allowed on the jury I would give them the max.

What I would suggest is that the Japanese take as many of the MRTA out
as they possibly can.

I support the Japanese. Screw the MRTA and the Peruvian government, little
Hitlers are little Hitlers.

Banzai!
