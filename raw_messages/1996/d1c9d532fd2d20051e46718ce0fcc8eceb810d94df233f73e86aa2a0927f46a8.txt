	The interesting "cultural sovereignty" variation on the usual "national
sovereignty" excuse for censorship and other such unethical actions. I'm
reminded of another Asian state that used it... after Tianenmin Square. At
least one member (the Phillipines) is making, at the minimum, lip service for
freedom of speech. US control over them does appear to have done some good.
