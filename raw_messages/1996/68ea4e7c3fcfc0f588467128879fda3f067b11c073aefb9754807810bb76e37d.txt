FWIW, I am (and have been) adding everyone who asks to subscribe to 
coderpunks, in spite of what the welcome message says. (I don't have control
over that :)  But the charter is much narrower than the cypherpunks list's;
I expect many cypherpunks subscribers wouldn't find the coderpunks traffic
particularly interesting. 

I volunteered for the dirty job of "enforcing" the charter by throwing 
people who ignore it off the list. This arrangement has the obvious 
disadvantage that I can capriciously eject people from the list. It has the
arguable advantage that I am willing and able to not-so-capriciously eject 
people from the list. Only time will tell whether this model will succeed or 
fail in some sense.  

If you want to join coderpunks, my life is made slightly easier if you
mailto:coderpunks-request@toad.com rather than sending directly to me.
