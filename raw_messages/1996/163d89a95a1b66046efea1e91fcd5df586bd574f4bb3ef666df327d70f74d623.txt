Yes, this has been public record information for at least 15 years.

Which is located in Ft. Meade, etc etc.  Yes, we know.  That's why the 
big interest on this list for military grade encryption for ensuring the 
privacy of personal communications.  It's also why there's such a big 
push by governments for key escrow technology.  Governments want to keep 
this "edge", the existence of which hasn't yet penetrated popular awareness.

For more information on the subject, search some magazine indices or 
archives of this list for the keywords NSA or National Security Agency.
A surprising amount of information, including all of what you've mentioned, 
and more, is readily available in the public record.
