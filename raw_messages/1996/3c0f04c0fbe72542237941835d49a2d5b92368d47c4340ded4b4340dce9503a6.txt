Uni, can you forward this to the c-punks for me?

PEP: Pretty Easy Privacy, a set of scripts for OneClick that integrate
Eudora and MacPGP are now available in the latest Button Circle release at:
<ftp://ftp.westcodesoft.com/pub/westcode/Contributions/OCButtonCircleMarch96.sit
.hqx>

PEP is designed to provide features similar to the UNiX premail program on
the Macintosh. It handles encryption, decryption, signing, verifying,
anon.penet.fi remailing and cypherpunk remailing.

PEP uses OneClick to place a button bar in Eudora, from which the user can
select privacy functions. Buttons pop-up menus of encryption targets,
signature keys and cypherpunk remailers.

Q: What do I do about the rest of MacPGP's interface?
A: PEP is not designed to replace MacPGP, just to provide easier access to
it from within Eudora. For a full featured MacPGP GUI replacement with
added features, try Raif Naffah's MacPGPControl application.

Q: Isn't the name 'PEP' pretentious and derivative?
A: Yes, I think so too. I couldn't think of a better one. Suggestions are
welcome.

Q: I have a lot more questions. Where are the answers?
A: In the documentation. If you have any more questions, please direct them
to <mailto:aelberg@wesleyan.edu>
