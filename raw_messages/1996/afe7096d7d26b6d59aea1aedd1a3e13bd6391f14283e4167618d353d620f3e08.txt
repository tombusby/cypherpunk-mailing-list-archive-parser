The code is still out there to look at. I warn you though, it is steaming
horse manure.  ;)

No, it is not in the key block. It would be passed during the negotiation.

Call me paranoid. After asking and reading around I decided I wanted to
cover my bases. It looked like, in the future, it might be easier to break
with small generators. This is not a critical decision though. I too would
have liked it longer, but using RSAREF I am limited. That is one of the
reasons I have each remailer creat its own DH modulus, and allow it to
change it periodically.

You have spelled out why I like having each remailer use its own modulus.

I chose C. The in protocol I developed the sending remailer (A) sends a
hash of the DH modulus to the receiving remailer (B). If B has it, they use
it. If not, A sends it. I use the modulus from A because it has the stake
in privacy. B will take messages from anyone, but A wants to know the
messages it has goes to the correct other remailer B.

Here is a description of the protocol I wrote many months ago. The message
assumed the above discussion of distributing the DH modulus.

--------------Start Old Message--------------

It is too bad that I was never able to debug my socket code. It is more or
less all done. The advantage of the socket code is that it allows the
message to be super-encrypted with a DH negotiated key which provides
forward security for intercepted messages. There is a built in
authentication for the DH (against MITM attacks) in the RSA key used to
encrypt the remailer message to the next remailer. I can send the code I
wrote to anyone on demand (within the US of course).

This basically pushes the key authentication job onto the original sender
where it belongs. The key ID (16 byte fingerprint) is visible in the clear
in the header of the message remailer A is about to send to remailer B.
Remailer A either has the key corresponding to that fingerprint, or it
requires remailer B to send it the key. Remailer B must have the key or it
would not be able to read the message any way. A different RSA key can not
be sent because of the strength of the MD5 fingerprint.

Remailer A sends its DH key half to B along with a challenge number, all
encrypted under B's RSA key. Return of the challenge number along with B's
DH key half, completes the authenticated exchange. The second half could
also be encrypted with a 3DES key provided along with the challenge number
if desired.

The whole point of all this is that if the message is intercepted and
presented to B with a demand to decrypt it, B will be unable to comply,
even if it wished to.
