   "Investigators Look at History of Terrorism to Compile a 
   List of Suspects in Crash." 
 
      Over the years, terrorists have demonstrated frightening 
      expertise in making bombs and concealing them. "The fact 
      of the matter is that we found out terrorists could 
      create bombs that were very, very difficult to detect," 
      says the FBI. 
 
      "A fairly small amount, well placed, can do the job," 
      said Dr. Jimmie Oxley, of the NRC's airline security 
      committee. "A colleague once said he could do it with a 
      gram, in the right place." 
 
      Bomb-making technology continually advances, as Israeli 
      authorities discovered in 1986 when they intercepted a 
      suitcase being smuggled in from the Gaza Strip. The 
      terrorists appeared to have spun the suitcase on a 
      centrifuge that allowed the plastic explosive to flow 
      into its corners and virtually disappear. 
 
      Ariel Merari, who has studied hundreds of terrorist 
      incidents, says bombers are limited only by their own 
      imaginations when it comes to building bombs and finding 
      ways to get them aboard airliners. "However," he said, 
      "the use of sophisticated bombs are more likely to be 
      the work of state-sponsored terrorism than anything 
      else."
