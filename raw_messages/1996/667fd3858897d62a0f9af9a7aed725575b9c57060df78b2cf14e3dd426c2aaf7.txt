I am glad to see some movement in this area. I designed a similar system
for a previous employer of mine. But the real choke point is the local
loop. As of this day, the local telos still have a de facto monopoly in the
local markets. The new competitors (the same old Phone Company) that we
will see in the near future seem to show no desire to deliver the really
interesting services that are now possible. They long distance carriers
about to enter the local markets plan to offer the same old stuff at a
(perhaps) somewhat lower price.

The company I used to work for has technology capable of delivering a 10
Mb/s Ethernet plus 100 ISDN B channels to your home, using the very same
wires already in your wall. Keep this in mind next time you hear what great
new services the local telcos are about to offer. Then demand better.
