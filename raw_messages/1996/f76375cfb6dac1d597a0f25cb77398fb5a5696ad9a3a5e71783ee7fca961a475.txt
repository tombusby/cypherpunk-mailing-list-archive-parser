Should kids have crypto? [weapons]

Should parents teach their kids crypto at an early age?

Should kids have a right to privacy?
        If yes, should there be a limit to the privacy they hold?

Under Itar crypto is a weapon.  If a kid were to bring a disk
containing pgp to school could they be expelled for carrying a weapon?

Should children's legal rights be taught at school at an early age?
