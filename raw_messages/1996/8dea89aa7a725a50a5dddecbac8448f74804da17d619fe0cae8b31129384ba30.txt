Plain cryptography isn't the main point.  The protocols (such as anonymous
digital cash, message pools, DC-nets, etc.) allow things to exist that are
not possible without cryptography.  These protocols make laws (especially
victimless laws) much more difficult to enforce.

In order for anonymous remailers to be completely anonymous, only one remailer
in the chain has to be trustworthy.  If a message is chained through N
remailers and N-1 of those remailers are run by spooks, the anonymity of the
message depends on the remaining remailer.
