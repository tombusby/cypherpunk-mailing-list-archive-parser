I am amused. I gave Dave Hayes about an 8.5 out of 10 on the scale of
meaningless political rants.

I'll address some of his points.

* "Political safety?" I stand by my record as a writer. Check out
http://www.eff.org/pub/Publications/Declan_McCullagh/ for some of my
recent articles. Political safety? Hardly.

* Dave says "Notice that the net is compared to a home or private club." 
Wrong. I never compared the Net to such. However, a mailing list run on a
computer in someone's home with his own cash is very similar to a private
club.  There are private speech restrictions on the Net. Gated communities
exist.  Try to join the "lawprofs" mailing list. You can't; you're not
(and quite obviously anything but) a law professor. Censorship? Not quite. 

* Contrary to what you seem to be asserting, Gilmore hasn't blocked Vulis
from posting. 

* Dave warns us to consider "what would happen if one parent company owned
*all* communications media." Then we have problems. I've written about
this in an Internet Underground magazine column. However, this is not the
case now. Or are you arguing the government should get involved and force
Gilmore to allow Vulis on his list?

By the way, if you haven't figured it out yet, Mr. "Freedom Knight of
Usenet,"  a private mailing list is NOT Usenet. Get a clue.
