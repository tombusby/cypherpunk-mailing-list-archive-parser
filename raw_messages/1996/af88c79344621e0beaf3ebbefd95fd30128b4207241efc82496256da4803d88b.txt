Let me see if I understand you correctly.  The scheme you describe says 
to calculate X=(D^2)^(1/4) as the signature and check D^2==X^4 for 
verification.  You are wondering why you can't just calculate Y=D^(1/2) 
as the signature and check D==Y^2 for verification.

The problem here is that some D's don't have square roots.  For a Blum 
integer n, only 1/4 of the numbers between 1 and n-1 have square roots 
mod n (they are called quadratic residues mod n).  For a D that is a 
quadratic residue, the X and Y above are equal.  But for a D that is not a 
quadratic residue, Y can't be calculated.  X can still be calculated in 
this case, but X^2 != D.
