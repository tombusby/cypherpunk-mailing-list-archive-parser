That's not quite correct. The part about it not
being known, I mean. I created a key:

	Type bits/keyID    Date       User ID
	sec  1024/DEADBEEF 1995/09/28 Prime Rib Lovers
	sig       DEADBEEF             Prime Rib Lovers

(note: DEADBEEF seems about the most interesting
8-character hex word -- CAFE doesn't seem to go
with anything...)

And Christopher Drake (http://pobox.com/~netsafe)
has mailed out a key which has a company
advertisement in its ASCII armor. Hmmm. I thought
I kept it around, but I can't find it. Ahhh.
There it is.

I still assert there are a bunch of attacks
related to producing on-demand keyid's.
