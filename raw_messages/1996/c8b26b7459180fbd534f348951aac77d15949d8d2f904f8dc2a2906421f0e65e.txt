I didn't say anything about your liquidity did I?

Which is why people are constantly trying to get their services for what
is in effect nothing.

So would I, however, the assumption that "cypherpunk crypto review
services" are to be had for nothing is the height of arrogance.

If you were sincere, you'd thank them with cash.  Afterall, you seem
to suggest that you have a good deal of liquidity eh?

Uh, the kiss ass paragraphs were the reviewers comments, not your code.

Are you so used to attacks that you see every comment as one or what?

THAT, is the key of your ignorance.  Endorsements are valueable if they
bring business, period.

Picture big ole MJ on TV with his suit and tie holding up your product and
proclaiming that his multi-level global investment strategy would be
impossible to do the way he does it without pronto-secure.

Not worth 99c?  Please.

Make all the money you want, but I grow weary of seeing "review my product
and get a consolation prize" deals.  I doubt I'm the only one.
