  Doug, 
 
 
  I bought the disks offered in the first edition. 
 
  I expect to buy those offered in the second. 
 
  The contents of the disks may be available in some rogue archive. 
 
  In headbuilding as in bodybuilding, you have to pay your dues. 
 
  From Counterpane Systems, you can order: 
 
      Applied Cryptography Source Code Disks 
 
         A THREE-disk set of over 100 encryption programs for 
         algorithms such as DES, RSA, IDEA, Blowfish, and many 
         more.  Most of these programs are in the public domain, 
         and can be integrated into working software products. 
 
         These disks are updated twice a year, and subscriptions 
         are available. 
 
         Disks: $40; 2-year Subscription: $120

         Now you can subscribe to a newsletter covering the latest 
         advances in cryptographic protocols, algorithms, and tech- 
         niques. 
 
         Among regular features, an "Algorithms Watch" summarizes 
         recent cryptanalytic results against block and stream 
         ciphers.  "Recent Patents" examines U.S. patents awarded 
         in cryptography and related areas.  "Product Data" dis- 
         cusses protocols and algorithms in hardware and software 
         products. 
 
         A must for anyone who needs timely information on cryp- 
         tography.
