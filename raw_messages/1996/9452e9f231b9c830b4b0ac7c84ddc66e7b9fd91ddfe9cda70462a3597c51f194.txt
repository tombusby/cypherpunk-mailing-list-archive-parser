__________
If you're planning on being hungry on 29 April, get more info or RSVP and
reserve a seat by calling:

The Churchill Club
2323 South Bascom Ave
Campbell CA 95008

408.371.4460 voice - ask for Lisa (try pressing #0 at the menu)
408-371-4180 fax

There's a suggestion that you _could_ pay by sending your credit card info
over the net (ironically, I see no public key being provided, but that's
AOL for you...). For the foolhardy, the address is: <chrchllclb@aol.com>
Alternatively, you can send it to <kmitnick@ax.netcom.com> or
<donations@lsd.com>  ;)

__________
Notes:
* Sen. Dole hasn't confirmed yet, but he's co-sponsor of the Encryption
Communications Privacy Act, so if there are no high-visibility Senate votes
or major campaign babies to kiss on-camera, chances are he'll paint a
target on his back and kick it with us.

The speakers alledgely include representatives from all three Congressional
legislation groups. Expect the Press to attend.

Other confirmations are still coming in from additional participants.

For the price of a Van Halen ticket, this should be worth a giggle or two.
