I haven't bothered reading this particular thread up until now, but in my
opinion, based on this drivel, you're getting dangerously close to being
certified officially by the Cabal as an ignorant kook.

Of course it does. However, to maintain community resposibility must also
increase.

Hogwash. That's community again. As respect and care for my neighbor's
peace and quiet I lose the freedom to blow leaves on a Sunday morning. This
is independent of what the law says.

Hogwash again. Law and law enforcement only exists due to the failing of
such societies. Prisons and executions are the ultimate failure of a
society. Their existence (like hierarchical structure) is not a given. But
if it is all you know, then of course it's what you assume.

And don't forget that it is fundamental that law and law enforcement also
protects predators from citizens. Your analysis is rather one-sided.

True, but there are individuals before community.

Wait a minute. A large number of people living in a utopian paradise?
Surely this is ideal. If there were the crime and activity you describe,
then it would not be utopian and would not be paradise. But maybe this is
paradise, but only to a criminal.

And interesting that you use the world "still". You obviously equate
"unorganized" with "backward". You even say "rural". You a city boy by any
chance?

You said it. You fail to understand. The reasons are obvious. Your eyes are
closed, your mind is shut, and you can hardly be heard over the traffic.

Freedom for whom? Freedom, like technology, is neutral. Laws are always of
the form "You shall" or "You shall not". Laws against mugging (to protect
the citizens) do not prevent muggings. They restrict the freedoms of
muggers and eventually incarcarate them. The existence of muggers causes
people to restrict their own freedom, by not jogging at night etc. Mugging
is a social and a community failure. A "good" law against the activity
reduces overall freedom while simultaneously failing to address the
problem. In short, a simple, ineffective, but visible fix. A perfect
business for politicians to be in.

Sure. It means that the community can continue life as normal without
realising that the Mayor is gay. She does a fabulous job, everyone gains,
the community is very secure. Or shall we throw some FUD into the equation,
tell everyone, and have the uproar wreck the community?

Facts are neutral too. It does not depend on the message.

You really have laws on the brain, don't you? Lets see. Breaking laws
reduces freedom? This is where you have the wrong end of the stick. Making,
not breaking laws reduces freedom. If our mayor friend above looks at 1
naked minor a week, how does this reduce the freedom of her community? What
about 100? Much less free obviously.

>I do in fact support cryptography for personal security, not least because

Does that personal security extend to encrypting your hard drive? What
makes you different from Ms. Mayor?
