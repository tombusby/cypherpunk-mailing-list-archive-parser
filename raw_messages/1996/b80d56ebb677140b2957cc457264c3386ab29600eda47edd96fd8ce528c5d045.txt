The latter is far closer to the truth.  First off, GPS signals can be faked. 
 In fact, there are commercial boxes sold that generate a full synthetic 
constellation of GPS signals; these boxes are usually intended to simulate 
motion of a vehicle when the GPS unit under test is actually stuck in a 
laboratory or factory floor.  If such a box were connected to an amplifier 
of a few tens or hundreds of milliwatts, it would be possible to park near a 
potential target and deny him service by making it look like his signal came 
from anywhere else around the world.  (Military boxes would detect this 
because of A/S, however.)  

And if you had a receiver at some specific location at 
which you intend to appear to be connected at, it is likely that full data 
describing the motions of the satellites could be supplied to any other 
location on the Internet needing well under 14,400 bps.
