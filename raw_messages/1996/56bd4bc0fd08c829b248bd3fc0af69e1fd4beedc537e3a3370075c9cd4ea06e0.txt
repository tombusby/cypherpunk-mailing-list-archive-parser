Hmmmm.  Last thing I saw, you claimed you put me in your "killfile."  Glad 
to see I'm off.  (This makes me wonder why...)   Hope I don't do anything 
else to offend you. B^)

Hey, you're a sharp guy!  Not too many people are aware of the Mossbauer 
effect.  I'll bet you read the same Scientific American article I did, 
decades ago.  Here's a question:  How hard is 
it to make a gamma detector?  I'd like to experiment with the Mossbauer 
effect, but aside from the difficulty of obtaining the radioactive nuclides, 
I don't know to make a crystal detector.  And is that the best an amateur 
could do?

Yes, yes, yes, I know this stuff.  But my pickiness was based on the fact 
that the term "interact" can vary over many orders of magnitude.  For 
example, as I recall the ratio of the electrical repulsion  between two 
protons exceeds the gravitational attraction by a factor of about 10**40.  I 
just object to the use of the term "interact" in a cavalier way, as if 
quantum mechanical "interaction" was the only kind of interaction that 
"mattered."  (no pun intended...well, maybe just a little.)

Okay, maybe not, but my idea is substantially better than anything I've 
heard published in the open lay press.  I just heard from a friend that even 
that hack Clancy used krytrons and capacitors; my system would use _trivial_ 
components to do the timing.
