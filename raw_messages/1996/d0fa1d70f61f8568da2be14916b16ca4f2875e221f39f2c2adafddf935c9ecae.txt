There goes rec.antiques.radio+phono & rec.radio.swap - many of the 
Trans-Oceanics I have bought on-line would qualify as filthy, ever try 
to remove years of accumulated tobbacco smoke residue from the inside 
of a dial-lens ?

Don't forget rec.radio.shortwave - someone in a non-compliant country might 
transmit someting nasty. 

And as for lascivious - there goes the Tex Avery cartoons on Nickelodeon.

Did Nehimiah (sp?) Scudder come up with this ?

						Warmly,
