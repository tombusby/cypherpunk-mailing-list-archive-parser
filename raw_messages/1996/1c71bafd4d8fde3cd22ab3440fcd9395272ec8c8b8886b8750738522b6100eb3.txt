It has *everything* to do with viruses.  Your program is not a virus
BUT the press release tells the "danger" of trusting your own computer.
If your own computer is doing something other than what the 
software on it is advertised as doing you have a virus, or trojan 
horse like a dirty-picture-viewer-with-keyboard-capture.

Virus's and trojan horses are nothing new.  The detector programs
keep up with them quite nicely and make a good buck doing it.

As for the technical content of the program - I'ld hack up
a DOS version tonight if I thought it was worth my effort
to drag the PC compiler/assembler out of mothballs.  (I don't
do MS-Windows).  A weeks time is more that enough for any 
technically competent programmer to do the capture and add in
the Windoze bells and whistles.

I find that FV's hype on this is nothing but a thin disguise 
for a selling of their product.  Come-on guys.  Sell your
product, not FUD.
