How about as a means of coercing war criminals ethnic purgers, as those in
Bosnia/Serbia, to turn themselves in to proper tribunals for judging.
Having AP bettors wager $100,000s on your untimely retirement, unless you
turn yourself in, could induce one to consider conventional justice.

I find it appalling the duplicity of world government leaders which talk
frequently of world justice but are only prepared to expend real effort to
catch the few terrorists attacking their citizens, while those who commit
genocide on other are given half-hearted slaps of the hand and told not to
sin again, or less through government inaction.

Just think of it as a sportsbook with different games and players.  You
wouldn't accuse bettors of trying to influence the outcome a football game
would you?  :-)

No, I see it as another possible means of encouraging justice in a world
where the largest criminals are often beyond the reach of the world
community due to 'political complications'.

I think AP, or its ilk, may be a likely outcome in a would unable or
unwilling to apply justice even-handedly no matter what a person's station.
It's a popular rebellion to encourage the 'legal' world justice system to
have more backbone and care less about politics or risk being marginalized.

Mathematically verifiable safeguards would need be developed so that this
is minimized or eliminated as a possibility before any sportsbooks, what
ever the sport, operate.  This is a function the community of cypherpunks
and professional crypto and security people should serve.

All human rights are Naturally derived as are the 'Laws of the Jungle'.
Governments instituted among men should derive their rights from the
soverignty of its citizens.  Unfortunately, many countries choose to ignore
this.  AP should serve an occassionally competitive system to keep the
'duly consistuted' system on its toes lest those in authority reap the law
of the jungle.
