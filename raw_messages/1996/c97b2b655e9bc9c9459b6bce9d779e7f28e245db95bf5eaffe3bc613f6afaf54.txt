You seem to be confused. No one suggested that I have any plans to sue
Ray Arachelian. Some of the lies he and Tim May posted to this mailing
list are probably actionable, but I don't believe in suing over something
said on the net.

Ray Arachelian has repeatedly threatened to sue me over my posts to this
mailing list, and that's what his legal fund is for. It is by no means a
legal "defense" fund.

A related question: when persons of Japanese descent (including 3rd generation
U.S. citizens) were rounded up during WW2 and confined to concentration camps,
where many died from deprivation and disease, why weren't persons of Armenian
descent similarly "interned"? Weren't they even more sympathetic to the Nazis
that persons of German descent?
