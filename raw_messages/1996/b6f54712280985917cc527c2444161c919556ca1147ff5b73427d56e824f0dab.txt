I doubt this. This would be too absurd even for the feds...a special font
to be used in books?

As I said, hand-entry of text and code is already very cheap....and any
code fragments desired to be exported can be trivially taken out in any of
the zillions of floppies and disks crossing the borders each day, or the
Net of course (stego, hidden, remailed, whatever).

The whole book thing is an oddity...no meaningful crypto is going to be
helped or hindered by the book exception.

What _could_ conceivably happen is that export of some code fragment could
be given plausible deniability that an export violation occurred by having
a paper version distributed widely. "Honest...we didn't send PGP 3.0 to
Europe! Someone must've OCRed or manually typed in the code we published in
"PGP 3--The Text.""

This strategem would work even if the feds mandated some special
non-OCRable font (which I doubt could exist...if humans can read the font,
so can trainable OCR programs, which of course don't rely on having
libraries of particular fonts).

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
