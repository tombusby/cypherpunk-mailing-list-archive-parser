>   TACOMA, Wash (Oct 2, 1996 00:18 a.m. EDT) -- A year ago, a group of
>   lawyers gathered in Seattle to launch an organization they hoped would
>   help set legal policies for the Internet.
   
>   On Tuesday, that group announced the formal financial support of 21
>   international companies -- from Microsoft to Netscape, from British
>   Telecom to Bell Canada. These companies and the researchers employed
>   by the newly named "Internet Law & Policy Forum," hope to set Internet
>   guidelines for governments and industry on such issues as copyright,
>   content and commerce.
   
[...]

>   This group hopes to help answer those questions and others by
>   researching and pooling policies from governments, companies and legal
>   experts. Then researchers will propose guidelines for others to
>   follow. If companies with such competing interests as AT&T and MCI,
>   and Mastercard and Visa can agree on Internet guidelines, Gidari's
>   group hopes governments will let industry regulate itself, he said
>   Tuesday.
   
>   "It should make government less interested in addressing an issue by a
>   law when they can see people are acting responsibly without it," he
>   said. "It diffuses the need to do something. It's a lot harder to
>   legislate when the problem is being addressed."

	An apparantly good motive... although that self-censorship is no
better than normal censorship is something to consider.

	Anybody at Netscape know much about this third guy? The United
Nations connection of the first one doesn't seem encouraging... the UN is
heavy on national sovreignty and lacking in civil liberties, especially
economic ones.

>   resources of those parties that are helping to drive the Internet
>   forward can be focused to achieve genuine progress in resolving legal
>   and policy issues."
