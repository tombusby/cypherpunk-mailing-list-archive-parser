Who says they were going to blow anything up?  It is perfectly legit for
farms to have large quantities of fertilizer around--they use it all the
time.  Same with diesel fuel--what are they supposed to run the tractors and
combines with?  Dog piss?  DUHHHH!  As far as having the instructions for
mixing them to go boom, who the hell made that a crime?  You could bust most
of the farmers in this country if you criminalize simultaneous posession of
fertilizer and diesel fuel.  Did these people ever actually mix any of the
fert. and fuel together?  Did they threaten to blow up anything?

This whole situation is nothing more than jackbooted thugs getting a rush by
stomping on people.  FTJBT
