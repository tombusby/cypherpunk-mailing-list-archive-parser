	IP addresses are a scarce resource today.  Try getting a /16
allocation (what used to be a class B).  There are politics in the
process already.

	Addresses will not be easily 'transferable.'  The IETF is
discussing a 'Best Current Practices' document that talks about
address portability.  Basically, it can't happen, because the routers
only have so much memory, and the routers at the core of the internet
can't keep in memory how to reach every one; there needs to be
aggregation.  The only feasible aggregation seems to be provider
based, ie, MCI, Alternet, and other large ISPs get blocks of
addresses.  They give them to smaller companies, like got.net, which
gives them to customers.  The result?  The core routers have a few
more years.

	Lastly, 32 bit addressing is going away.  IPv6 offers 128 bit
address space, and (hopefully) much more efficient allocation, as well
as such useful things as hooks for automatic renumbering of address space.
