Well, if the customer does not complain about its inclusion, and chooses to
use it for its simplicity over more secure, "after market" systems, then
thats voluntary.  Thats the same voluntary that means that if the people
don't get out to the polls then they volunteered to keep thier opinions
about how government should be run to themselves.  It will probably be
voluntary, no one tells you that you have to use interNic when using the
internet, but you probably do because it is easier than trying to route
around it to its new competitor (the one issuing URL's ending in .auto and
.bus among others).  No one is telling you to use interNic, no one is
telling you to pay to register with interNic, but it is definately less of a
headache.
