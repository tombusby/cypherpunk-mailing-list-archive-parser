	Umm... I pointed out a while back the considerable problems with
the RSAC attempt at objective ratings. See
http://infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks/dir.archive-96.05.09-96.05.15/0092.html
for a review of my objections. The system in question is obviously
much more subjective than, say, one that had:
	Does this page contain any female frontal nudity?
	Does this page contain any male frontal nudity?
	Does this page contain any female rear nudity?
	Does this page contain any male rear nudity?
and so on. The parts on violence are particularly subjective.
