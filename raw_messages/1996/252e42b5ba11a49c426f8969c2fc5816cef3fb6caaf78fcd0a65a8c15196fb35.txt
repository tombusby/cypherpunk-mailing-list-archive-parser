        This isn't exactly true (as you indicate later). PICS labels can be
incorporated into the html <meta> tag by the content creator, it can be sent
by way of the http server (using the 'get') or it can be collected from a
third party label bureau.

        However, self rating will be a significant use in the future, and it
is the only way PICS is being used effectively today (at RSAC).

        True.

        Two may be quite successfully accomplished using PICS. Europe
(Germany and Nazis) and China/Singapore could make quite effective use of
PICS if they require that all browsers in their country be sold with their
rating (censorship) system included (and if they mandate that government
label bureaus _must_ be used.)

        The reason self-rating is mentioned is to forestall the fear of
mandated/arbitrary third party rating. Rather than some MPAA like system
being imposed by the govt., the self-rating was a better political/strategic
position. Also, self rating scales well until third party label bureaus are
sufficiently developed.
