I guess Ritalin really does work.

I for one don't have any way of estimating how many messages they might
want to read. But note some figures we've discussed here before:

* NSA spent upwards of $100 M to build the "Harvest" machine in the late
50s and early 60s (you worked with Norm Hardy, Bill, so you undoubtedly
know about this). Some of this machine's capacity was for cryptanalysis,
some for voice analysis, and no doubt a lot for other things. But it says
something about the kinds of money that will be spent.

* Spysats routinely cost a billion dollars or more. (A single launch of the
space shuttle costs at least $500 M, as I recall. Some shuttle launches
have been to deploy SIGINT sats.)

* The NSA was one of the main investors in several high tech companies,
including Control Data Corporation and Cray Research.

I conclude, roughly speaking, that spending $100 M on a specialized machine
to break RC4 or any other modern cipher (that is breakable at the key
lengths used) would not even give them pause.

I don't believe that even _they_ would plan for something like this, unless
RC4 is a lot weaker than experts seem to think it is.

But, as many have pointed out, this is not a realistic limit. The pieces of
the solution could be scattered from one end of Fort Meade to another, and
still not be affected much by communications costs and delays. Power
density is thus not going to be a problem. (A calculation can be done on
how long it will take before electricity costs exceed chip costs...I
haven't done this for the crypto FPGAs, as so many things are unclear about
what they might be, but for the 200 MHz Pentium (CPU alone, not a system) I
get: 40 kilowatt-hours per year x $0.10 per KWH = $4 per year in
electricity costs. Heat removal costs are comparable.)

FPGAs and custom chips will not be much different. I conclude that the
costs of building the chips and system will be orders of magnitude more
expensive than the costs of running the chips with power, and that removing
the heat is not an issue. (Spread out enough, simple heat removal a la
office computers is fine. Leaving windows open is even cheaper ;-))

An FPGA is field-programmable. (FPGA = Field Programmable Gate Arrays) The
Xilynx and Altera lines of FPGAs could be reconfigured for other
algorithms, surely. (I recall several preliminary designs discussed in
various places.)

This doesn't mean they've done it, only that they could buy millions of
FPGAs for the cost of a single spysat or shuttle launch. So, it seems
likely.
