You're probably right, for today's factoring techniques.
For a key you're only planning to use for the next couple of years,
you can pretty much ignore strong primes, unless you're stuck with
512-bit keys, in which case you need to glean any crumbs you can.
But for a value that needs to last a long time, such as a 
Diffie-Hellman modulus that's going to be a default value in a standard,
and which you're only going to generate once anyway, it makes sense
to generate a strong prime in case factoring methods that are
affected by it become popular again in the future.  It also makes sense
to turn loose a bunch of people using different primality tests
just in case somebody gets lucky (e.g. crank the test long enough that
the probability of non-primality is 10**-9 or 10**-12 instead of just 10**-6.

Do Generalized Number Field Sieve and its friends count as
elliptic curve methods?
