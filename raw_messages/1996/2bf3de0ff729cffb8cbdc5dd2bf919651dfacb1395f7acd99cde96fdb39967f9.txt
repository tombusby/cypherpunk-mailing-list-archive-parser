Oh, but it is done very, very often. That is, it is not something reserved
for "war criminals" (not that war criminals are excluded, as shown by the
Dayton Accords, and other visits.)

"Denied entry" and "undesirable" are the operative words. The offense may
be writing materials critical of the U.S. (poetry, novels, etc....so far,
not Net stuff). Various flavors of activists, writers, critics, etc. are
often denied visas to enter the U.S.

I don't believe the Net has yet registered on the Richter scale of visa
grantings, but I suspect it will within a couple of years, both because the
Net will become a more important media channel and because it will be so
easy to compile lists of folks who will be denied entrance visas.

(And the same applies in reverse. I have no doubt that I will be denied
visas to enter various countries, including the freedom-loving countries of
the mullahs and sheiks, and that country which sent Pollard to spy on the
U.S. Good thing I don't want to visit any of them, except Iraq.)
