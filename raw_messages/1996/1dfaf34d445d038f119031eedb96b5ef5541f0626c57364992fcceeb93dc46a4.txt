You can try the following.  I will be attempting it myself tonight.  I also 
understand that the 128-bit version is available again.

Good luck!

There is a way to get the production release to run on the beta II of NT. 
It requires a little work but it does run fine.  It seems the only problem
is in the install.  If you follow these steps you can use the install from
the beta if IE 3.0 Beta II on the production cab file and it will install.

1. Run the self extracting cab file for the beta II of IE.  This should
produce a temporary dir in the temp dir on drive c.  You will have to find
it as it is named something different each time.

2. When you run this the first question will be do you want to cont. Answer
yes. When it asks for you to agree to the lic. look for the temp dir. Make
a copy of it somewhere and disagree.

3. Run the Prod code. Agree to the lic. and wait for the prompt for
optional Internet components.  Find the temp dir for this install and make
a copy of it.

4. Run msie.exe from yorur new dir in step 4. This will make a new temp
dir. Find it and make a copy.

5. In the dir made in step 4 you will find a CAB file and a IE.inf file. 
These need to be copied to the dir made in step 2.  REN the ie.inf to
ohrome.inf and run the infinst.exe file. This should install the production
code on your beta II of NT

Good Luck.
