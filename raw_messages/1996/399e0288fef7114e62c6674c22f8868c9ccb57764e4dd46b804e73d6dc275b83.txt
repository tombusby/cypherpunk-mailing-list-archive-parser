Hello Everyone,

	I've created a new type2.list/pubring.mix combination on
jpunix.com. The most notable change is that the q@c2.org has been removed
from the list. After several spot checks over the weekend I noticed the
ncognito remailer producing sporadic pings so I left it on the list. Also,
please note that the middleman remailer has changed nym servers from
alpha.c2.org to nym.jpunix.com. 

	The files are available by WWW at http://www.jpunix.com as well as
by anonymous FTP at ftp.jpunix.com.
