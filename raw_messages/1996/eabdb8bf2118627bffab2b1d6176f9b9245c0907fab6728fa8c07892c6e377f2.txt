The latest version of NOISE.SYS (v0.3.5-Beta) can be gotten
via anonymous ftp at ftp.funet.fi/pub/crypt/random/noise035.zip

NOISE.SYS is a /dev/random driver for DOS systems running on
386 or later processors.  It will sample fast timings between
keystrokes and disk access, as well as changes in mouse position
and CPU-clock drift, mixing with SHA-2 message digest to generate
crypto-quality random numbers.

Added in this version:
  Added documentation!!!
  Fixed timer sampling bug
  Fixed clock drift sampling (better entropy too)
  Added mouse position sampling
  Different accumulation function
  Lots of other changes
