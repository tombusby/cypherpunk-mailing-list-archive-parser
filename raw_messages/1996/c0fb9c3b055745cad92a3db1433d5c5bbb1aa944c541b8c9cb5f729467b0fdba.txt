I'm in the Air Guard and have been for almost 10 years. I work in the 
crypto vault, which is really really boring. but we keep it interesting 
by shreading pieces of cardboard in the outer vault and yelling to my 
chief "...O.K. CHIEF...I'M SHREADING THE PICTURES OF THE CRASH SITE IN 
NEVADA...YOU WANT ME TO SHREAD THEM ALL?"

Anyhow, last summer our material controller got tasked by (I think) the 
OSI to do this emergency audit on this unit's material control section up 
in Washington.  There's these cool safes that we use to store our cryto 
in that look kinda like the ones behind Trey at:

These safes are only build and sold for DOD use; you can't buy them as 
civilians.  At least these specific ones are.
So it turns out that the guy who was in charge of the supplies of this 
unit was selling all kinds of stuff at his garage sales, including some 
of these safes.  This civilian bought a safe and a year or so later it 
stopped working, so he called the phone number on the metal tag thats on 
the safe.  The conversation went like this:

Safe manufacturer:  Hello?
Civilian:  Yeah, I got this safe of yours and its broken.
SM:  What unit are you with?
C:  HUH?
SM:  Who are you?
C:  Look, I don't like your attitude.  What does it matter who I am...who 
    are you?!?  I want this thing fixed.
SM:  Are you with the military?
C:  No, why would I be?
SM:  Can I put you on hold for a second, please don't hang up.

You can guess the rest.  It didn't take them long to figure out what 
happened, and the material control guy who sold the safe cut town. but 
they got him.  At least that's how I heard it.  I hate to relay these 
things second hand, but looking at Trey's picture made me remember it.
