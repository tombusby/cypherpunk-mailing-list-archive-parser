	A related question is about the cover traffic generators. With those,
I've gathered you've got the two choices of loops and nowhere-ending chains
(e.g., directing it to "nobody" on most systems). If it's done using a loop,
is there any way for a procmail script to determine that and toss them into
/dev/null?

	Or a VAX/VMS user; there are, I have been informed, enough
UNIX-specific system calls in Mixmaster that porting it isn't a trivial task.

	What mechanisms are available to make sure it will recover if /tmp
gets deleted? I suspect also that many ISPs might be quite willing not to
bother backing up some directory or another - it saves them time and space.
	Thanks,
