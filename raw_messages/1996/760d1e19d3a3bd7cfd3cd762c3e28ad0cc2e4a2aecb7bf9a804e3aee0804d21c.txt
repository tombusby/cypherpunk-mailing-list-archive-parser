Yes, Mr Tallpaul, I see you are upset by my reply to your threat to have 
me arrested in London and dragged off to New York to face trial for 
having sent messages to this list that found their way to you.  As I 
understand it, the division between the Shiites and Sunnites goes back to 
a dispute in the seventh century between Ali, the son-in-law of Mahomet, 
and Muawiya, the Caliph of the time.  Since then, the Shiites have 
divided and dubdivided into many sects, while the Sunnites have remained 
more or less united.  To this extent, the division within Islam is 
similar to that between Catholics and Protestants - though I wouldn't 
like to draw any comparisons between the doctrinal disputes of Islam and 
Christianity.

As for their respective sizes, estimates vary; but the proportion 
most commonly given between Shiites and Sunnites is 15:85.  If you have 
other figures, doubtless you will post them.

Yes, Mr Tallpaul, I can and will.  You should consult the various 
publications of the Islamic Propagation Centre International, at 481 
Coventry Road, Birmingham, B10 0JS, England, fax - **121 766 8577.  You 
will find enough there to have any sceptic wetting himself with laughter.

In fairness, this is a good point.  I accept that a list that I joined in 
order to read about Phil Zimmerman and pgp is not the best place for 
discussing the horrors of Islam.  I will therefore say no more on the 
subject - not even uploading the review I promised in an earlier 
posting.  I shall return to lurking.

but Mr Tallpaul might persuade his government to do to me what it did to 
General Noriega)
