It seems that one crux of the problem revolves around the CA and its method
of certificate issuance.  A CA which uses biometric data to
reduce/eliminate the chance that an applicant could get several, unrelated,
certificates issued would provide a basis for negative authentication
(similar to a negative credit file).

A one-way function performed, by the client, on their certificate from this
CA would yield a token which unambiguously binds it to a valid certificate
of the CA (and therefore uniquely identifies them) w/o revealing the
certificate itself.
