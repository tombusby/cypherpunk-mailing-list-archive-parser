	Actually, I already may have helped a radical left organization -
namely Radikal - by putting some mirror sites on a lot of search engines.
Quite simply, capitalism works - and it will win out in an unfettered contest.
It's communism and other varieties of authoritarianism that need the
fetters to win. (In the ultimate extreme, I include gun control under the
fetters that communism/etcetera need to win... the "redistribution" from
producers ("rich") to welfare drones ("poor") during the Rodney King riots
would have been nicely prevented by some shopkeepers with automatic weapons.
