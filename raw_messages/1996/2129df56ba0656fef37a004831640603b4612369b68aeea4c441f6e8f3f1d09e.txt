Dear internet users

It seem like we have find an easy way to disseminate our point and thought. Through internet with 
address "beta@...". But some people have abused this privilage by disseminating some rubbish which 
came from their indiscipline brain. I highly appreciate if all internet users do not write any rubbish 
like this and addressed it to "everybody". From my calculation, this rubbish contain 3408 characters, 
(not inclusive blank and control characters). If this type of rubbish is being desseminate to 
everybody, it will occupy more than 13,632 bytes on each machine. Multiply that with number of users. 
It took me several minutes trying to understand what s/he want to deliver, multiple that with number 
of readers. What a waste. 

So to all internet users, I request your kind cooperation:
1	to restrain yourselve from writing rubbish and ask others to read it.
2	if you have to write something to clear your brain, you can either put it on the bulletin 
board or direct it to specific person, such as psychologist, physiotherapist or a doctor. Your mother 
in law is another person you should think of.
3	if you have problem, which you think our fellow users may help, please state your problem 
clearly, and short.
4	please understand that internet users come from variety backgrounds. What is right for you, 
may be just a rubbish for others and it can cause unnecessary wastage of resources.


"If you don't have any valuable to say, keep quiet".
