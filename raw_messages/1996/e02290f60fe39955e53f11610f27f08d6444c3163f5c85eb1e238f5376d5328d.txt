	Thanks.
	Incidentally, one thing that I noticed in your listing of services
was email to fax. In some circumstances (such as anonymous accounts), the other
way around would be useful. Even for a non-anonymous account, there have been
times when I've wished I could give someone a FAX number and have it emailed.
Admittedly, there is the problem of optical character recognition et al;
perhaps this could be handled via temporary web pages with a password emailed
to an account on the same system? Sameer may also want to look into this.
	I've seen some information about such systems on the net; one in
New York appears to include voicemail to email services, although I don't know
how as yet.
	-Allen
