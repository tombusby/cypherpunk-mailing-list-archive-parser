You bring up a point that is implied - but not explicit - in the article.
And it's a good one. Funny thing is, two of the _industry_ folks suggested
individuals probably needed to be included in the document more than they
were. Neither was keen on being quoted on the record regarding non-business
interests, of course.

Given the attitude of the folks I talked to, I suspect non-business
interests are still fairly important to the White House on this one. 

And remember: Ira Magaziner won no friends in industry with his health care
proposals a couple of years back; some folks think he's leaning in favor of
industry at least initially to make sure what happened then doesn't happen
again.

If Netizens find suggestions from the administration too heavy-handed, my
guess is there's still time to move the discussion.

Cheers.
