The original definition of multiple transactions (structuring) said the
transactions had to occur within one day.  There is now a separate rule that
says that the bank has to report *any* suspicious transactions even if they
don't fall under specific regulations.  Keep the population guessing as to
what's reportable.

New York money center banks allow $1000 a day or so.  Credit cards (which
are also bank accounts although most don't think of them as such) let more
get out and one can always over pay one's credit card to get a credit
balance of any amount.  They take the money.  Usually in those cases, you
can withdraw the credit limit each day and then when the account settles
overnight it draws down the credit balance you've built up and your
available credit is back.  Some may do this "live" one would have to
experiment.  

ATM and credit cards may also have different limits for point-of-sale
transactions than for cash withdrawals.

You have to report taking cash (currency or monetary instruments) into or
out of the country but you don't have to rat on yourself for cash
transactions with a bank here.
