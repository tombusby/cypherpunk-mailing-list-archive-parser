oh mindless aga,

Certainly not in your case.

>who call themselves "punks."

If you are ignorant of them, then how do you know that they are "stupid"?

>Look asshole; it says "LAW DOCTOR" -- that is what "Juris Doctor"
>means, stupid.  And I am about to stick the motherfucking Laws
>right up your cocksucking ASS!

How is this possible? It seems that you are possible of rather contemptible contortions!


>"Juris" means Law.  So Juris Doctor means "Law Doctor."

Clinging to technicalities here, aren't we?

>that is irrelevant, and you are off-topic.

Oooh! Oooh! Point the finger here, aga, at YOURSELF!

>Europe is also irrelevant, and you keep missing the point here.
>You have added the cypherpunks list again, and that was forbidden.

What a wonderful statement: Europe is irrelevant!!! A truly educated mind here. 

>look asshole, you really want that list killed, do you not?
>I have no bounds, as you will soon learn.

When one is clapped in irons and thrown into prison for whatever it is that your acts can be classified under, then I am pretty sure they have _some_ bounds.

>> > > Be careful who you threaten.  It might get you in trouble.

One wonders if you ever pay attention to what you actually write, aga?

>WRONG!  There is NO crime which covers anything that one does
>internationally!   And mailbombing is NOT "Unauthorized access,"
>regardless of where it occurs!

Uhm...oops, aga, you're wrong here, there are plenty of crimes that are international crimes. War crimes for example, which o against the Geneva convention. Child abduction crimes, which go against the Hague convention. But I am sure they will give you a slight slap on the  wrist, after all, you are only a stupid hillbilly with no idea of the law.

You seem to have this absolute _fascination_ with asses, faggots, cocks, and ripping _new_ assholes (as if you weren't a big enough one already. This is obviously some sort of concious repression: you just can't face the truth, can you, aga?

Do we run and hide now, mommy?

He/she/it pumps iron, does he/she/it? Whilst running? No mean feat for a thing without a brain. Assuming that you are better than anyone else you have probably never met, someone who probably has no desire to meet a thing like yourself, is yet another example of your sheer assonance!

>And just understand, as far as the internet is concerned, Europe does
>not mean SHIT!

Of course not...I am sure the European Internet thinks the same as you. After all, an inanimate object seems to think just as much as you!
