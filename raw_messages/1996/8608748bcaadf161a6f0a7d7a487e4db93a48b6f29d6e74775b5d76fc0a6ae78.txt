(Apparently the Poles are seeking tools for controlling the economic
transactions of its citizen-units. Thanks to Bob for forwarding this to us.
I am copying Andrzej Adamski on my response.)

Yes, the Cypherpunks mailing list (send a request as described below) has
software to defeat methods of tracking money-laundering. In particular,
anonymous remailers, unbreakable cryptography, offshore data havens,
digital cash, information markets, and a large body of thought about
methods to defeat attempts by Central States to control and track the
economic transactions of individuals and corporations.

I realize our Polish correspondent may be seeking tools to _assist_ the
Police of his country in stopping his countrymen from moving funds around
without the approval and control of the apparatchniks who control such
things in command economies, but I think he needs to know just how hopeless
the task really is.

The Polish state will crumble, though it may take a couple of generations.
