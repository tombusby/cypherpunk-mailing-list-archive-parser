The reason the message is not resendable is that the remailers keeps track
of the serial number of that header. If forced, the log of serial numbers
could be deleted, and the operator would process the message.

Unless you are assuming some key archived by each remailer for the reply
block, then I think it will be possible to repair the chain.
