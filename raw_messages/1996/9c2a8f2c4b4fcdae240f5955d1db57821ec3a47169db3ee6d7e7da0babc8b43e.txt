Black Unicorn is absolutely correct that this is generally the law.
Jim Bell is absolutely correct that laws like this are offensive and outrageous.
Unfortunately, Jim then rants at Unicorn for suggesting that this
would be the case; you'd think he'd be the first to realize that
there are laws out there that are offensive and outrageous and enforced.

Now that's an interesting wrinkle to the problem.  I suspect that,
as you suggest, there will be ISPs, especially in non-US jurisdictions,
that are willing to send out "Rosebud" messages to anonymous remailers,
or to fail to send "Remarque" messages, or to debit anonymous accounts
for data retrieval services rendered while also supporting billing-status
checking by anonymous remailers.  From a crypto-anarchist dogmatic perspective,
it'll definitely happen, though there may be a rough transition until
there's enough critical mass to make it undetectable (and note that
"undetectable" is a tougher standard than "untraceable"...)
