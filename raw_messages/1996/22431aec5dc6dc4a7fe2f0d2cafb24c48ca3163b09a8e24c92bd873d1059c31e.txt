Today Concentric Network Corp. won an injunction [15] against Cyber Pro-
motions, Inc. -- the outfit against which AOL lost a court fight to keep
its subscribers free of email spam -- see TBTF for 9/8/96 [16]. Cyber
Promotions, it seems, was forging a Concentric Network return address in
their spams, so thousands of outraged Netizens bombarded the ISP daily
with demands that Concentric stop supporting an activity that is, in fact,
forbidden by their terms of service and of which Concentric was entirely
innocent. The wording of the promise that Cyber Promotions was compelled
to sign forbids them specifically from thus abusing Concentric in the
future. It seems to me that the spammer will be free to choose another
ISP "goat," or to forge a nonexistent return address on their future
spams, without penalty. This timely news just arrived on Glen McCready's
<glen@qnx.com> "0xdeadbeef" mailing list.
