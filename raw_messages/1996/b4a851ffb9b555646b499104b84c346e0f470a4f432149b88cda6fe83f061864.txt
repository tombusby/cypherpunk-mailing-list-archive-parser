        It's important to distinguish between information that you've voluntarily released as such (e.g., giving someone your SSN) and information derived from analysis of your actions (e.g., repayment patterns, value-added with a proprietary scoring system) and/or consolidated from small releases of info here and there--and most of the material in a typical TRW or Equifax dossier is of the latter kind.
        ObCrypto? Vaguely. I've been thinking about the possibilities of "bullshit generators"--simple programs that would generate names and various kinds of facts about people who don't exist and "make this info available": email addresses to SSNs, addresses, credit histories, medical records, you name it. If "bullshit bots" became generally available and easy to implement, "information markets"--a phrase that's far too general to capture the complexity of the dynamics it refers to--would stratify pretty fast: groundfeeders like the fine folks who're now grepping newsfeeds for email addresses + interests could be laid waste to pretty fast by a handful of dormant newsgroups systematically flooded with posts from gjhfkj@opihk.com or poipoh@axsx.org. Who'd pay for a DB that's half bogus? Alternatively: who'd pay to prevent their DB from being corrupted? Companies like Equifax would be harder to penetrate, but by no means beyond reach: there are so many people out there who they don't have files on yet--in ghettoes, in Eastern Europe--that they could be duped. We tend to think of information markets as markets for _true_ information; but as those markets mature, they'll breed parallel "counterweight" markets--markets, in essence, for _false_ information. Equifax and TRW got the goods on you? How much would you pay to vanish into a crowd of newly created people with excellent credit ratings who are all just a few diddled digits away from you, your SSN, your address, your phone number, your mother's maiden name...? The latest issue of RISKS (2/8/96, 17:70) has a kvetch about <http://www.graviton.com/red/>, "The Red Herring Home Page":

        Congress would be hard pressed to illegalize fiction.
