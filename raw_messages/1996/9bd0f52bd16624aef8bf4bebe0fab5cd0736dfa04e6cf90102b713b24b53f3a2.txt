I can agree with this.

I agree here too.  I've been stupid many times, but 
I never expect to see a fair random number 
generator produce Hamlet.  (I should live so long!)

And I could agree with this too, except that cryptanalysts do not 
consider every string to be equally likely.  If they did, they would 
never even bother to look at XORing a bitstream with ciphertext to 
produce plaintext.

This is true.  But it is also unavoidable.  Actually, I'm pleased to give 
up one-percent of my keyspace, if that's the one-percent that an analyst 
will check first.

Another example: What if I selected a nonsense passphrase, 
"Dagmar shaved Howard's cocker spaniel"  Not great, but adequate for my needs.
If, by some wild coindence, a book by that title became a best seller, I would 
change my passphrase.  A cryptanalyst who knew that was my feeling could
simplify 
his cracking by not bothering to search for best selling book titles.  On
the other 
hand, a cryptanalyst who was not so convinced of my paranoia, and who DID check 
book titles, would not find my passphrase.  I assume that BOTH philosophies 
would be used in a serious attack.  When I do the math, it says that, assuming 
BOTH types of attack are done, it is better to have a passphrase that is not 
the title of a book.

Agreed.  And if that produces a "weak key" for your cipher, you'll get broken.

I agree here too.  But the analyst doesn't see the infinite sequence, 
only the number itself.

I am enjoying this discussion, but I feel like I'm running out of 
useful new ways to try to express this idea.  If I don't reply, 
it doesn't mean you have convinced me. :)
