   On small boxes, John Dvorak in Jan 23 PC Mag:

   "Other Things of Interest Dept: Virtual I-0, the Seattle
   company that brings you those nifty 3-D LCD eye-glasses,
   was showing [at Comdex] a complete hard disk-based computer
   the size of a beta video cassette. The idea was that you
   could plug in a keyboard and the video headset and finally
   have that computer-without-a-screen concept that we've been
   promised. Perfect for someone wanting genuine privacy,
   although I think once we start seeing a plane load of
   people all wearing virtual reality headsets, the world
   becomes a little creepier.

   Most Interesting Rumor Dept: Supposedly, Microsoft is
   quietly wooing Hitachi and has secretly ported Windows 95
   to the Hitachi 32-bit RISC processor. It hopes to have
   Casio build and market a small RISC computer about half the
   size of the Newton in an attempt to open up the market for
   those little hand-held, do-all gizmos that seem to be
   attracting a lot of attention in Japan. This is being
   developed by the same group who did the Timex/Microsoft
   watch, I'm told. When I pressed on whether this will really
   be Windows 95 or Windows NT with a Windows 95 shell, I was
   told it will be plain-vanilla Windows 95 stripped down to
   fit on a smaller platform. If Microsoft ports plain Windows
   95 to other chips, this will not sit well with Intel.

   Maybe this thing is the wallet computer that Gates keeps
   mumbling about in his more recent speeches."
