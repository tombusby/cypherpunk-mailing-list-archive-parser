  Government, Cryptography, and the Right to Privacy
  J.Shearer, P.Gutmann
 
  The notion of a right to privacy of citizens in their communications is
  discussed in the context of an international movement by governments towards
  regulation of cryptography, and consideration of key forfeiture systems in
  national cryptography use.  The authors argue that the right to privacy in
  communications networks is an issue of major importance, assuring freedom of
  the individual in national and global communications.  Regulation and control
  of cryptography use on the Internet by national governments may lead to an
  imbalance in the citizen/government power relationship, with sequelae
  including unprecedented surveillance of citizens, disruption of international
  commerce due to lack of powerful cryptography (and lack of standardisation),
  human rights abuses by less democratic or non-democratic governments, and
  limiting of the political potential of an Internet global political system.
