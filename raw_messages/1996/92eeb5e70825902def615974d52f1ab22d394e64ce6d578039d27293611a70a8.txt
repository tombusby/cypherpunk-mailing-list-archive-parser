This project is based on "soft home" or "multi-homing"
on web servers with the use of only one ip number.

any number of names can be mapped to a single ip number.

the server delivers the web page associated with the name
that the server answers to, i.e.

http://black.hole               returns the black.hole page
http://switchboard.black.hole   returns the black.hole link page
http://project.black.hole       returns the black.hole link generator page

The black.hole is an example of content-routing possible
with the name.space naming system.
