It's worse than this.  I can recall talk of a big problem WITHIN INTEL 
trying to tranfer the process to produce a part between (as I recall) two 
Intel semiconductor fabs,  Fab IV and Fab V, which are buildings only a 
couple hundred feet apart!  And obviously, this was done with the full 
cooperation of everyone within Intel, and did not require the interfacing 
with any other company.  The idea that you can just steal the "plans" for a 
chip and build it yourself is crazy.

I was even more disgusted with the FBI:  I kept hearing them claim, "We did 
not authorize him to break the law."   Huh?!?  Maybe they didn't, this time, 
but does this mean, implicitly, that this country has sunk so low that the 
FBI thinks it has the legal authority to "authorize" somebody to break the 
law?????
