I agree with the Professor (although as a native Floridian, I dispute
his .sig about it being warm here!:)) but AFAIK, and unless there are
court orders to the contrary, members of the jury may speak freely
*after* dismissal from grand jury duty. Our problem is finding them
(which shouldn't be *too* hard, given the technology we have). IMO,
after the jury is dismissed we must _not_ contact them directly, but
rather make it clear that we would be happy if they were to contact
us. Hopefully, one of our journalist-types could manage this without
yet-another article giving out the <cypherpunks@toad.com> address.
Presumably, grand-jurors who have carefully followed the court's
instructions would have a bit of catch-up reading on the subject
to do, thus giving us an opportunity for indirect contact with them.
I don't think that this would be illegal, but best to check with a
real-lawyer, and perhaps research the issue a bit, since PRZ's case
(supposedly) has "national security" overtones which could possibly
cause a court to want to hush things.
