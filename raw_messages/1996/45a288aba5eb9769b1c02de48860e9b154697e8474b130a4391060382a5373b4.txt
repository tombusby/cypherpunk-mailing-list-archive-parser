I wrote something which you might be confusing for this argument; in case
this is what you mean, I've reproduced it below:

Also, there is an important difference between making a policy argument or
expressing a preference, e.g.:

"I like having a choice between disclosing information which is requested
and suffering the penalties for contempt of court"

and an argument about the constitution:

"The constitution says I must be given a choice between disclosing and
contempt." 

I don't remember seeing any examples of the latter come across the list. As
I remember things, the context of my statement above was a discussion of
why third-party key escrow is not the same as self-escrow.

It's rarely quoted here because it is unremarkable; just as the list is not
a place for basic crypto education, it is not a place for basic legal
education. It's difficult to come up with a good summary of legal issues or
subjects which is readable by lay people and short and accurate (esp. given
that it will be interpreted by lay people in potentially 51 domestic
jurisdictions, plus foreign folks).

Good, fast, cheap, pick any two. 

As Brian Davis and Uni have pointed out, people who keep current enough on
legal topics to be able to give you a good answer will probably want to get
paid for doing so. Saying "here's a legal argument that I made up in the
shower. what do you guys think of it?" and expecting a detailed explanation
of why it's good or bad is the same as saying "here's my new crypto
algorithm that I thought of in the shower, what do you guys think of it?".

Merely asking the question "Is there case law on wiretaps?" suggests that
an answer which includes references will be wasted on you. It will probably
be wasted because your level of interest doesn't seem to have spurred you
to darken the doorstep of a library or bookstore yet; so an answer which
requires you to do so seems unhelpful. It will also probably be wasted
because if you don't already know that there's caselaw about it you
probably don't have enough legal background to place whatever new
information you might get from those references in a useful conceptual
framework. 

But perhaps my speculation is wrong and you are prepared to follow up
meaningfully on references, so ..

Go to a law library or larger general library and ask the librarian to show
you where the annotated copy of 18 USC 2510 is. Read the statute. Read the
legislative history. Read the annotations. Read the cases which were
annotated. Repeat this process until you reach 18 USC 2709 or die of boredom.

Ask the librarian to help you find LaFave's treatises on search & seizure.
Read them.

(The answer to most of the "how do I find out about 'X'?" questions is to
make friends with a librarian who doesn't mind helping you out, just like
with research questions in other fields you may not be familiar with. But
surely it's not possible to get much beyond the age of 12 or so and not
know that ..?)

Try "Understanding Criminal Procedure" by Dressler (Matthew Bender, 1991),
and "Criminal Law" by LaFave & Scott (West). 

(For extra credit, ask for the USCA/USCS annotated copy of the Fourth
Amendment, and read those annotations and cases.)

If there's a law school near you, you might go to the school's bookstore
and look for books in the "Nutshell" series, or the "Emanuel's" series, or
the hardbound hornbooks. These books are mostly used by law students to get
an overview of a particular area of the law. They are not especially
detailed nor up-to-the-minute current but usually aren't totally wrong.
They also don't usually touch on a particular state's law, but discuss
either federal law or an amalgam of state law, so they aren't good for
solving a particular concrete problem. But they will help you figure out
that, e.g., wiretaps have been legal for at least 60-70 years.

Now that you've got some references to work with, please write back and
tell us what you learned. 

(Dorothy Denning & others have written a summary of wiretap procedure which
I don't have time/energy to check for correctness - but it's at 
<http://www.cpsr.org/cpsr/privacy/communications/wiretap/denning_wiretap_pro
cedure_paper.txt>. EFF and CPSR both seem to have some wiretap/privacy
materials available.)
