I'd like to hear what everyone knows about security holes in bank
machines.  I don't believe in that little bank machine cracker they used
in Terminator 2, but I'm interested in the algorithms and protocols the
ABM uses to communicate w/ the home bank.  My bank says they have some
special chip inside the ABM to secure the transfer, and that's all they
told me.  

I also heard that the magnetic stripe on the back contains your card
number (the shiny metallized numbers on the front) encrypted using DES
using your PIN as the key.  Way out to lunch?  Too close for comfort?  Any
knowledge...heck, even rumors.... would be appreciated.  That way we can
see what kind of FUD is out there.  My bet is that the magstrip with DES'd
card number on it theory is FUD.  But my bank did say that there were some
fraudulent transfers (read successful hits) in Europe.  I bank with Alberta
Treasury Branches, and they said their hardware is immune to the attack
that was performed in Europe.... I will have to dig a bit on that one.

Anyway, I hope I hear something from all of you soon...
