Eric Hughes, well known cypherpunk, presented a two-part paper at DEFCON
IV.  The first part of the paper, entitled the "Universal Piracy System" or
UPS, addresses an Internet/Web file system which offers universal access
and privacy. The second part addresses how the UPS can be the enabler for
the demise of copyright while offering a market driven replacement of an
entirely different character.  I hear Eric is refining these ideas and we
hope to see something published soon.

Perhaps he's lurking and will respond.
