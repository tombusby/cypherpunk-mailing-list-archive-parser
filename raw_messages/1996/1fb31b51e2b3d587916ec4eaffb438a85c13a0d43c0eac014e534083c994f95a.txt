I double-checked, and it is Potter Stewart from that case.  Here's the
whole paragraph:

"But in the cases before us, we are asked neither to construe specific
regulations nor to apply specific laws. We are asked, instead, to perform a
function that the Constitution gave to the Executive, not the Judiciary. We
are asked, quite simply, to prevent the publication by two newspapers of
material that the Executive Branch insists should not, in the national
interest, bepublished. I am convinced that the Executive is correct with
respect to some of the documents involved. But I cannot say that disclosure
of any of them will surely result in direct, immediate, and irreparable
damage to our Nation or its people. That being so, there can under the
First Amendment be but one judicial resolution of the issues before us. I
join the judgments of the Court."

Interestingly, Stewart says earlier:

"I should suppose that moral, political, and practical considerations would
dictate that a very first principle of that wisdom would be an insistence
upon avoiding secrecy for its own sake. For when everything is classified,
then nothing is classified, and the system becomes one to be disregarded by
the cynical or the careless, and to be manipulated by those intent on
self-protection or self-promotion. I should suppose, in short, that the
hallmark of a truly effective internal security system would be the maximum
possible disclosure, recognizing that secrecy can best be preserved only
when credibility is truly maintained."

This is the beauty of Patel's earlier ruling.  The fact that we are
possibly talking about speech places a much stronger burden on the gov to
restrict it.

Anyone who was at the hearing on Friday heard some form of the word
"function" repeated many times.  This definitely seems to be the heart of
the gov's argument.  I think it's not gonna float, but IANAL, either :)
