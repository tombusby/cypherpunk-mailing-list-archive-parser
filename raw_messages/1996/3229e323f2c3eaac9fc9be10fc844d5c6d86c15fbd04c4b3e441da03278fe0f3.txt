No, I meant "brutal."

The word "brutal" is also clearly appropriate for Sendero, but I figured 
"bizarre Maoist cult" was sufficiently non-laudatory. I guess some people 
are into that kind of thing, though, so I'll add "brutal" in the future.

Eye for an eye. Thankfully, it's calmed down now that the most nasty folks
are either dead or educated by the experience. Peru moved on from
terrorism to the soap opera within the Fujimori family (his wife
threatened to run for President against him, was locked out of the house,
etc.)

Read anything from Mario Vargas Llosa for background. I'm told that his
novels are actually more accurate than his nonfiction because he doesn't
have to worry quite so much about specific people on both sides wanting to
kill him, since he doesn't name names. I've recommended La vida de
Alejandro Mayta to many a chardonnay revolutionary who thinks that Maoist
revolution is "cool," and the human reality check is good for those with 
a more authoritarian bent, too.
