    come on, David. stated and "real" use are often quite different.
    I meant what I said, literally: "...been there, done that."

    it's nice to believe that governments are above board --they never
    have been, and never will be --and Bubba is a prime example.  I
    would buy a used car from Tricky Dick long before I would from Bubba!

    power is not only corruption, it is _deceit_!

    BTW, I do not disagree with your "protocol" in the slightest. PNG,
    and the trading of PNGs has been around ever since the French seemed
    to their language dominate foreign affairs --however, persona non
    gratis is rather explicit.

    and, I still wonder how the host country will treat "bogus" DPs 
    from rogue states if they have more DPs than real citizens. uncle
    has been getting less suble these days....
