Personally I would like to see the cracking app written in assembly or
optimized C.  Something that will reduce the search time even farther.
(Everyone talks about the hardware, but inefficient software will cost just
as much time as slow hardware.  Not to mention flaky hardware, as is seen
sometimes with gold lead simms and tin lead sockets. [Personal gripe.  I
have been tracking down system problems for a couple of months involving
just this issue. Damn agrivating!])

No matter WHAT is done, they will get some "expert" claming that there is
some flaw in the methodology.  Given enogh attention, those people will look
like hired spin doctors and be pretty much ignored and/or laughed at.
