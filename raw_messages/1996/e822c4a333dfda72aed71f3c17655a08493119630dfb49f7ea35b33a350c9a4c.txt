"Steganography" is the art and science of making information
disappear.
If you don't know where it is, you won't even know it exists.  If you
can't find it, you can't censor it.

Dr. Wayner will explore some of the basic ways that people are hiding
information by making it look like something else; such as innocent
ramblings or flames from a newsgroup or background noise in a
digitized
image or sound file.

Dr. Peter Wayner has a Ph.D. in Computer Science.  He has worked at
Xerox PARC and consulted widely on various topics, including computer
security.  His writing has appeared in popular fora like "BYTE"
magazine
and the "New York Times".  He is the author of "Agents Unleashed: A
Public Domain Look at Agent Technology" and "Digital Cash: Commerce on

the Net" and "Disappearing Cryptography".
