The latest version of ssh has something named "arcfour, which is a
cipher based on a usenet posting in Spring-1995.  It is widely
believed and has been tested to be equivalent with RC4.  (RC4 is a
trademark of RSA Data Security."

This cipher was added when the RC4 support was removed.

Wink, wink.
