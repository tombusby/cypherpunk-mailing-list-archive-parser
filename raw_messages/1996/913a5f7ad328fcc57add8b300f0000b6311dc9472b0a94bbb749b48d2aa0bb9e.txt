Did someone say "deranged"? ;)

If you're involved in the crack trade, chances are low level dealers
are supporting your habit.  Crack tends to make people deranged, and
the pressure of the competition and illegality don't do much for one's
paranoia.

The character who shoots his boss at Micky D's may well be speeded out
or coked up too.  The drugs tends to make one muy loco.

Then again, people don't see much wrong with executing criminals or
going into another country and killing off the civillians because their
petty dictator president would suck the cocks of US/European corporations
so what do you expect?  The derangement is pretty widespread in America.
You got Waco wackos hiding from black helicopters enforcing the Zionist
conspiracy to make Amerikkka part of the one-world government run by
a cabal of Jewish lesbians from the Andromeda galaxy.

I think the crackheads shooting each other on street corners are quite
down to earth in comparison.
