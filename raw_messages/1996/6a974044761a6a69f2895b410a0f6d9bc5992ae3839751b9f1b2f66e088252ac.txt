Lucky, are you just the cynic's cynic, a farther-gone 
revolutionary than you seem, or did you just have a bad month?

Prepare to see "felony Internet access" on the books before long.

Nothing new here. Pornography and the other Three Horsemen will 
be use to ban the spread of 'dangerous' thoughts on the Internet. 
This was clear years ago. Let me emphasize a few facts:

o Non-GAK Encryption will be outlawed.
o 'Immoral' texts and pictures will be banned.
o The dissemination of 'dangerous ideas' will become a felony.

At best, Cypherpunks can hope to provide the infrastructure that 
will allow an underground to communicate semi-securely. We are 
unable to stop the global tidal wave of fascism. Let's not waste 
our time on bemoaning the freedoms crushed in its path. We have 
more important work to do.

But how many of them will be willing to forward certain 
newsgroups if doing so carries a mandatory 10 year prison term? 
Hint: count the number of narcotics dealers that advertize in 
your local yellow pages.

Some site in physical space has to host the nntpd, the ftpd, and 
the httpd. That site will be subject to search, seizure, and 
arrest and conviction of owner.

o Outer space: not very realistic
o Offshore boats: see the fate of drug trafficers in   
  international waters after the Coast Guard is through with 
  them.
o Stable dictatorships: Not stable enough to withstand an 
  humanitarian mission by the US Army.

Wrong. Only 0.03% of the home PCs have to be seized and the 
owners incarcerated. The remaining users will cease to carry 
controlled data on their own.

- ----------

Seems to me that the laws are becomming unified on a global 
scale. The people in power all over the world have the same 
interests. To stay in power. The 'unregulated' Internet is in 
direct confilict with this interest. Since these powers make the 
laws, they will use the laws to reduce the threat the present day 
Internet presents.

Will C2 carry certain newsgroups/info after doing so has become a 
felony? Who wants to be an 'illegal data' kingpin and face 
execution? (Kingpins are 'data trafficers' that carry more than 
1.5 Megs of 'controlled information'.)

That is called a conspiracy. The consequence is that all machines 
involved will be confiscated and their respective owners jailed.

- ----------

Well, you can seize the machine running the OS for the crimes it 
committed. I am serious. No prosecution needed.

- ----------

Prosecution followed by conviction is what will happen to the 
owner of the computer on which the OS was running.

- ----------

Time to bring up my favorite CP invention of the last years: Wai 
Dai's Pipenet. Of course running Pipenet would be a felony in the 
future I forsee, but it sure is a great idea.

- ----------

Pretty hard. That's why the corporate officers will be jailed 
instead. Not that this would be necessary to stop the corporation 
from operating.  The authorities can just confiscating all the 
equipment and thereby put the corporation out of business. Saves 
time and trial costs. They just haul off the computers and 
declare that they are now property of the government.

- ----------

Only to have the box impounded within a few days after going 
on-line. A very costly and likely short lived hobby.

- ----------

All participants in this network are clearly guilty of 
conspiracy. Their assets will be confiscated under RICO. As Brian 
mentioned, the law enforcement agencies are creating a surplus by 
such seizures. The costs associated with more prosecutions are 
more than offset by the revenue generated. Your computer will 
make a welcome addition to their budget. 

- ----------

Inevitably, a DC net or the Token Ring approach described earlier 
will be used for illegal purposes. Once, not if, that comes to 
pass all participants will be guilty of conspiracy and their 
property subject to forfeiture. No trial needed and it will 
happen to the applause of the general public.

========================================

The answer to much of what you write off without a fight is 
fairly obvious, but not yet being mentioned in open conversation.
Without intending this to be a flame, I'd respectfully suggest 
that giving up the living room and den in the hope of a back- 
bedroom campaign against a home invader is probably not a 
workable strategy (if you'll allow a metaphor uncomfortably 
close to the subject matter).

One rule of these types of things is to carry the battle to the 
opponent's ground. Allowing the battle on your own ground is 
hard on the furniture.
