A biocryptoanarchy link to Adleman's DNA work?

   "Bioinformatics: the jobs of the future." 
 
      One of the biggest manpower shortages today is in 
      bioinformatics, the area in which biology meets computer 
      science. Biology is becoming a data-intensive science, 
      in the same way that physics did almost 50 years ago 
      when it became clear that computers would be needed not 
      only to store information but also to process it. 
      There's a great shortage of people, partly because a 
      lot of organisations are simultaneously seeing the need 
      for bioinformatics and partly because the skills 
      required are changing so fast:  
 
      + Search and analysis, including new mathematical 
      techniques for finding patterns in data; 
 
      + Knowledge management, including ways to integrate 
      information from different databases; 
 
      + Mapping and genomics, including approaches to 
      identifying the genetic components of complex traits; 
 
      + Sequence/structure/function including rapid methods to 
      predict the biological function of a gene from its DNA. 
 
      The mainstream computer and information technology 
      companies are only just beginning to take an interest in 
      bioinformatics. "There's a huge vacuum there." For an 
      undergraduate scientist searching for a field in which 
      to specialise, there are no better job prospects than 
      bioinformatics or - cheminformatics.
