Agreed.  I just supposed there might be some of the involved entities 
that are not totally anonymous.  I don't think that you'd deliver 
completely anonymously a bulldozer or any other physical goods to 
some "anonymous" address.  Somehow, if the transaction involves 
anything physical, there is potential for a anonimity breach.

Agreed too.  But still, it might attract troublemakers.

Since I am not a layer, would you care to elaborate a bit more on 
that?

Why?  Don't they already do that through Tax on Capital?

Nobody.  I thought that through you long law studies, you did learn
to read... Or is it my english that is too imperfect?

Dear Unicorn, what in the hell makes you concludes that my
"disclaimer" means that I am going to kill somebody?  I just say that
after having turned the idea around for some time, I see it as
ineluctable that *some* groups will implement it.  Just bring me
*one* single fact of reality that will show me that it is not
possible to implement and you will have made my day.  Even if it is
implemented for any entirely wrong reason, I do not think that we
can prevent it's implementation.

BTW, since I was off from CPunks for a while, would you please tell 
me if you published the suite of you writings on assets concealement?
I would then proceed to get it from the archives if it was published.

Regards.
