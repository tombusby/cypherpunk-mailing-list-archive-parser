But, Sasha, this is the Cypherpunks list...

Seriously, several years ago I started hearing the hype and hoopla about
"Bionomics." Following the book, the conference. Then the seminars, the
training packages, and perhaps even the cult. The book didn't seem to say
anything new, except that markets and various other systems share some
emergent commonalities.

What made me think of it as a cult is when the groupies joined, the staff
was hired, and the publicity campaign began. "The Bionomics Institute"?

But who am I to question EST^H^H^Hbionomics?

Personally, I have accepted Eric Drexler as my personal savior in the Churh
of the Assembler Multitude.
