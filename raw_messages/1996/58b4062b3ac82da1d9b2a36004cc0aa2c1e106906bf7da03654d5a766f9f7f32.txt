Hmm, I've got this a few times from people and I just wanted to clear
up a few points.
1) BSD dd doesn't treat EOT specially:
   /* ... If a partial write, and it's a character device, just warn.
          If a tape device, quit. ... */
   GNU dd (from what I remember) doesn't, either.
2) "dd" will only work safely across all tape types and all size pipes
   using the degenerate form "dd ibs=1 obs=(your_bf_here) conv=sync ...".

I'll hack up catblock today.  Who says we don't code :)
