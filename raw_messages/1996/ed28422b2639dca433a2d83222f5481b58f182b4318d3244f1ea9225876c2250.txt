	I would note that most unions are mostly run by populists of
various varieties, who are generally against individual liberties - whether
liberal or conservative populist doesn't make any real difference in the
long run. To me, Pat Buchannan and Adolf Hitler look rather similar.

	I object to union members getting beaten up for union membership,
striking, etcetera, just as much as I object to members of any other
non-governmental organization being beaten activity. But there's a
difference between the right not to get beaten up and someone claiming that
union membership - still less not working - isn't a perfectly legitimate
reason for firing someone. The state should not be interfering in this
matter, in either direction.

	Quite.... but unions that survive under a free market will look a
_lot_ different from today's unions.
