San Diego Area CPUNKS symposium  Thursday, Oct. 3, 1996.

   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at "The Mission
Cafe & Coffee Shop".  We discuss cryptography and other related subjects, have
the special cypherpunk dinner, and unwind after a long day at the grind stone.

   Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint.  If you can figure out
how to get it on the back of a business card, that would be cool.  If you want
the suspicious crowd there to sign your key, bring two forms of ID.

   Michelle is going to bring her PGP fingerprint in for signature.  Can you
believe it?

   Hopefully Lance Cottrell will give us an update on Mixmaster and what's going
on at San Diego's best ISP.  

   You can also get the scoop on the latest development of my job situation
(hint, some people are getting free eats from me on Thurs).  

   
Place: The Mission Cafe & Coffee Shop
       3795 Mission Bl in Mission Beach.
       488-9060


Time:1800

Their Directions:
	8 west to Mission Beach Ingram Exit
	Take west mission bay drive
	Go right on Mission Blvd.

	On the corner of San Jose and mission blvd.
	It is located between roller coaster and garnett.
	It's kind of 40s looking building...  funky looking 
        (their description, not mine)

They serve stuff to eat, coffee stuff, and beer + wine.

See you there!

New guy, bring your fingerprint.

Drop me a note if you plan to attend... 

NOTE: My primary e-mail address has changed to use my own domain.  You can 
reach me at "claborne@cyberthought.com". Permanently replace any other address
that you may have for me.  I am currently not subscribed to the CP list since
my current internet connection is slow (I can't afford anything right now :)
