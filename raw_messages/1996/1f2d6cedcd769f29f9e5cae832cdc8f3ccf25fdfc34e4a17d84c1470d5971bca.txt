 This should depend on how the image/sound was obtained, though I am pretty
sure in most cases there would be easily detectable patterns.  They would
be the strongest in software-generated files, smaller in good reproductions
of precise recordings, and very small in noisy recordings.  In all cases,
the number of lower bits used for stego-messages may be chosen lower than
the existing noise of the signal.  Changing all lower bits in a good
rendered image may still be unnoticeable for the human viewer, but really
easy to detect to a program.
