- InfoWarCon (Europe) '96 ("Defining the European
Perspective" will be the theme of this year's InfoWarCon
to be held in Brussels, Belgium May 22 - 24, 1996.
Sponsors include National Computer Security Association;
Winn Schwartau, President and CEO, Interpact, Inc.; and
Robert David Steele, Chairman & CEO, Open Source
Solutions Group. Co-Sponsors include: IBM Internet
Security Systems; Jane's Information Group Network
Systems, Inc.; and Norman Data Defense. Overview:
Information Warfare represents a global challenge that
faces all late-industrial and information age nation states.
It also represents the easiest and cheapest way for less
developed nation-states and religious or political
movements to anonymously and grievously attack major
nations and international corporations. Not only are the
definitions of InfoWar unclear, but they span many areas
and disciplines. This conference will examine the
European perspectives on all three classes of Information
Warfare while contributing some American lessons
learned, mistakes made and successes enjoyed. The
conference will look at these three areas of interest: Class
I: Personal Privacy Class II: Industrial and Economic
Spying and Warfare Class III: Global Conflict, Terrorism
and the Military) => http://www.ncsa.com/iweuro96.html

- Devices now in field testing with the U.S. Marines,
according to  Ellison C. Urban, Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA) in his paper "The Information
Warrior"
(http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/publicaccess/1195inf1.html)
are described as follows:

The Tamer: The Tamer system consists of a global
positioning system (GPS) receiver, a liquid-crystal display
(LCD), thumb-input      devices, data ports, and software
for intelligence reports -- all in a single module integrated
with a standard-issue Melios laser rangefinder. In a future
version the LCD will be eliminated and a video capability
added; an intelligence report form filled out by the soldier
and automatically transmitted by a geopositioning satellite
will be superimposed on the scene through the viewfinder.

VoiceMap: Via the VoiceMap (or a similar system,
Pathfinder, shown on the Web site), the user's location is
fixed by a GPS receiver and then displayed on an
electronic map, where it is compared with the user's
itinerary. Maps can be scrolled or scaled with voice
commands, as well as updated with tactical data sent from
other units by radio link. In future, the attached computer
will have an artificial intelligence capability, permitting it to
respond to complex queries, such as "What is the best
route to way station Delta?"

VuMan: The VuMan is a body-hugging computer with an
easily manipulated circular dial that displays animations of
repair      procedures, replacing thousands of pages of
maintenance manuals. Soldiers simultaneously see both
their equipment and the computer information through a
head-up display.

MARSS: The  Maintenance and Repair Support System
(MARSS) is the first application planned for an electronic
vest called the bodyLAN, which provides a wireless local-
area network that interconnects with personnel and their
systems. A MARSS-equipped soldier wearing the vest can
walk up to a piece of equipment in need of repair -- a tank,
say -- and have it disgorge its self-diagnostics by radio to
the soldier's on-board computer. That computer, linked to
other devices, sorts the information and links up to
logistics stations in the rear or around the world. The
bodyLAN vest presents both potential benefits and
potential problems.).
The MARSS project is the first application of a central
element planned for all TIAs: a wireless local-area network
-- called a bodyLAN -- in a thin undervest to be worn by
every soldier. The vest will eliminate redundant electronic
components and link the remaining devices (and those of
other troops) via a common standard. But being in such
intimate contact, as it were, with such a device adds risks.
