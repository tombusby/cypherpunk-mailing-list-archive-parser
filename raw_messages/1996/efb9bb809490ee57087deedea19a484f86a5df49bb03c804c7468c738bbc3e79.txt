Indeed we have, and it verged on philosophical territory, and 
I would really enjoy discussing the issue again with you 
sometime, although perhaps we've gotten about as much as we can 
get out of it in e-mail.


But I think that _this_ issue is a lot simpler, and a lot easier
for us to agree on.  To wit:

Sure.  For my part, _I_ personally don't see key-signings as
mainly useful for verifying the "true name" of someone.  Rather
I view _my_ key signings as verifying that (for one reason or
other), I believe the owner of the key to be the originator of
the information that is published under that key (= nym).


All I am saying by talking of "misconceptions between using the
WoT to certify identities, versus using it to certify [...]
other qualities", is that each of these different uses of key-
signings are.. well..  _different_, and they shouldn't be
mistaken for one another.


Unfortunately PGP 2 only allows one kind of certificate.  The
"key-signature".  To PRZ and most other people, it is a
certificate asserting a mapping between a key and a true name.
To me it is as I described above.  To TCMay, it is a kind of
endorsement.  It's just too bad that PGP 2 doesn't have
different _kinds_ of certificates to represent these different
assertions.  Until a certificate technology like that is
implemented, and probably even after that time, we need to
avoid confusing these various meanings for "key-signatures".

Well here we have that epistemological issue again.  I believe
that there is a single "proper" or "best" ontological
interpretation of many or most belief networks.  (At least, of 
the belief networks that we care about.)  But skipping that
issue, my point in this post is just that there should be
informtion encoded in these belief nets/WoT's which
differentiates the different kinds.


Note that it is possible to differentiate between two meanings
without admitting that their meanings are meaningfully
ascertainable by humans...

Hey, maybe I should be more humble, or more gentle, but this is
the Internet, you know?  Here, I'll present a representation of
my internal Bayesian belief network with explicit mention of the
certainty qualifications:

"A.  Since Tim and I view things differently with respect to
this subject, one of us is wrong.
A's certainty: 0.95

B.  I am right.
B's certainty: 0.93

C.  (from A,B)  Tim is wrong.
C's certainty: (from A,B)  0.93*0.95=0.8835"


Now more seriously, the alacrity with which I bring up 
disagreements with Tim should in fact be construed as a measure
of my _respect_ for his opinions and for his mind, rather that
as a lack of respect for same.


Regards,

Bryce
