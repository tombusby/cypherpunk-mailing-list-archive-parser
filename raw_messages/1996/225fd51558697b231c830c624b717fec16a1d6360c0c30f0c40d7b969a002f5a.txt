I take some disagreement with that.

With patents, there is a problem of large companies owning them yet
doing nothing with them except suing other companies or individuals.
For example, look at arithmetic coding: there are many patents owned
on it, yet a lot of software using this means of compression may be in
violation of the patents... are the patent-owners publishing software
or makingh efforts to license it widely?  If anything, such patents
are getting in the way of using many algorithms.

Patents would be better if there was a good-faith attempt on the
part of the holder to "use it or lose it".  Somebody sitting on a
patent and doing nothing with it deserves to lose it after a number
of years.
