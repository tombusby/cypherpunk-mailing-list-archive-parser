I can't offer much that would satify Tim's needs,  he would have to look
elsewhere for that (I will restrain my comment about a size 12 boot)

The  Mac crtpyo workshop http://webstuff.apple.com/~opentpt/crypto.html is
just that,  a workshop:  a guerilla effort focused at Mac developers who
write code to start including crypto in thier code. I am also sponsering an
effort among developers to do keychain management on the Mac, In a manner
similar to the popular Internet Config. Developers get together, talk,
hack, and go home with plans to write stuff.

What I offer developers is much more important to me right now. people
complain about email apps not having built in crypto, I am trying to do
something about it.  So are folks like Olivier Merenne who does SafeMail
http://www.highware.com/highware/safemail/safemail.htm . these are the
kinds of people that I want to help.

The workshop us not a forum for the very people that Tim complains about,
to rant about how great the Mac is or isnt. or why crypto is good or bad, I
will leave that to the wired.coms  and other non-tech forums out there.

I agree with Tim, If you really want to hear tim talk, you cant ead his
rants on cp or I have a better idea, maybe you can send him some bucks and
he'll send you a cassette tape or something (I would suggest he makes a
quicktime movie and put it on your webpage or do a webcast, but that
requires you buy into the Apple world doesnt it, so maybe you can do the
windoze equiv)
