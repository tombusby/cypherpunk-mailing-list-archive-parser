I agree... the postings of Anonymous about "Timmy" pretty much just make
us want to killfile "Anonymous" more and more.  On the other hand (or
maybe its the same hand), Tim's response to these postings is basicly "I
have nothing to hide, take your best shot".  Personally, I havn't seen
Tim lie, cheat, steal, have sex with animals, etc., and until I do his
rep. is fine to me.
