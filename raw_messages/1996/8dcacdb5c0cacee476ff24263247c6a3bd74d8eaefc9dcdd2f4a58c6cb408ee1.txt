hmmm.... there is something strangely familiar about
the premise behind this story, but I can't seem to
figure out what it might be...


  JUDGE ORDERS DALLAS MAN TO CEASE HARASSMENT ON NET

  A district judge in Texas has issued a restraining order
  against a Dallas man who was using the Internet to post
  sexually derogatory remarks about the wife of a couple who
  operate an Internet Service Provider.

  The man said he had developed "a bad taste in (his) mouth"
  after trying unsuccessfully to reach the company to price
  its services;  however, he now "wholeheartedly, 100 percent"
  denies that his messages were threatening and insists that
  they merely adopted the sarcastic language typically found
  on the Internet.
