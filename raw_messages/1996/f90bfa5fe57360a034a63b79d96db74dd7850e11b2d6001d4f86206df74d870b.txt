My concern, since there is a DOS version available according to your 
announcement (and this applies to OS/2 and Linux compilations as well) is 
that your version assumes /dev/random produces a continuous stream rather 
than bursts of data limited to how much entropy is gathered.  A poor 
implementation even with a good driver is disasterous.

Hmmm... I'll have to check that out.

I'm curious as to what method you tyest the hardware RNG's entropy?

Yep.
