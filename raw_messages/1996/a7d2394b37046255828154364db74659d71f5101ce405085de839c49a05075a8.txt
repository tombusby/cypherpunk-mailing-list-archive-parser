                           AGENDA

The meeting will be structured with a tight agenda, having a
very focused sequence of work; it is definitely not for
general education. Some amount of review is appropriate, but
not much. The following agenda is tentative and will be
reviewed and modified on the pre-workshop discussion list.

Morning

*    Very briefly describe the MOSS, PGP, and S/MIME
     solutions
*    Review the functional and technical concerns
*    Review the extent to which each alternative satisfies
     the concerns
*    Seek consensus for concerns that qualify as
     requirements

Afternoon

*    Haggle about the strengths and weaknesses of the
     technical alternatives
*    Explore the choices and/or negotiate a preferred
     solution
