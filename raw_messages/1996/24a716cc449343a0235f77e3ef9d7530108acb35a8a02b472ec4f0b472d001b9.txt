C-punks:

You can now check out the features of the WinSock 
Remailer at:

  http://www.c2.org/~winsock/

The remailer is now scheduled to be operational 
about March 21, 1996.  After a one month alpha test, the
executable will be available for download for beta
testing by anyone who wants to run a remailer.
