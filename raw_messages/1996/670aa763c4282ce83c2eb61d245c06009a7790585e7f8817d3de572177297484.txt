You are confused because you wonder how it could be that the couple could
appreciate having their bags searched, something you intuitively regard as
a violation of their rights. The very simple answer is that, generally
speaking, individuals enjoy to have their rights violated, provided that
they are given a (often false) sense of security in return.

Surveys from a few years ago showed that a majority of Americans would
approve of warrantless house-to-house searches, including their own, to
combat the use of narcotics.
