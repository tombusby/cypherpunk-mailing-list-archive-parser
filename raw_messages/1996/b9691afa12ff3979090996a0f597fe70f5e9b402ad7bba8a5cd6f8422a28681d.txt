ABSTRACT
WhoWhere? is the largest directory of personal and corporate
phone numbers, physical addresses and e-mail addresses on the
Internet.  As the Net rapidly evolves, defines and redefines
itself, WhoWhere? provides a worldwide collection of fundamental
information which serves both individual and business
communication needs.  It has become the Global White Pages and
enables people to locate others around the world, whether they
are on or off the Net. Gunjan Sinha will share the challenges
associated with building and maintaining this type of directory
and the ways in which it can be utilized.
