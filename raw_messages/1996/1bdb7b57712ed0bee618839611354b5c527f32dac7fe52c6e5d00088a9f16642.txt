WHAT'S NEW

Senator John Kerry, who voted in favor of the Communications Decency
Act and who has been dragging his feet on the encryption issue in the
Senate Commerce Committee, is on the Democratic Convention Chat schedule 
for this Wednesday, 4pm CDT (5pm EST).

Like many Senators, John Kerry's views are a combination of his personal
opinions, plus his perception of his constituencies' opinion.  When
he voted IN FAVOR OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT, he was not listening
to his constituency very well.  The high tech community of Cambridge 
must make him understand that bad Internet policy, like the Communications
Decency Act, can kill this industry, causing us to lose our jobs and the
state to lose a valuable industry.

Although Sen. Kerry shouldn't be let off the hook for voting of the CDA,
he needs to be shown that in hindsight, this was a terrible vote. Hostility
will not change his mind though, so please don't ask questions like,
"Senator, what the heck were you thinking when you voted for this stupid
bill which everyone knew was unconstitutional?"

Questions like these will just cause him to wrap himself in a "protecting
children" speech.  Instead, why not try questions like,

"Senator, don't you think that enough has changed in the past several months
 that would suggest that parents are really the best ones to control their
 kids access to the net?  Would you still vote for the CDA today?"

"Senator, don't you agree laws such as the CDA are really a poor second to
 a little bit of plain old parenting?  If more parents were to learn about
 the net, would there still be a need for the CDA?"

"Senator, I surf the net with my 10-year-old.  I think that's a far better
 cry than the CDA.  What could we do to encourage more parents to take this
 approach, rather than passing laws that harm Massachusetts businesses and
 freedom of speech?"

Know that the urge to flame him for his vote on the CDA will be strong.
It should be, it was a terrible position for someone from such an incredibly
net-savvy state.  No matter how you view politics, it was a poor move.
It angers both the business and public.  Please do not flame him, instead
try to change his mind.

It is imperative that the net community come out and show him this is a 
very serious issue for us, and that we won't forget his position on this.
Remember, the chat is at 4pm CDT, which is 5PM EST.  Please show up
early, as this is likely to be a very full chat.

WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN THESE CHATS

The Democratic convention's online chat program has begun!  It's crucial
that Netizens make net concerns a high profile issue in the online chats
this year.  You can do this by showing up and simply asking the right
questions.  Does the candidate think the Communications Decency Act is
an effective method of shielding kids from material online, or parental
control?  Does the candidate support the use of privacy-enhancing 
encryption technology?  Does the candidate support program such as
THOMAS, that put government info in the hands of the people?

If you don't ask these questions, they'll never know we care.
