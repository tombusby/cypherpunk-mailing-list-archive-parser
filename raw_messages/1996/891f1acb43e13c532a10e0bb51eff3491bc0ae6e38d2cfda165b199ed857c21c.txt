Some will say this has nothing to do with cryptography, but I want to share
something about Dave Winer.

Dave Winer wrote "MORE." the outline processor I wrote my Cyphernomicon FAQ
in (and many other things over the years). Winer originally wrote "Think
Tank," which I also had on my original IBM PC, circa 1983-4, and then
"MORE," for the Macintosh. These were the preeminent outline processors, a
market niche which has, sadly, almost vanished. (The outliner in Microsoft
Word is primitive and cumbersome by comparison. FrameMaker, an otherwise
extremely powerful writing tool, lacks an outline mode altogether. Hence I
seldom use it.)

Winer and his partners (not sure who they were) sole their company, Living
Videotext, to Symantec. Symantec supported MORE for a couple of upgrades,
then let it fade out. (MORE 3.1 still runs flawlessly on my Macintosh
7100av, with System 7.1.2, but will likely eventually stop working with
some version of the System.)

I've seen new-in-the-box copies of MORE 3.1 for $75 at Weird Stuff
Warehouse, in Sunnyvale, CA. I highly recommend MORE for any of you Mac
users out there.

(In case anyone is wondering, no, I don't use MORE to write my things for
this list. Conventional text editing is sufficient for these relatively
short items. I don't even use a spulling checker anymore.)
