I'm sorry to hear this, but it's predictable.

One of the worst aspects of the Communications Decency Act is that it
undermines criticism of similar acts in other countries. If Germany,
Turkey, Singapore, or China censor their computer users and establish
controls, critics will be met with a pointer to the U.S. policies. If even
the country that spends the most effort bragging about its love of liberty
is seen as censoring the Net, then surely it is a reasonable thing to do.

(We've seen similar cases in other contexts, where the United States boasts
about its free trade policies while forcing Canadians to reduce production,
or limits the amount of crops grown, etc. Other examples are readily
apparent.)

If the U.S. sees the need to control thoughtcrime, so will other countries.
