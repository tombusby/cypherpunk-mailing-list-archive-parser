Forum shopping.

Not that I would encourage you to break the law, but this method appears
to work quite well.

Get P.O. Box in state which issues DL's on the spot w/o fingerprinting.
Write yourself a letter in very light pencil to this P.O. box.
Get postmarked letter and erase the address.
Replace address with address of local sports stadium or empty lot in pen
complete with return address.

This letter is often accepted as proof of address and residence.
Use the rest of your documents as normal to obtain driver's license in the
state of your choice.

Some jurisdictions (D.C. is a good example) are such a joke it's not
funny.  An associate of mine literally MADE his own Italian Driver's
license and turned it in, took an eye test, and walked out with a nice new
D.C. license.

Who the hell knows what an italian license looks like?

I was once standing in line at a DMV where some schmuck was clearly trying
to work his way past the "guardian" with bogus documents.
They just shook their head, despite his repeated protests.  No one has the
time to muck around with cops in there.

Even if they did, you are just getting a license with a bogus address, not
a bogus name or anything.  It's a pretty hard case to make.

Point being that it does require effort, but it also pays off.  (For seven
years in the right jurisdictions).
