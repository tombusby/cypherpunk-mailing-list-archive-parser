C'punks,

Earlier this week some people on a british financial services list I lurk
on talked about this book. I forwarded the reference to e$pam, and one of
my e$ list people hunted it down.

It's a book for british financial people on, heh, how not to be a
money-launderer...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
