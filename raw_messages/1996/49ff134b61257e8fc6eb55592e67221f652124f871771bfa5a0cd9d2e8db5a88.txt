Version 2.0

Last update August 25, 1996

This file is available at any time by e-mailing to

+++IMPORTANT+++
We ask that all users read this document and look at the charter for
what is acceptable use of this mailing list. We also ask that if you
haven't done so, send e-mail to <manners@plaidworks.com>. That file
contains the general rules we administer this list under, as well as
hints that we've found help people write e-mail messages which are
easier to understand and help the mailing lists function smoothly.

Everyone using these lists is expected to abide by the rules in these
files. We don't consider ignorance of the rules an excuse for
unacceptable behavior. Please work with us to make this a fun,
interesting and educational place to be. 
+++IMPORTANT+++

Administrative messages sent to the mailing lists will have a subject
that begins with "Admin:". Please read these messages, as they have
important information about the state of the lists and systems and
changes that might affect how you use it.

If you want to find out what else is available on this server, send
e-mail to <info@plaidworks.com>. It will return a document listing all
of our services.

We have written a tutorial on using the listproc mail server. You can
get a copy of that by sending e-mail to
<listproc-help@plaidworks.com>.

============
1) The Sharks Family of Lists
============
The following sharks-related lists are available on plaidworks.com:

sharks: This list is for discussion of on-ice related things ONLY.
    Players, games, that sort of thing. It should relate to the game of
    hockey and the San Jose Sharks in some way, or it belongs on one of
    the other lists.

sharks-chat: This list is for discussion of the off-ice related aspects
    of the Sharks: arena, organizational issues, complaints about
    ticket prices or the cost of beer. Anything having to do with the
    San Jose Sharks club OTHER than the team itself and what they do
    goes here.

    In general, if it is about the TEAM, put it in Sharks. If it is
    about the organization, put it in Sharks-Chat. If you aren't sure,
    put it in Sharks-Chat or ask one of the List Moms for advice.

sharks-tickets: For the sale and purchase of tickets to Sharks games by
    the users of our mailing list. No dealers or brokers, and sales
    during the regular season must be at no more than face value.

Please see the charters below for detailed descriptions of what is and
is not acceptable material for these lists.

There are other mailing lists available as well. Please send e-mail to
<info@plaidworks.com> to get a listing of their names, topics, and
subscription information.

============
2) Who to contact for help and advice
============
The List Moms (or Sysops) for these lists are:

    Chuq Von Rospach (e-mail: <chuqui@plaidworks.com>)
    Laurie Sefton (e-mail: <lsefton@plaidworks.com>)

    Mailing List problems: <server@plaidworks.com>

Please try to follow the directions. If you can't make things work,
drop us a note and we'll be happy to help. Try us second, though: we're
your helpers, not your baby-sitters. The time we spend doing
administrative things is time we can't spend creating better services
for you.

============
3) Subscription Info: Important Mail Server commands
============

To subscribe or unsubscribe to a mailing list, you must send an e-mail
command to the address <listproc@plaidworks.com>. Leave the subject
line blank or put a nonsense word in it -- do not put Listproc commands
in the subject, or Listproc will reject the message.  For complete
details on using listproc, get the listproc tutorial mentioned above.

Here are the listproc commands to subscribe to these mailing lists:
    SUBSCRIBE sharks your real name goes here
    SUBSCRIBE sharks-chat your real name goes here
    SUBSCRIBE sharks-tickets your real name goes here

Here are the commands to unsubscribe from these mailing lists:
    UNSUBSCRIBE sharks
    UNSUBSCRIBE sharks-chat
    UNSUBSCRIBE sharks-tickets

If you want to switch a list to digest mode, use these commands:
    SET sharks MAIL DIGEST
    SET sharks-chat MAIL DIGEST
    SET sharks-tickets MAIL DIGEST

If you want to switch a list from digest mode, use these commands:
    SET sharks MAIL ACK
    SET sharks-chat MAIL ACK
    SET sharks-tickets MAIL ACK

Remember, all listproc commands go to <listproc@plaidworks.com>, not
the main mailing list.

You can put more than one command in an e-mail message. Please note
that if your e-mail messages contain signatures, listproc will attempt
to read them as commands and return an error to you. This can be
ignored if you also get the confirmation back on the earlier commands.
You should get a confirmation e-mail or error warning for EVERY command
you send to listproc. If you didn't, something went wrong. Try it
again, and if it still doesn't work, contact <server@plaidworks.com>
for help.

============
4) Sending messages to the mailing lists
============
To post to the mailing lists, send mail to the appropriate list address:
    <sharks@plaidworks.com>
    <sharks-chat@plaidworks.com>
    <sharks-tickets@plaidworks.com>

You must be a subscriber to the list to post to it. Listproc (the mail
server we use) is very picky about your address: it will not recognize
you as a subscriber except from the account where you sent the
SUBSCRIBE command from.

============
5) Charter: What's Acceptable, What's Not
============
There is a file of general rules and guidelines that we ask users to
abide by on these mailing lists. If you haven't done so send e-mail to
<manners@plaidworks.com> to get this list and please read it. We don't
consider ignorance of the rules an excuse for unacceptable behavior.
Please work with us to make this a fun, interesting and educational
place to be.

Sharks: This list is for discussion of on-ice related things ONLY.
    Players, games, that sort of thing. It should relate to the game of
    hockey and the San Jose Sharks in some way, or it belongs on one of
    the other lists.

Sharks-Chat: This list is for discussion of the off-ice related aspects
    of the Sharks: arena, organizational issues, complaints about
    ticket prices or the cost of beer. Anything having to do with the
    San Jose Sharks club OTHER than the team itself and what they do
    goes here.

    In general, if it is about the TEAM, put it in Sharks. If it is
    about the organization, put it in Sharks-Chat. If you aren't sure,
    put it in Sharks-Chat or ask one of the List Moms for advice.

Sharks-Tickets: the place to buy and sell tickets. Please do not put
    ticket requests on any of the other lists. The groundrules: no
    commercial services may use the list. Tickets may be sold ONLY for
    face value.  There is no scalping on the list. Period. For the
    playoffs, we relax this rule in the following way: tickets may be
    sold but prices may not be listed in the messages. Keep the
    transaction private. Anyone found violating this, or found selling
    tickets above face value during the regular season, may be kicked
    off the list permanently. This is a service to our readers, not a
    source of income.

6) How to find the Home Page, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
============
The World Wide Web home page for these mailing lists is:
    <http://hockey.plaidworks.com/sharks/>

The World Wide Web pages are all written and maintained by Mike Lamar
<mlamar@plaidworks.com>. If you have questions or comments on them, please
contact Mike.

This document is:
    <ftp://plaidworks.com/hockey/nhl/sharks/sharks.INTRO>

If you aren't sure how to access the World Wide Web or FTP from your
site, please ask your local administrators for advice, since it varies
for different organizations and types of computers. If you can't get
help locally, drop private e-mail to one of the List Moms, and we'll do
what we can do to get you started.

The FTP archive is in the directory <~ftp/hockey/nhl/sharks/>.

All messages to the list are archived in the "message.archives" folder
in the subdirectory with the same name as the list you're looking for.
If you have WWW access, there will be a searchable database of the
message real soon now.

If you have no access via FTP, these files can be accessed through
listproc. e-mail <listproc-help@plaidworks.com> for instructions. Note
that because this is a very lightly used function and time intensive
for the List Mom, it's rarely up to date. Consider it a last resort.
