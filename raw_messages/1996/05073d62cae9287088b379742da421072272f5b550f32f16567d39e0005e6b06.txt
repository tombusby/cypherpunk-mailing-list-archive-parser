We need to consider separately costs of unmetered access to the ISP, and 
unmetered access to the Internet.  I expect that the main reason for these 
limited-time plans have little to do with Internet traffic, and a lot to do 
with local phone link limits.

One big cost for at least small ISPs is local telephone lines.  Due to the 
"infinite wisdom" of rate commissions, business-line charges are 
substantially higher than residential.  (and ISP's are businesses...)   A 
person who uses 6 hours per day of connection to his ISP is occupying at 
least 1/4th of the capacity of one phone line, and given typical circadian 
usage patterns, in practice he's using 1/3rd or more.  If the ISP's cost for 
that telephone line is $30 per month, then that user must be charged $10 per 
month for this service just to cover this cost.  That customer, however, 
might only be using a rather tiny fraction of the ISP's actual Internet-line 
capacity, except possibly when his Internet telephone is operating.  Also, 
the customer isn't inclined to occupy his own telephone for this length of 
time, either, especially if he has only one line.

So it seems to me that within 5 years or so, there ought to be a powerful 
incentive to wire up apartment complexes and business parks with alternative 
Internet/Internet-telephone connections, ones which bypass the phoneco for 
at least the first few hundred feet.  This, possibly in concert with a 
ISDN-driving concentrator or a cable-modem, should reduce the cost of the 
customer-to-the-ISP line to a very low value.
