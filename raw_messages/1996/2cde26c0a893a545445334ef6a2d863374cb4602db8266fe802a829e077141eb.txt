NEWS

The hemorrhaging of the White House publicity campaign surrounding the
Clipper III proposal that started in Interactive Week and the House of
Representatives continues today in the Senate.  Earlier today we received
the attached press release from Senator Burns' (R-MT) office.

Although this author has not yet seen the proposal, it is wonderful to
see Congress leading the fight against the White House on this issue.
>From the recent slew of encryption legislation (H.R. 3011, S.1587, &
S.1726), it's clear that Congress understands that the best people in
the world to sort out this issue are the public and industry.  The
three Clipper plans have been hatched by a secretive Executive agency
without considering the needs of the public and industry.

This is the start of a highly-charged tug-of-war between Congress and the
White House over who holds the keys to your privacy: you, or the government?
Congress says you, the White House says the government.  It's crucial that
we support Congress as they go head-to-head with the White House.

Keep an eye out for the first leaks and analyses of the Clipper III report 
that will undoubtedly appear on the net soon.

                                DON'T FORGET!

     Burns: Clipper III Strikes Out
     New Clinton Computer "Wiretap" Plan Circulates With Few Changes
     
        WASHINGTON, D.C. _ Montana Senator Conrad Burns today criticized 
     the Clinton administration's latest computer security proposal as yet 
     another government-driven mandate and urged swift passage of Burns' 
     "Pro-CODE" bill, which addresses export of encryption technology and 
     prohibits mandatory decryption-key escrow.  Burns reacted to the 
     circulation of a draft administration proposal entitled "Achieving 
     Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public Safety in the Global 
     Information Infrastructure."
     
        The proposal, dated May 10 and dubbed "Clipper III" by critics, 
     moves toward the loosening and possibly eventual elimination of export 
     controls on encryption technologies, but only if companies and 
     individuals surrender a copy of their code keys to a 
     government-approved third party.
     
        "It's three strikes and you're out at the old ball game, and I 
     would say that the third version of the administration's Clipper Chip 
     proposal is a swing and a miss," Burns said.  "It's time to quit 
     relying on government mandates for what is truly a matter of great 
     concern to the private sector: the expansion of commerce on the 
     Internet and other computer networks.
     
        "The administration has been using export restrictions as a billy 
     club to force American companies into accepting government control 
     over the keys to their computer files and transmissions.  At least 
     this new proposal admits that the current 40-bit limit on exports is 
     outdated and a poor guarantee of electronic security and integrity, 
     but it again operates from the standpoint that the government, and not 
     the private sector, knows best when it comes to key strength and 
     control over those keys.
     
        "We can only stick our heads in the sand for so long.  It is 
     important to point out that the criminals and trouble-makers who are 
     apparently targets of this plan are unlikely to enroll in any 
     key-escrow system.  Law-abiding businesses and individuals would 
     suffer at the hands of this misguided proposal.
     
        "While this may appear to be a compromise of the administration's 
     earlier positions, we have to remember that an executive action can be 
     reversed just as quickly after an election year.  It is crucial that 
     we pass legislation to codify a solution to the administration's 
     current outdated export policies, and to ensure that the government 
     won't force anyone to give up the keys to their computers."
