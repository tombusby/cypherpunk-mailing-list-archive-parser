Littman mentions toad.com twice -- that site, a character says, 
suspiciously, "run by one of the founders of Sun." Used, 
allegedly by the perp, to get into the drawers of, Well, you 
know.


BTW, Littman says, and that Markoff agrees, that it was not 
Mitnick who got into Shimomura's underware, but, more than 
likely, the "Israeli." Apparently, an incident occurred after 
Kevin's bust.


Agree with Tim that the Markoff/Shimomura book is needed to see 
both sides.


For now, Mitnick seems to be a hapless pawn. Me too, about 
stuff I only read about.
