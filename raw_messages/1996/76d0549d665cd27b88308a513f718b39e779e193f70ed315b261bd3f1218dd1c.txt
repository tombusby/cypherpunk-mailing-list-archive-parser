	You have a point. Speaking of this issue, as I understand it the
RSA patents only apply in the US; their copyrights apply outside the US, but
there are replacement "parts" for their library for outside of the US which
don't run into those copyrights. What happens if I telnet into an account
outside the US and download into that account, from an outside of the US
distribution point, a copy of Mixmaster with the substitute ones, then start
using it for profit (an ecash-accepting-program or whatever)? I assume that I'd
get around ITAR this way - I'm not exporting it, I didn't even bring it into
the US to bring it back out - but can RSA sue me/my company (I'd do it through
a company) for patent infringement?
