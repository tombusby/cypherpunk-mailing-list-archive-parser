Well, as soon as people can charge a cyber-dime/quarter/or buck to read/
download you will see a change. Most authors make little (like $1.00/copy)
from book sales so if made cheap enough so that is easier to download than 
pirate you will see a big change.

Why bother (kind like reinventing ASCII), we have good, proven crypto
algorithms, some even in public domain. Is easy to code. Hard part is
making it fast and easy & available anywhere (what I like about the 
PGP enclyptor). Another hard part is good key management. Like computer
viruses in which there is nothing interesting about the propagation (what
makes a virus a virus), the crypto part is a done deal, have had good
stuff for years.

Ah yes, being hearing impaired I always wanted a watch that would poke. My
1968 Seiko "Bellmatic" is close - ringing the bell makes it vibrate.

Not futile, just already done. Should concentrate on things that are
"impossible" 8*).
