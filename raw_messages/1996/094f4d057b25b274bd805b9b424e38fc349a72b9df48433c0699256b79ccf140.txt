Frankly perry, you're a fucking child and I can't remember reading anything
intelegent from you in this list at all.  Jim Bell at least contributes
ideas.  You generate garbage.  I'm a patient man, but you've finally done

"Prohibition... goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to
control a man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things
that are not crimes... A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very
principles upon which our government was founded."

On the meridian of time there is no injustice, only the poetry of motion
