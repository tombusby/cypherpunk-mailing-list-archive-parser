And I thought my newsfeed was bad!

Do an Alta Vista (or DejaNews, etc.) search of "The Truth Machine" and
you'll find about 300 articles on Usenet about it.

However, about 95% of them are from jhalpe@ix.netcom.com, the author of
this media event novel or from ivypress@ix.netcom.com, his vanity
publisher.

(Actually, maybe Ivy Press is not a vanity publisher. Maybe Ivy Press is
what might me dubbed a "Cantwell and Siegel publisher.")

And the groups this was posted to....mama mia! This is why I was irked that
this spam was leaking into the Cypherpunks group as well.

But no harm done, and it demonstrates another example of how the Net is
being used for such advertising. Imminent death of the Net predicted--news
at 11.
