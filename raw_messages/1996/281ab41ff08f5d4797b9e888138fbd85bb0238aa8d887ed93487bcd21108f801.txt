Thanks for the info.  Downloading now and it appears to be going more 
smoothly than the time I got beta 6.  No delays and good throughput.  And I 
have yet to talk with someone that has successfully downloaded the `other 
guys` 128-bit version.  I sure have not been able to!

Thanks,

Lou Zirko
