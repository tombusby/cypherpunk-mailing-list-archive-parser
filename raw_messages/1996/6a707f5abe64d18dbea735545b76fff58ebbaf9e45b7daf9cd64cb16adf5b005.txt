I think what most people want is no surprises, by that I mean that peoples
perceptions of privacy should match reality.   In many cases that will mean
no demographics.  However there are a lot of situations where people will
trade information for something they perceive as having value.  I see
nothing wrong with this *if* there is informed consent.
