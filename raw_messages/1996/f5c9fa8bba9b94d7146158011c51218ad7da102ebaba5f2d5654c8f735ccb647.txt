All of these are products of misconceptions between using the 
WoT to certify identities, versus using it to certify how much 
you trust a person to certify someone else's identify, versus 
using it to certify arbitrary other qualities about a person.


For example, there is no reason why the hypothetical racist "Tom
Metzger" would sign no black people's keys.  A key signature
(PGP style) is just an assertion about the identity of someone.
Haven't racists engraved markings on people's clothes,
buildings, land, bodies and other belongings in order to
identify the owners?  So why not do the same for keys.


This is illustrative of how much confusion reigns about keys,
certs, nyms, signatures and cetera right now.


I hope that TCMay is pointing out how _most_ people lack a 
proper understanding of the differences, rather than reflecting
his own lack of understanding.


Phil Zimmermann was confused about this, I think, when he wrote 
"Trust is not transitive.".  Some kinds of trust _are_ 
transitive (with a coefficient, of course).  Hm.  I wonder if 
there are kinds of trust whose transitivity coefficient is 1?
