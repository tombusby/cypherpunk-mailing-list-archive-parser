Hmmmhhh....

It may be--from the comments of Dan W. about the NSA, export, and Java, and
from other signs--that the NSA and its allies see the same opportunities
many of us see. And that they don't like what they see.

I hope Marianne and the other Sun and/or Netscape folks can keep us
informed on what, if anything, the NSA is telling them they can do with
Java and what they cannot do. Under the guise of "export," of course, as
there is no legal basis for restricting domestic (within the Greater Unites
States and Canada Coprosperity Sphere) crypto.

An interesting situation for the ITARs, if they try to restrict bignum
classes, for example. A class-based system, if done correctly (in whatever
language, e.g., C++ or Java), should have _most_ of the hard crypto work
already implemented in classes and methods (for bignums, modular
exponentiation, etc.), with the final crypto program much more easily
implemented and exported.

(I presume that PGP 3.0 is being done largely this way (class libraries),
and, speculatively, PGP 4.0 might be Java-based, and rely on small applets
calling the various classes.)

Does the battle for restricting exports of programs, a la PGP or Lotus
Notes, then shift to controlling the export of computer languages?!
