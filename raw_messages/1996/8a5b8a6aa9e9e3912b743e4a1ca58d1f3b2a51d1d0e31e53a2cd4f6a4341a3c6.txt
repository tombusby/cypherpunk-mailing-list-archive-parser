I recall you were interested in how the Austrians would answer this.  I
think that they would object to the question because of their aversion to
aggregates.  Some individuals are better off and some worse off.  The
Austrians would deny that you can sum the results for individuals and get
a result for the economy as a whole.  This is because of Austrian
subjectivity.

Assume that I move a programming job to India, and make the required
capital investments.

I am presumably better off (otherwise I wouldn't have moved the capital).

The worker I fire here in the US is worse off.

(Other effects you have mentioned go here).

Now, considering only me and the laid off worker, is this change overall
good or bad?  To answer this, you would have to compare the value of my
gain to the value of the workers loss.  But you can't.  Value is
subjective.  And, it only gets harder when you try to take into account
the other people affected.

P.S.
Bart, your quotes of other people are hard to follow.
