Good question! Something that not enough people are asking.

There were like two or three dozen hits. Period. But I think Declan 
publicized his mirror more widely, and probably got a few more.

You can get aggregate hit counts for all files in "/~llurch" through the 
www-leland.stanford.edu main page (features, I think).

I'm not sure I'll be able to get a server log dump because it would just
be so huge -- not because of the Zundelumpen, but because of the Windows
95 FAQ in my directory, which got a lot of press in early January. 

Zundel's main site at webcom.com did not just become popular and
overloaded with the press reports. It has always been overloaded because
he's a dumbshit who posts 3MB RealAudio files on the main page.
