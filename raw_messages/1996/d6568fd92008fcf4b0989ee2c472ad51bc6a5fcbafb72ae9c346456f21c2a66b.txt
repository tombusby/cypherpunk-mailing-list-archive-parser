+ "Contempts such as failure to comply with document discovery, for

+ indirect contempts involving discrete, readily ascertainable acts,

+ the discretion of a judge.  Compelling through sanctions the 
+ production of a "key" (though I'm not sure a crypto key is directly 
+ contemplated) is likewise clearly permitted.

Producing a physical key may or may not be testimonial under the
"production privilege" doctrine established by the Supreme Court in
Fisher and the Doe cases.  Producing a *crypto* key -- if it exists
only in one's mind -- is indisputably full-fledged Fifth Amendment
testimony.  I refer you to the language in Doe II (joined by all 9
Justices) distinguishing between "the key to a safe and the
combination to a safe" -- the latter enjoying full Fifth Amendment
protection from forced disclosure.
