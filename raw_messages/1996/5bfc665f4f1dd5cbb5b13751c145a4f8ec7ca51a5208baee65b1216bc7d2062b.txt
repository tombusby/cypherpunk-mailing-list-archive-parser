This is a misleading challenge.  There's a helluva difference between the OTP and a
Public Key system.  If, for example, it can be proven that I can crank up PGP to its
most cryptic level, and send the OTP overseas with "absolute security", so that I
can now send messages with the OTP which was crunched with PGP's highest security,
then that would mean something.

Just so there's no misunderstanding:

1. The OTP is absolutely unbreakable. (if done correctly)
2. The OTP encryption cannot be decoded on the other end unless you can deliver the
   OTP to the person on the other end by a secure means.
3. PGP, which is not usually used at its highest level of security (for all bits in
   a message), *will* be used at its highest level of security to send the OTP to the
   person on the other end.
4. The OTP arrives on the other end, completely safe from snooping.

Now you see the problem.  #4 above can't be assured, and that is why Ed says that PGP
is not shut off "right now", because it's probably not "really secure".

I'm amused to think that, in a nation armed with 20,000 or so nukes, the paranoid of
paranoid nation-states as it were, some of the erstwhile intelligent citizens think
that the U.S. military are just sitting around wringing their hands over the "fact"
that the citizens have "unbreakable" crypto.

Bear in mind the Scientific American articles on Public Key crypto back in the 1970's.
The military knew the score back then, and if you think they just sat back and allowed
all this to happen, well, sorry, I don't believe in Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny.
