The Iraqi People's Benovolent Security Protection Brigade (IPBSPB) has no
need to snoop the lines, at least for my communications, as I am
voluntarily escrowing my communications keys as well as my storage key with
the IPBSPB.

To the United States government requesting a global key escrow regimen, be
careful what you ask for, as you may get it.

(Question: I know that the Iraqi IPBSPB has close relations with the French
SDECE, so does this mean I can just escrow my keys with the Iraqis and
assume they have let the boys at SDECE get copies?)

notoriously corrupt security services have access to all communications of
Americans."

Ignorance is Strength, Escrow is Security, Arbeit Macht Frei.
