I have posted my new, extensive list of classified military programs (and 
the references I used to find them) in the FY 1997 budget at:

  http://www.frogi.org/classified-programs.html

(NOTE: requires a Web browser with table support)

There are some shocking revelations such as 31% of the Air Force's research
and development budget is being spent on programs whose purpose -and- cost 
is classified. Doesn't anyone believe in public accountability for taxpayer
money?
