	The poor still having enough to survive is the most significant
reason I'm not an anarcho-capitalist. There are a few others, but that's the
main one.

	Despite its agreeing with my point (thank you), I'm not sure if I'd
consider income taxes to be enough of the story to go by them alone. Federal
level, yes; state & local, probably not. I am willing to bet that property
taxes are mainly paid by the relatively wealthy, given how much of personal
capital tends to get tied up in a home. Sales taxes are more evenly
distributed.
	However, the economic changes I discuss should result in this becoming
true, even if it might not be completely true currently.

>Of course only talking about the rich makes things so much easier.

	Yes. In a capitalist society based on merit, the rich are the ones
who matter in the long run.
