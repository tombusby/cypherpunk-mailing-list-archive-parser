This is supposed to have a legal basis?

Duncan, it's even easier. Here ya go:

1. Buy a copy of Windows 95.
2. Install it on a machine.
3. Install it on a second machine.

There, SPA: you can now go sue every ISP from which every reader of
this list obtains their mail.  They have just published information 
on how to pirate Windows '95.
