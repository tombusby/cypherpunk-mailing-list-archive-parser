  Opening:   WASHINGTON -- Computer companies and the federal
             government appear to have peacefully resolved a fierce
             battle over the export of powerful coding software in
             computers.

             The computer makers plan to use new technology that would
             block the use of code circuitry in exported computers
             unless both buyer and seller obtain licenses in this
             country.

             The coding software is designed to help people prevent
             their electronic mail, files, credit-card numbers and the
             like from being read by hackers and thieves.
