I have no problem whatsoever with this.
Guess which option I'd choose :-)

However, given the hysteria that is surrounding the CDA, etc., I think that
the second option would be "politically unacceptable". The whole thrust [

is that it's not good enough for parents to take responsibility for their
children's use; the government must be involved.
