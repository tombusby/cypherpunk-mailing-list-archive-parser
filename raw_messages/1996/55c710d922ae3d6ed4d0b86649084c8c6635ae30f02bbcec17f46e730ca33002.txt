I vote for "nobody".  I firmly believe that those who will not accept
responsibility for themselves are best removed from the gene pool
(preferably before they have the opportunity to breed).

That they are allowed to "get away with it" is a _big_ problem.  But the
typical 'liberal' solutions to social problems seem (at least to me) all
centered around disallowing failure.  Thus the "hapless drug victim"
must be coddled and supported by society (at our expense, of course),
lest they experience discomfort.

I like to point out that evolution always requires multiple generations,
and that when nothing dies, nothing evolves.  This means, of course,
that the liberal money-throwers are unlikely to ever see their
"benevolence" produce a good result, even if said benevolence _could_
produce improvements.  And while offering up the public teat may help in
certain limited and individual cases, it generally only weakens the
resolve of the suckler to improve hir situation.

Failure should _never_ be disallowed or legislated away.  It's the
single most important contributor to evolution (animal or social).

OBDisclaimer: As a matter of fact, I _am_ a Social Darwinist.
