If AP came to be seen as an acceptable way for business and citizens to
right egregious wrongs it would quickly lead to a 'law of the jungle'
situation, which I think any sane person would reject as the cure being
worse than the disease.  However, if governemnts (especially ours) continue
to expand their implied authority and greatly diminishing personal
liberties we all took for granted were inaliable human rights (in our own
best interest, of course), a time may come when a bit of rebellion may be
the only viable alternative for self-correction.  I pray it never comes to
this, but Thomas Jefferson contemplating this said:

"God forbid we should ever be 20 years without such a rebellion. . . .What
country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned from
time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance?. . .The
tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of
patriots and tyrants."

  --  Thomas Jefferson, regarding Shay's Rebellion and anarchy.
