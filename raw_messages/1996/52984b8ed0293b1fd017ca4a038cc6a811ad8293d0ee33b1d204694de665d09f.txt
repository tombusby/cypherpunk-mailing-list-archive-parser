Thanks to all list members who responded on this issue.

The consensus is that bouncing bad signatures to the list is not a 
good idea.

In the interest of reducing the number of bad signatures caused by 
munging which appear on the list, I will continue to bounce messages 
with bad signatures to the originator only.

Thanks,

Geoff Klein.
