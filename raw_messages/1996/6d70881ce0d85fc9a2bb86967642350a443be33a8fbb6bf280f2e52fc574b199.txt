Indeed!  But I tend to use them for A.I. Research, and there is little
left of 'em for them mailing listes ya knaw! :-) :-)

The American and European public, i.e. _we_ who trust those people! :-)

You mean my check for $ 1.000.000 is... coming? :-)

Cheers
George

P.S.  The reasons I'd decline the check are simply the difficulties in
      having to (1) hide from your authorities as an 'illegal immigrant',
      (2) having to work for someone else as opposed to myself (as I do
      over here) andf (3) having to hire a psychiatrist sooner or later!

All this maan, is more costly than $ 1.000.000.

And... yes, I _am_ nutts! (Aren't we all? ;-) )
