I agree.  It would be necessary to marshal widespread public support
to eliminate strong crypto.  If the Four Horsemen scenario is
available, this support would be available.

Sure, it's not really worth the effort.  How much effort will you
go to prevent your children from being kidnapped?

In the case of a largely compliant public, this isn't all that expensive.

This is a highly likely scenario.  But in the scenarios proposed by
the GAKers, even the privacy advocates would be reluctant to defend
crypto.

Gee, I hope you don't have to send many messages if you have to travel
across the country to deliver them.  How will you operate an anonymous
business this way?  It doesn't sound like cryptoanarchy to mean.

I think people probably would put a stop to the madness.  But, under
the Four Horsemen scenario, most people, even Mr. Huge Cajones Remailer,
would not consider it to be madness.

This is interesting.  I would be quite interested to see real evidence
that various spook agencies have been foot dragging on the GAKers plans.

Yes, this is correct.
