I remember in a booklet from Kodak on their Ektachrome IR film, there was a
picture
of a forearm where all the veins were made clearly visible.  This film is near 
infrared (if I remember, the red color on the film corresponds to around
1100 nm).

Veins and artery identification might be possible, maybe, since fingerprint
identification is possible.  A friend of mine developped a quite functionnal 
algorithm doing just that in the late eighties.  OTOH, the blood vessels
patterns are probably much more constant, from individual to individual,
than fingerprints.  Just correct me if I am wrong.
