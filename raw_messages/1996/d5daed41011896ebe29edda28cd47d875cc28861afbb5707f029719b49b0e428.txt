Just generate a stream of octets by running DES (or some other block
cipher) in the following mode:

C_-1 = IV
C_n = E_K(C_n-1)

i.e., start by encrypting the IV with your key, and thereafter generate a
block by encrypting the previous block with your key. Here the IV is
essentially part of the key.

XOR the resulting bits (or octets) with your plaintext to generate an
encrypted stream. Remember within your cipher's state the current output
block and how much of it you've used.

Note that if you reuse a key, you'll enable attacks that rely on the fact
that similar messages will produce similar ciphertext.
