Rich, I don't think it nearly so clear as you are claiming. The definition
of fascism, that is. Without resorting to the usual ploy of quoting
Webster's (a ploy I usually am not impressed by), let me cite an
"anti-fascist" radio personality, Dave Emory, who I have been listening to
nearly every week for several years.

Dave is undeniably anti-fascist, an unusual mixture of left-leaning views
and National Rifle Association sympathies, and he often quotes Mussolini's
famous "Fascism is corporatism" line. That is, a view more similar to Bruce
Baugh's point that fascism is primarily an economic theory, about the
organization and ownership of production systems, than about hatred of any
particular ethnic group.

It is certainly true that Italian and German fascism (and the important
variant of "national socialism") become intertwined with certain forms of
racism, with which we are all familiar, but I don't think Bruce is at all
wrong in his definition of fascism. That Hitler and his group combined
fascist economic theories with occultist views of racial superiority does
not mean the two viewpoints are identical.

("Fascism is corporatism" is of course not an overall indictment of all
corporations. "Corporatism" is basically a view that government should
identify key industries and corporations and then pick the winners and
support them while suppressing their competitors. This oversimplifies what
Mussolini, Emory, myself, etc. mean by "corporatism," but I hope this gives
at least a glimpse. And we could get off into discussions of "state
capitalism" and how the Soviet and Chinese forms of government were
essentially examples of "state capitalism," but this would be a long and
involved debate.)

My high school teachers failed to mention much of anything, but this was
hardly surprising to me--I never expected them to. Fortunately, I knew how
to read, and so I learned all of these things. (Except for Pound, whom I
didn't encounter until my first year in college.)
