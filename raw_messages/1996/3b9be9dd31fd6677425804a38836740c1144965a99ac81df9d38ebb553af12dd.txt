Reality Check

Everyone knows that you can't predict the future.
The question is: Can traditional economics understand
the present?

Not too many years ago, on the eve of the collapse
of the Soviet Union, the leading economics textbook
had this to say:

"The Soviet economy is proof that, contrary to what
many skeptics had earlier believed, a
socialist command economy can function and
even thrive."

                      -- Paul A. Samuelson, Professor emeritus, MIT
                       (in Samuelson & Nordhaus, Economics, 1989)

We wonder what "conventional wisdom" of 1996
will prove to be as, ummm, quotable in the not too
distant future.
