Just got off of MS IE3 download page. To retrieve the 128-bit version, 
they've got a perl script asking for a remote address and a host address 
via a pair of cookies. Unfortunately, it chokes *every single time* it's 
invoked on my system, and shows me a 1-800 number (terminally busy) to 
call.

Has anyone either managed to download it, or gotten through to the 1-800 
number? I'd _really_ like a copy of the 128-bit version. I'm a U.S. 
citizen, live here in Amarillo, TX.

Anyone from MicroSloth reading this *might* want to let a Responsible 
Person know about the perl script hiccups....
