	Given what I've picked up (including what institutions he's chosen to
deal with, the behavior of these institutions - MTB's dropping of merchants
disapproved of by Mrs. Grundy et al, and other information), I am willing to
bet that the second is the priority. Once his patents run out, all bets are
off... but it looks like he's wanting to get ecash accepted before then.
Otherwise, everyone may be using various non-anonymous (or GAKed anonymous)
methods like credit card encryption.
	Unless I'm reading the ecash protocols wrong, using the current version
of the software some degree of payee anonymnity is possible.
