Such a claim is bogus.  "existing law" already "applies" to new technology.  
It's just that this only means that cops think they have a right to wiretap. 
 It does not mean that they are able to usefully understand the meaning of 
what they hear.

But is the average citizen substantially impacted by crimes that would be 
assisted by good encryption?  Probably not.

She forgot to mention REVOLUTION.

I see no need for a "balance."  I think that the advent of good encryption 
has the effect of increasing the security of individuals.

Maybe she should have said, "without toppling the government-employed 
parasites from their positions of power."

Another one of those organizations threatened by media-bypass.
