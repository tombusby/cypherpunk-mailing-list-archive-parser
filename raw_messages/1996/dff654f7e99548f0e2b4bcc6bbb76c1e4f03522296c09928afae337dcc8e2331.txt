I'm very interested in figuring out how to refine the user instructions for
Matt's pseudonymizer at alpha, and similar anonymity/pseudonymity systems.

Let me quote what I think are the relevant parts of Matt's standard
instructions, without further comment from me for now. Please point out
anywhere you see a gap or something confusing so we can figure out how to
improve the instructions.

To create a mail alias, first create an encrypted reply-block for a
cypherpunk-style remailer.  An encrypted reply block is a message
encrypted with a remailer's PGP public key, which will be sent to
your address, or to an address where you can receive messages.

To create a reply block, you would create a message for a remailer that
goes back to you:

 ::
 Request-Remailing-To: you@yoursite.org

Then you would encrypt that with a remailer's public key, and prepend
the necessary Encrypted: PGP header.  When this message is received by
a remailer, it would decrypt it and send it to you.  It would also send
you any text appended to the end (outside the PGP wrapper).  Thus, using
a reply block, it is possible for people to send you mail without knowing
your real address.

Next, choose a pseudonym and a password.  The pseudonym-address may contain
any alphabetical or numeric characters, or hyphens.  The password may not
contain any spaces.  Then create a message of the following format:

 From: yourname@alpha.c2.org
 Password: Your_Password
 Reply-Block:
 ::
 Anon-To: remailer@utopia.hacktic.nl
 
 ::
 Encrypted: PGP

 -----END PGP MESSAGE-----

Do not actually indent it.  It is indented here because some people's
mailers try to auto-decrypt PGP messages and this is just an example.

Encrypt this with the following public key and mail it to
alias@alpha.c2.org.  Unencrypted mail sent to this address
will be deleted automatically.  If everything is correct, your
mail alias will be created, and you will be sent a confirmation.
If not, there will be no way for the software to reply to you,
so the message will be deleted.  If you don't receive anything,
something is wrong, so try again.  Be sure to test the reply
block first, so that you will know it works!  Also, don't forget
to include the address of the remailer, and the Encrypted: PGP
header at the beginning of your reply block.

Sending in a new reply-block replaces the old one.  To change your
reply-block, just send a new one, using the same format as
the above message.
