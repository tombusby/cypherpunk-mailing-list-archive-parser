:Subject: [EFG] GA law criminalizing Spam cancels??
----------snip----------
:Electronic Frontiers Georgia has engaged the law firm of Bondurant, Mixson, 
:& Elmore (specifically Scott McClain) to look into a court challenge of 
:HB1630 "The Internet Police Law" which goes into effect on July 1st.  We see 
:this as an unecessary and badly framed law.
:
:This law would appear to make it a Georgia criminal act to remove spam & 
:spews from newsgroups.  This is law OCGA 16-9-93.1
:
:Some information can be found at
:
:    http://ninja.techwood.org/~efg/
:
:under the "Day the sites went out in Georgia" section.
:
:My understanding, and the perception of spammers seems to be that in order 
:to cancel a message, you must forge headers to become that person, thereby 
:falsely identifying yourself.  This seems to be in direct violation of the law
:
:  It shall be unlawful for any person, ... to transmit any data 
:  through a computer network ... if such data uses any individual 
:  name, ... to falsely identify the person, ...

Spamming aside, this strikes at my privacy and choice of anonymity.
