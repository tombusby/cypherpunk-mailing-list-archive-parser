Some code comes from random sources; signatures there mainly buy you 
the ability to blame someone if the code hoses your machine,
and thus reduces the chance that someone will hose you.

But as Java develops, there'll be more commercial code available;
I'd trust Java code signed by Microsoft just as much as I'd
trust any other Microsoft code I'm running on my machines.
Maybe more, given the quality of some of the Microsoft code I'm
running now :-)
