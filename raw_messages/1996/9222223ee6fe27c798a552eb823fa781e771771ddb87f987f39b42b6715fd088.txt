Delete it at will.

Cookies are small tidbits of information that server side CGI progs (and
client side JavaScript progs) have saved. Cookies are generally used to
identify web users when they return to a site. I've seen cookies named
"lastvisit", "userid", and so on. If pathfinder.com creates a cookie, it is
only visible to pathfinder.com (that's the theory anyway). 

Deleting the cookie.txt file will have no ill effects unless you are using
one of those "build yer own Start Pages" at MSN or wherever. Altering
cookies would send garbage down when the cookie is requested.

If you would rather that cookies (and crumb trails) not be allowed simply
delete any cookies present and make the nominal file read only.

John.
