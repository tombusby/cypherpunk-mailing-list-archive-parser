A paperless office is about as useful as a paperless bathroom.

Try using Ghostscript and Ghostview.  There are versions for both 16 bit and
32 bit Windows. (As well as about every other platform on the planet.)  They
will allow you to display PostScript files to your screen, as well as print
them to non-postscript printers.  (But being a paperless office, you
probibly don't have printers...)

Information on Ghostview and GhostScript can be found at:
