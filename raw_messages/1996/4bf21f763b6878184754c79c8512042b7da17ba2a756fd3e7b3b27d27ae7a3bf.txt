It has always seemed somewhat amusing that we will have a) a widespread opinion
that homeschooling is of lesser value and b) numerous studies, surveys,
testimonials, reports, etc, that show what a rotten job public education is
doing*.   This raises the question of how anyone even remotely concerned with
their children's welfare could do worse. . .    Yet another unexplained mass
insanity.

* - I can add to the testimonial side of things here. I'm one of those rare
teenagers who went straight to the professional workplace (bypassing college),
but it's in spite of the best effort of our educational system, especially the
so-called GATE programs (Gifted & Talented Education - more like stultification
from my experience in 3 widely separate districts) or honors classes.  They're
real big on the "touchy-feely" but actual academic performance lags.  My
physics teacher was actually expected to teach AP level physics to a bunch of
students who hadn't even had Algebra 2. (I never took Calculus, but that didn't
prevent me from understanding a derivative or integral)  I won't even rant
about the English classes where a 400 page book (about 1.5 hours for me) is a
semester's reading...
