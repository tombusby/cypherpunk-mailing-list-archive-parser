The basic idea of digital postage means, as Lucky said, that individual
users and individual messages would have their own stamps. (Being just
numbers, it is certainly possible that multiple messages could have the
same exact "stamp," but then only one of them would be valid...in the model
I usually think in terms of, the first to "redeem" the stamp gets the
money, all others get nothing.)

So, each transmitter of a message would have to "pay the freight" with his
own stamp. The idea of N different messages all carrying the "same" stamp
is inconsistent with how digital postage would operate in practice.

Yes.

Yes.

I think someone tried this a couple of years ago, offering coupons for
remailer use.

The idea of "coupons" acting as stamps is the one most often discussed as
an alternative to having full convertability to money. A person buys a
block of numbers, each can be used once and only once. It's up to the user
not to let the numbers out of his possession (as they can be used by
whoever gets them).

So long as the numbers are in the outer encrypted envelope, packet sniffers
and sysadmins won't see them.

So long as the remailer operator is honest enough not to claim the numbers
have already been used--a reasonable assumption, at least at this
time--then this should work.

Coupons also get around laws about cash, banking, etc.
