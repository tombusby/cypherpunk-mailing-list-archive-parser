You're talking about the 6th amendment confrontation clause.  Really, 
that's unrelated to requests for production of documents via the 
subpoena process, which is more related to the due process clause.

Like I said in a related message, I have seen fines of $75,000 a day leveled 
against "bad faith" third parties for not complying with grand jury 
subpoenas for documents.

Unfortunately, this is incorrect.  Subpoena power is immensely potent in 
the United States, and is arguably the most violent extraterratorial 
exercise of American sovreignty there is.

It's no different than a safety deposit box.  The bank is hardly going to 
endure prosecution and significant for withholding lawful access to a 
defendant's safety deposit box.

And Ohio never joined the union and thus is a tax haven, yadda, yadda, yadda.

Please.

They are as "subpoena-able" as the escrow agent is unwilling to bear the 
burden of multi-million dollar fines and the defendant unwilling to bear 
the burden of incarceration.

You know, I didn't know who was writing this message until I got down 
here and my screen scrolled, but I had my suspicions.
