I have a CDR sitting right next to me and this is how it handles your
questions:
1) This CDR can burn in 4 modes: 
  1. ISO xxxx compliant (without trailing version numbers on filenames),
  2. strict DOS 8.3,
  3. Joliet (DOS 8.3 & Win95 up to 63 chars),
  4. Romeo (strict Win95 up to 128 chars).
According to the help, option 1 is made to be at least Mac readable.  It
doesn't mention UNIX, though.
2) Yes.
3) No problem: use this CDR.

If you want info on the particular CDR, email me personally.
