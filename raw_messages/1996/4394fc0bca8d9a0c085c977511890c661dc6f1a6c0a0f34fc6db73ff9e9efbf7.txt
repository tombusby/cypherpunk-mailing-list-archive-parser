Steganography still seems to be useful.  However, I don't think total
absence of physical security will last for long.  Soon school children will
be carrying their own portables, the way they now carry calculators.  They
will have private time alone with the hardware the same way their parents
will.  Parents and children divided into "armed camps" has always been a
lousy way to run a family.  Computers are just a new battle ground for
families that chose to run that way.
