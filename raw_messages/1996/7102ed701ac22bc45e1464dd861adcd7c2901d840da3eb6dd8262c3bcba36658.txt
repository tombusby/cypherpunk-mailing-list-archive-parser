HI!
Please look at our web address; http://www.sfmc.com
We are information security technoligy through encyption, compresion, error
correction and we are compatible with any open network or electronic mailing
system. We use a public/private key approach. We work on Windows/DOS platform.
The gentleman, DR. Vladyslave Oleynik, who created this software moved to
The Research Triangle Park from St. Petersburg, Russia. His unique
mathematical approach gives this software the longest encryption key length
on the market today. This software also offers compression of up to 85% of
all computer generated files as well as correct statistical errors up to 30%
in a file.Because of its encryption strength, the highest compression on the
market today, its error correction capability that no one else offers, and
it is one of the easiest to use, this Russian technoligy will prove to
change the standard of software security as we know it. Our E-mail address
is safemail@nternet.net
