CALL FOR PAPERS


Multimedia Data Security

Part of IS&T/SPIE's 1997 Symposium on
Electronic Imaging: Science & Technology
8-14 February 1997
San Jose Convention Center
San Jose, California   USA

Conference Chair: Taher Elgamal, Netscape Communications

The growth of the use of public networks as the platform for multimedia
applications in the past year has made it important to devise mechanisms for
ensuring proper use of intellectual property, and increased the importance
of employing security mechanisms for video and audio data. This conference
will serve as a forum for the exchange of ideas in the areas of security
systems and mechanisms especially in applications that handle large data
volumes.

Papers are solicited in all areas of security systems and algorithms
including but not limited to:

* security systems for imaging applications
* security systems for real-time video applications
* performance studies and comparisons for securing image data
* watermarking and detection of fraudulent copying of intellectual property
* metering schemes for intellectual property usage
* audio and video encryption mechanisms
* key management and security protocols for broadcast applications
* payment systems for online multimedia applications
* content protection mechanisms for online multimedia distribution.

This conference is just one of nearly 30 conferences to be held at the EI'97
symposium. And EI'97 is one of 4 collocated symposia (Electronic Imaging,
Biomedical Optics, Lasers and Applications, and Optoelectronics).
