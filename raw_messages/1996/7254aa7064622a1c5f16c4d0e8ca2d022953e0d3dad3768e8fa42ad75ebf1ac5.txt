I thought this was rather amusing... it's labeled as humor, so maybe 
people won't flame me for posting it... :)

The Schwa Corperation, Global Media and Infomation Services is proud
to present "Intrude", the search engine for the next century.  Intrude
is working 24 hours a day, sucking infomation and carefully indexing
data from all four corners of the global infosphere.  Sure, other
search engines scan Usenet and mailing list archeives... but Intrude
goes even further.  Using the powerful parallel-processing supercomputer,
"Pal 4000" (courtesy of Schwa Microsystems Computer Corperation), Intrude
reads credit ratings, cable TV viewing habits, mail-order products received,
videos rented, parking tickets received, and of course, every single
peice of email transmitted over the Internet.  Tired of those pesky
PGP messages?  They are no match for Pal's Reverse Escrow Orthoganal
decryption software.  

But don't feel bad about knowing that everything you ever said online
is now available to any crazy with a 14.4, all search querries on Intrude
are logged also... so you can always Intrude the person Intruding on you.

Try Intrude today, and see what juice facts it pulls up.  You might learn
things about yourself you never knew!

"The Schwa Corperation, making information work harder... and harder
infomation to work... or working infomation hard"
