The SSN isn't there for tracking you down in case of fraud.
It's there because the IRS insists they collect it on interest-bearing accounts
so they can tax you.  Your driver's license, if they ask for that,
is something they want to see for fraud prevention, because that's
harder to fake than an SSN.  And your SSN is a perfectly appropriate thing
to use with a key-centered approach: "This is my SSN, please use it for my
bank account",
signed key 123456789.
