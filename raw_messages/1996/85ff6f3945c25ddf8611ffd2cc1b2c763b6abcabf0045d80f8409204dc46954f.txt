OK.  I suppose I deserved this -- I didn't make the leap from "MD5" to digest
access authentication.  I've studied up now.  Still, as you say, digest
authentication won't protect the password modification scenario.

This, on the other hand, was both uncalled-for and incorrect.  Netscape
browsers certainly do account for a large majority of the total browsers.
If a solution doesn't work with Netscape, most people would agree that it
isn't "useable by a large number of browsers".  And, in any case, Netscape
is not the only browser to implement SSL.  Several other commercial
browsers also claim to support SSL and I have even heard that there is a
version of Mosaic that uses SSLeay.

SHTTP might be better if it didn't have to be "useable by a large number
of browsers" -- since Netscape doesn't support SHTTP.  (I'm sorry that you
apparently find Netscape's success so frustrating, but it is a fact.)
