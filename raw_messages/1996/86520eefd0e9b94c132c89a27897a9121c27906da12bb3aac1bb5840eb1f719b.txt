After 4 years of killing?  I wouldn't be surprised, although what you say 
sounds like an exaggeration.  But that's four years of NON-AP conditions.  
Don't blame AP for problems caused by NON-AP practice.

Actually, I think I did, although I'll spell it out in more detail since 
it's so easy.  If looked at on a "per-dollar-stolen" basis, an individual 
would have no more reason to kill a given politician than a criminal.  
However, since politicians are typically responsible for thousands of times 
more theft than common criminal,  this will result in a vastly greater 
motivation.  For example, in the US, 535 Federal legislators preside over $1 
trillion in thefts, or about $2 billion per legislator.  If only 1/1000 of 
that money were spent to eliminate the problem, that would be $2 million 
per-legislator bounty, which should be far more than enough.

That doesn't bother me at all.  It is the contribution system which will 
decide who the likely targets will be, not the killers themselves.  If 
anything, an ex-KKK person would have far less desire to lynch a random 
black, for example, if instead he can make thousands of dollars killing 
genuine bad-guys.

Except that the current political system is far worse.  The system has been 
hijacked by a small subset of the population, who manipulate it for their 
own benefit.  Once in control, it became in their interest to vastly 
increase the power and influence of government, which they did in America 
over the last 80+ years.  AP provides the prospect of making control of 
government useless and even potentially fatal, eliminating much of the 
corruption that is normally seen.  I think people will reject AP only to the 
extent that they misunderstand it.

In addition, one of the benefits of living in a world with many different 
countries is that each may try out a different system, with the successful 
ones tending to prosper, and the less successful ones dying off.  (Witness 
1989 and Communism, for example.)    I contend that the first society to 
adopt AP will be so dramatically successful, it'll spread inexorably.  
That's why the people in control of the current political systems will want 
to resist AP so strenuously.

All you're saying is that the people who are currently in power will resist. 
 I know that.  But they will fail.

No, not nearly enough politicians have been killed in Columbia to result in 
a society that could best be described as an "anarchy."
