tcmay's approach is elegant, and it's refreshing to find a practical use 
for AI approaches.  I think it needs one more step, though.  If we learn 
to quantify our trust in a key, we still need to know what the threshold 
should be for a given application.  Maybe I can get by with a 0.05 Bel 
for posting to cypherpunks, but maybe I want a 0.95 for a monetary 
transaction.  Seems to need a comprehensive risk management approach,
