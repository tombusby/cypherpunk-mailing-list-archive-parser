The Ecash(tm) Software Developer's Kit is available now for
download from "http://www.digicash.com/api".  The major
improvement it that it now _accepts_ payments as well as makes
them.  Accounts at the "Beta Research Bucks" Bank 
(dc.digicash.com:9666) are available upon request.


Here's the README:


- ----- begin included README -----

Announce!

This is the second beta release of the Ecash(tm) Software
Developer's Kit.  It includes:


* the beta 2 release of ecashlib
* a simple test client with source code for reference
* a simple TCP/IP library for use with the test client


Changes since the last release:

* Importantly: The EC_pocket_begin_accept_payment() function
    works.
* Unimportantly: Some internals got upgraded.
    EC_main_get_ver_string() implemented.  Some parameters moved
    from EC_pocket_new() to EC_pocket_begin_open_account(),
    which is their natural habitat.  A small bug or two was 
    squelched.
