WELllllll Id hate to say.... but after coming across A LOT of different users
from both systems.. It has seemed to me that... IN GENERAL, Mac users are
more computer 'illiterate' seeing as the mac's ease of use. Fine for the
everyday person... but not for me. 
Secondly.....as far os the computers software are concerned...... Not much
beats winNT => windows=> PC
THe chips arent 'too' much different. and that leaves me to say..... There's
more PC's out there... which seeing as whats presented..... Leads me to
thinks PC's are 'better' in my eyes.
So... how baout those mets?
