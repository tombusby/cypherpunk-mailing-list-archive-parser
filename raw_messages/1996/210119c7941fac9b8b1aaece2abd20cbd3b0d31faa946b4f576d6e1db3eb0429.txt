It doesn't give any details, though. The general size of the NSA
budget was known for a long time based on inference -- see "The Puzze
Palace".

In any case, they are not now making a habit of releasing budget
numbers, but you can find out how much they in general
spend. Certainly the original poster's request for detailed quarterly
reports isn't going to be met...
