I don't agree with this.  I expect everyone who handles viruses to know
what they're doing and take precautions.  By handling the virus at all
you are effectively claiming such expertise, as I see it.  The court
needn't consider formal training at all.  A "reasonable person" ought
to know if his training is adequate, after all.  The court may choose
to examine this claim, and find it to be in error, thus making the
handling of the virus reckless.  If the court accepts the claim, then
it should examine the actual procedures.  If the procedures are found
wanting, there is negligence (though I suspect my "non-legalese" usage
of these terms has them reversed --- negligence is a worse fault, in my
estimation: you had the knowledge but failed to act in accordance with
it; recklessness means you acted without fully appreciating the
consequences, and thus didn't know better.)

I guess "trained" may have been inappropriate.  How about "knowledgable"?

Formal training implies that one is knowledgable, but such knowledge
may be acquired without formal training (or new fields would never come
about).  Certain actions are clearly acceptable for knowledgable people
but are dangerous for those without the knowledge --- handling a
biological virus is one of them.

The court need to nothing more than determine whether the precautions
were adequate.

I'm not sure I'm imposing stricter negligence on trained CPR types, see
my comments below.  What I *am* doing is imposing a stricter
recklessness standard on untrained types.

Doing the wrong thing willfully is reckless or even malicious.

But is it actionable?  Doesn't the law have a sort of "no harm, no
foul" interpretation?  According to Holmes, if I believe that an enemy
is trying to kill me, and I arrange things so that when he thinks he's
shooting me, he's really shooting a mannekin, he has *not* committed
attempted murder.  Similarly, if a pickpocket puts his hand in my
pocket, but there's nothing there, he hasn't committed a crime.

The expert shouldn't get reduced liability for this.  The 'idiot' is
effectively a tool in the expert's hands.  Too, the 'idiot' has no
way of assuring himself that the supposed expert is, in fact, qualified.
It's no more appropriate for him to administer CPR under the guidance
of a stranger than to do it on his own judgement.

Dunno.  Is it "reasonable" for an untrained person to attempt CPR?  That's
for a court to decide.

Actually, I'd say the error in this abortion argument is that there's
a presumption of guilt, which runs counter to a basic tenet of common
law.

In the virus case, I'd expect the plaintiff/prosecutor to prove that
the precautions were inadequate.  Not merely that they were ineffective
in the specific case, but that a "reasonable person" would have known
the activity to be dangerous without adequate precautions, and that a
"resonable expert" would have considered the precautions taken
inadequate.  Without such proof, the defendant need only indicate
what precautions were taken, and claim that they are adequate.

I see it the other way around.  The "objective" reasonable standard
says "don't handle the virus unless you're and expert".  Handling the
virus and being found incompetent to do so (the idiot case) means
you're reckless and subject to those punitive damages.  Being found
competent to handle them and found not to have taken adequate steps
leaves you at least negligent, but reckless if it wasn't accidental.
Competent with adequate precautions means you weren't even negligent.

Precautions don't necessarily eliminate danger, they simply reduce it
to acceptable levels.  Licensed drivers are, in some sense, driving
experts.  Why do they get in accidents?  Often because of liability,
but often there are merely unpredictable circumstances --- junk in the
road, sudden ice storms, etc.  The burden of proving negligence must
remain with the one claiming injury.

It's a faulty assumption, and a common law court ought to stick to its
philosophical origins --- innocent until proven guilty.
