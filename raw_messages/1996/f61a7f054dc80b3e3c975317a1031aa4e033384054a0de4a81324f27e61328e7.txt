Dole says he would fix the ITAR problem, but try to keep something like
CDA. 

Clinton is keeping ITAR and signed CDA.  But not having the religious
right he might soften on CDA.

The courts seem to be throwing out CDA much faster than ITAR (some fast
track to the supreme court built into the law).  It also seems like ITAR
is the more important thing to fix (it is easier to move pornography etc
out of the US than major software companies). 

So it seems Dole is the better vote.  Is this important enough to many
cypherpunks to actually determine their vote?
