Actually, I never said that.  Anyone may.  I may hire only white people
(even with the intent not to hire others).  I will also pay the
consequences.  And if someone feels that they need to do this, the teachers
of civil disobedience indeed state it is their duty to.

Anyone may give their money to whomever they choose.  I was simply stating
it was morally wrong.

I have never been ashamed of my opinions.  Its just that I never said they
couldn't do it.  I justify my position as follows:

It is costly to everyone in the state to have areas of under and
unemployment, poverty and usually high-crime rates.

It is unjust and costly to deny opportunity based upon residence.

It is just and efficient to allow markets to indeed be free instead of
falsely supporting a certain hegemony based upon residence.

Free and full competition is the only way to achieve a free market.  This
can only happen when access to capital is equal with regard to worthless
indicators (race, sex, residence and aga's favorite, sexual orientation).

I have never suggested that provably bad credit risks should be given money.

It does if my argument is that this part of the system *is* just.  I
realize you disagree, but I am sure you are not dismissing my argument
out-of-hand.  If you disagree, as you say, then disagree.

I agree.  I am not arguing that we need to withdraw Title VII.  Aparently
you are?

Why are you stepping around your opinion?  "...if that is in fact what has
happened."  Just say it.  You do not believe poor people are
disenfranchised.  I understand the ramifications of "no possible recourse".
 How should poor people save money?  Through some forms of civil
disobedience like stealing food and clothes and then putting that money in
the bank?  Of course, the police will understand.  The government will back
them.

Look, capital begets capital.  I favor increasing opportunity.  As I will
discuss below, there are reasons why capital does not flow to poor areas.

I thought that it didnt matter where people came from as long as the risk
was low in reality.  Banks weed through the people coming to them from the
suburbs.  Is it harder for them to see past a red line?  More costly?  How?
 It is too much trouble because of the way that bankers think.

It also screws up the market.  I am glad that you admit that racism is
irrational.  That is the core as to why the problem doesnt go away.  It is
an infinite loop.  Current interests wont go there.  Generally, people who
understand the problem are without access to capital.  They would like to
go there.  They cant get capital.  When they approach current interests,
they wont go there.

There are a few examples of people who actually realize this as a
problem/opportunity.  Oddly enough, this point reinforces mine.  Redlining
did exist.  Bank of America realized it and made a lot of money.  But it
still exists elsewhere.  Why dont business plans around the country spring
up on venture capitalists desks with an approved stamp on them?

Ahhh.  This is the key (which I probably did not make as clear as I should
have).  They wont.  It is a bit irrational, I know.  But we just discussed
irrationality.  Racism doesnt see green.  If it did, I agree with you that
capital would flow there.  It doesnt.

I agree with you that it is a financially attractive proposition.  At the
Center for Public Representation where I worked during Law School we
approached investors.  The ROI was extremely attractive not to mention the
added "goodwill" in a largely liberal community (I went to Law School in
Madison, Wisconsin).  No one bit.  Hmm?

Actually, I am very glad you brought it up because I was just going to.
Microloans are successful not only in this country but in India and around
the world as well.  The Grammeen Bank initiated its microloan program in
India by loaning usually less than $100 to individuals.  They fixed up
their residences or started extremely small businesses.  The default rate
was less than 5%.  (BTW, the system also encouraged community by a system
of cyclical neighborhood lending where neighbors took responsibility for
neighbors).  

Compare this now to people whom banks would generally consider a good risk.
 College Graduates.  Generally, these folks live outside of the red line.
Good risks right?  What about those nasty student loan default rates?  The
red lines dont make business sense.

I favor the elimination of illogical regulation.  I favor ridding banks of
burdensome personal property taxes.  Hopefully the deregulation set for
1997 will help.  My desire for regulation in this case is to eliminate
redlining.  It is far more burdensome to retain this system than it would
be to eliminate it.

I wish it were this easy.  Economically depressed areas need new structures
built.  The current structure adds to the cycle of poverty.  First,
earnings are low.  Second, costs are high (Warehouse foodstores dont locate
there so corner stores become the means of feeding the family ($$$)).
Again, business plans have been presented to no avail.  Even private
foundation subsidized events were tried.  To no avail.

I am aware of this.  But drug dealers hold more cash than CEO's.  Aparently
the laundromat isnt open for everyone. ;-)

They would not be making as much as they could.  Irrational, I know.

I once believed much like you.  I saw an "opportunity" the existance of
which I could not explain.  It seemed irrational.  And it was.  Racism is
irrational.  As you seem aware (BTW, I applaud you on what seems to be an
honest degree of care) some are trying to break through the cycle.  The
south side of Chicago recently started there own bank.  It is working.  As
you mention, historically, the Bank of America story.  Redevelopment
efforts "seem" to abound.

We agree.  But I feel that a legal elimination of redlining would decrease
costs to the industry.

If they never did we would still have slavery and only white, adult, male,
land-owners would vote.  While success is rare, it has prevailed when the
cause is just.
