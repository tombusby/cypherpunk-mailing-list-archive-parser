On this last point, how is this "encouraging fraud"?

If I deposit money in a bank and choose to identify myself as "Mickey
Mouse, Citizen of the Magic Kingdom," perhaps even presenting a Disneyland
Passport, who is being defrauded?

Is the bank being defrauded? Not if Mickey is depositing money. What if the
bank is _lending_ money to Mickey? Then of course they might find that the
"Magic Kingdom" is not a real country, and that Mickey's "passport" was not
issued by one of the 192 godfearing countries in the United Nations. So
what? Then they deny the loan.

Where is the fraud? Is Anguilla in the business of determining what a True
Name is? (What is it, by the way?) I should remind readers that it is legal
to sell such passports in the U.S....somewhere I have one that says "This
document not good for travel in the People's Republics of Berkeley, Santa
Monica, and Madison," or somesuch.

Again, which specific law in Anguilla specifies which pieces of paper may
be bought and sold? Does the law say an actual crime or case of fraud has
to occur, or is only the potentiality of a crime or fraud involved? Does
the crime or fraud have to occur in Anguilla?

Inquiring minds want to know.
