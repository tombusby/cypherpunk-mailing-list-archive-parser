This is an absurd and inaccurate analogy. The mailBot simply pushes
*mailto:* tags that people have willingly placed on their public websites.
They invite the mail so a more accurate analogy would be that City Hall puts
up a public suggestion box and invites comments. The bot then puts one, and
only one, unsigned anonymous suggestion into the box. It then goes on to the
Art Gallery where they too have put up a public suggestion box, and the bot
places one, and only one, anonymous suggestion in that box also...and it
moves on to the next publicly accessable suggestion box that it finds, each
time putting in one, and only one, message.

Can the College-aged mind these days not develop a rational, concise,
accurate and logical analogy that stays on point?

Think about it... or take down the public suggestion boxes if one doesn't
like what one finds inside. If you invite feedback...it will come.
