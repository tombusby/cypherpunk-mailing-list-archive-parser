Not a big surprise. As we build increasingly secure systems, we shift
the weakest point of the entire system into the realm of physical
access. Honestly, I'm surprised that we don't see this  sort of thing
more often. (Or maybe they're just going undetected.) After all, it is
the weakest point at which a system will be attacked.

Uh-huh. Wouldn't want to cause any kind of a panic among the masses,
would we? Noooo, not when the perception of our super-secure credit
card networks and other financial information infrastructure is at
stake. (And Watergate was a simple bungled burglary, right?)
