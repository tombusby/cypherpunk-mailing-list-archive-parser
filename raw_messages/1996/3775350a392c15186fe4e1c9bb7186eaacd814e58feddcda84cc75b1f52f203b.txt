Note that ViaCrypt is now using its own version numbers.  PGP 4.0 is 
really the same crypto engine as in 2.7.1, but with some new features.

I asked about that, but the answer was indefinite.  I'd say "no."

Yes.  We were one of the beta sites for it.  There are actually two new 
versions of ViaCrypt PGP 4.0:  A business edition and a personal 
edition.  Essentially, there's a bunch more key management features and 
some new windows features.  In the business edition, you can configure it 
so that keys are essentially "escrowed" in that it will always add "the 
company" to the list of recipients.  Thus, your company can read your 
traffic if they want to.  This was at the request of many businesses who 
stated that they wanted to use PGP, but that they needed some means of 
escrowing the keys.

What's really interesting is what ViaCrypt has planned for even later 
releases: support for DSS (and SHA), DES, triple DES, multiple key rings, 
PC Card token support, provision for large key certificate databases, 
integration with X.509 structures, and a high performance single pass 
mode of operation.  

ViaCrypt put up some marketing stuff on their web page.  Try:
