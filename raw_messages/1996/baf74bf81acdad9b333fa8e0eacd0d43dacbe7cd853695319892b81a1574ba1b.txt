Please comment on my (layman's) proposal that no "mens rea" ("guilty mind") can be 
attributed to a person who is relying on a not-yet-overturned judicial 
decision.  In other words, if a person has a genuine belief that what he's 
doing has been upheld by the Patel ruling, he cannot be claimed to have had 
"mens rea."  (I am presuming, here, that before he does anything, he "clears 
it" with a lawyer who assures him that what he's planning is at least 
covered in the Patel decision as being okay.  I understand, of course, that 
"mens rea" may be irrelevant in CIVIL REGULATORY issues, but not in CRIMINAL ones.)

What about leaving a floppy on a sidewalk in Des Moines, Iowa, which might 
be picked up by a wandering foreign tourist who happened nearby?

Sheesh, these judges are real idiots, even when they accidently are coming 
to (mostly) the right conclusion.

However, if being "on the Internet" is automatically presumed to be an 
export, why can't we program using remote-control editors which might, 
someday, be available on the Internet?  (maybe they already are; somewhat 
analogous to the old timesharing computers of yore.  If the underlying files 
were kept overseas, modified by specific editing commands sent to a remote 
system, presumably Patel's dicta would suggest that those files were never 
"exported" per se.  They were formed and kept overseas, INTENTIONALLY, to 
avoid the later necessity of exporting them had they been kept in the US.)  
This would be an modifed and automated version of the way versions of PGP 
later than 1.0 were supposed to have been developed:  Actual coding was done 
overseas, based on suggestions and comments from other countries.  
(including, presumably, the US.)

Yes, realize that pessimism overtakes me here.  "The system" never wants to 
admit a contradiction.  I would argue, however, that whereever the system 
wishes to draw the line and call everything outside the line "an export," 
that decision should be considered binding on the government even when such 
a conclusion leads to unexpected and undesireable consequences.  (for the 
government, at least...)

Wouldn't it be more accurate to say that they are no longer considered 
precisely defined exceptions, NOT that the exceptions no longer exist?  

It seems to me that if the "burden of non-ambiguity" falls on those writing 
the regulations, failure to eliminate ambiguity would have to be resolved in 
favor of tolerating actions that fall into the grey area.  For example, if a 
law was passed that said, "pornographic writing is illegal," and the SC 
later determined that "pornographic" was ambiguously defined, what they 
WOULDN'T do is to make ALL writing illegal!  (which would, obviously, be an 
over-broad restriction, in an of itself.)  Otherwise, what would on the 
surface appear to be a overturning of a law would actually be a _broadening_ 
of it.

But again, deal with the mens rea issue.  If Patel said, "It's okay to 
export this software because the regulation is invalid," and you do so 
relying on this ruling, wouldn't any subsequent (criminal)  prosecution both 
have to prove you did it, and ALSO prove that you were being unreasonable in 
relying on the ruling?  (Are rulings of illegality somehow more "reasonable" 
than rulings of legality?)

I'm not suggesting that her decision can't be overturned in the future; I'm 
suggesting that until it is overturned, each member the public is entitled 
to act in reliance on it, perhaps at least the ones in her jurisdiction.

However, wouldn't it be a good idea to take advantage of what is at least a 
temporary decision?  If I were a large corporation, having just developed an 
excellent design for a crypto telephone, I might want to export it NOW, 
which is in effect taking advantage of a temporary loosening of restrictions.
