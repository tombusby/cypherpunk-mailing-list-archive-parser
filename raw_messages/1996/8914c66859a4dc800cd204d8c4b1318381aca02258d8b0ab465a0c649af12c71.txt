Depends on the computers one uses, and who you are computing with. 
I've heard some horror stories of people using PGP modified to handle 
4kbit or 8kbit keys on 286s that waited <i>days</i> to generate keys 
and hours to sign or decrypt messages.

If you're exchanging messages with people using fast computers, 
lerger key sizes are practical.  Otherwise you need to take the issue 
of key-size/speed tradoff seriously.

If very improved factoring methods are discovered, it might not 
matter.  If a new method of cryptanalysis against IDEA comes out, 
that might make RSA key-sizes a non-issue.

AFAIK, PGPlib will support multiple public key and private key 
algorithms.
