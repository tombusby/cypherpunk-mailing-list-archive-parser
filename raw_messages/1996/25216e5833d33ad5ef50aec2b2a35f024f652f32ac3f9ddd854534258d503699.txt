What settings do you use in sendmail.cf to accomplish this (sending
it directly)?  Is that the default behavior?  Specifically, what
goes on the "DR" and "DV" lines?  When I send mail from my PPP
account to my work account, I always seem to end up with a "Received:
>From <my ISP's host> by <some intermediate host>" line.  I'm
ass-u-ming that if the host name shows up in the headers, it's
passing through that machine and is potentially being logged.
