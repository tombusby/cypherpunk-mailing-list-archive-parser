Sniffers aren't much effort, and if I sniff your tagged purchases and 
put them out over the net anonymously, they are traced to you.

Probably, but the Billboard article discussed using CC numbers as an 
ID in the online watermarked transactions.  Doesn't mean they were 
correct, of course.

For someone in the misuc counterfit business, the equipment is 
probably not that expensive.  It's innocuous enough (recording and 
editing equipment) that it wouldn't draw suspicion.

AFAIK, most "bootlegging" is of unreleased concerts or out-takes. 
Digital watermarks would be of little use.

I think it's intended for tagging online transactions.  You connect 
to a company's site and download the latest album or single by some 
band, presumably with the rights to transfer that to a tape for 
personal use.

If this becomes a predominant way of buying music or movies in an
eventual future (when most people on the planet are wired) and 
anonymous purchases disappear (I doubt it) as well as radio 
broadcasts (another loophole) die out (quite doubtful as well).

Of course you have to be foolish to pirate under such a system using
your own name.
