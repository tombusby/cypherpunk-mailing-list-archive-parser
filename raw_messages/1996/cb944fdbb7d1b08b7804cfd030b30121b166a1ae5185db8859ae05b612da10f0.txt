like pgpsendmail?

	The big problem with adding SSL or ssh to mail transport is
that both assume that mail goes from host A to host B, with none in
between.  This is useful, but its more useful (IMHO) to integrate something
that doesn't use online key exchange to ensure end to end security.

	Take for example, Alice sends mail to Dave via Brian and
Charlie.  A point to point protocol, while useful against Eve and
Mallet, doesn't address the fact that Brian works for the NSA.  While
if Alice's sendmail encrypts the message to Dave, then Brian and
Charlie are reduced to traffic analysis instead of reading the mail.

	The case of mail being carried by an intermediary is still
pretty large.

	In any event, I don't see an advantage other than buzzwords to
using SSL/SSH over PGP, while I do see advantages to pgp.
