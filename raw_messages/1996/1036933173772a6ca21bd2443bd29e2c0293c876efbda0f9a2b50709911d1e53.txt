A good primer for U.S. citizens on that area of the world can be found 
in a document called "The Opal File - the Round Table financial takeover 
of Australia and New Zealand".  Time period covered is May 1967 to Feb. 
1987.  Names mentioned include:

Hunt, Nelson B.
Muldoon, ? (N.Z. finance minister)
Onassis, Aristotle
Colby, William
Parsky, Gerald
Hand, Michael
Maheu, Robert
Rockefeller, David
Sindona, Michele
Wriston, Walter
McCloy, John J.
Brierly, Ron
Seldon, Bob
Nugan, Frank
Jones, Bob
Fletcher, J.C.

There are many other names, it's a great document, and the size is 
relatively small, about 59 kb.
