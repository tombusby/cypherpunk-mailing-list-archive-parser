I was with you until this.  In fact diamonds are anything but rare.  
Their value is the result of the most exceptional marketing by DeBeers, 
and the very tight restrictions on supply.  I might note that the 
restrictions on supply are even somewhat tangential.  DeBeers has created 
one of the most historic, long standing and impressive market distortions 
anyone has ever seen.

Of course this only goes to further the argument (which I think you are 
adopting) that it is fairly simple to estlablish a commodity of "value" 
regardless of intrinsic worth)

Even gem quality stones are relatively abundant believe it or not.

Again, even absent the intrinsic value of the substance it seems that 
marketing and perception will dictate "effective value."

This is precisely the point, and why, while I agree with your comments 
about gold today, I think the most important issue is the long term 
solvency of a commodity.  As you have noted, anyone can make a substance 
worth something in the short term.  (Tulips)  The challenge, and the 
goal in my view, is to create a currency based on a backing which endures 
the long term, and the unthinkable (collapse of a major government or 
some such).

When the value of the intrinsic worth of a commodity in question does become 
apparent is in periods of transition, flux, disorder, or strife.  The 
security of a currency is going to be a major factor, especially 
immediately following introduction, to its popularity- except in unusual 
circumstances (tulips, market distortions, etc.)

I'm not sure this is precisely true.  While gold itself might not be the 
best choice, the general principal that a commodity based currency is 
less secure or trustworthy than a government backed one (even a powerful 
and imposing government) is not one I'm prepared to endorse without 
reservation.

I believe this correct.

Just like diamonds.
Again, while the commodity itself (gold) may not be appropriate, I don't 
believe this ends the argument.

Which suggests that private currencys must utilize e-cash (if at all) 
merely as monetary instruments which continue to look much like what 
exists today.  (e.g., drafts, checks, bonds...)

Yet here I must differ.  I'm still not convinced that a legitimate 
commodity somewhat resistant to the market distortions you cite does not 
exist.  Don't ask me what it is yet, I'll have to give it some thought.
