By the way, Matt, thanks for mentioning this on the list.

As this was the second time I'd seen this, I was about to send you a short
note mentioning that your requests to John's bot were also going to the
list (in case you didn't know). I suspect at least 5 or maybe 10 others
were thinking about doing the same thing.

So, your acknowledgement helps. (This is the same reason I think most
replies ought to be public, as this one will be: it signals others that a
reply has been made. Standard game theory arguments.)
