That patch doesn't work.  It will always return an error.  I have tested the
following patch and it does work as intended:

*** premail.orig	Wed Oct 30 22:25:10 1996
--- premail	Sat Dec 21 15:45:41 1996
***************
*** 3631,3636 ****
--- 3631,3639 ----
      $invoc .= ' > '.$ps;
      $invoc .= ' 2> '.$errfile;
      &pdv ("Invoking PGP as $invoc\n");
+     if(-e $ps) {
+ 	&error ("Premail secrets file already exists\n");
+     }
      $status = &open_pgp ($invoc, $pass, '');
      $err = &read_and_delete ($errfile);
      &pdv ($err);

Sorry about the previous mistake.
