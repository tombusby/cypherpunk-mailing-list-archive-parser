Or enough magnetic tape or CD-R to pre-compute a lookup table,
accessible via the Internet? Hmm, taking one byte and running it
through 2^40 keys will produce exactly 1024GB values. Mag tape
is dollars / megabyte: it seems possible to take a known clear
text (like "cypherpunks") and compute a lookup table that would
take a look at the encryption and list the key(s) that match.
