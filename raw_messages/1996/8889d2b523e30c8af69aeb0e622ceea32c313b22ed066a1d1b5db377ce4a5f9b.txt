Actually, they're in very common usage today.

Uh, no.  See, the problem is that the (long)transmission fiber has even more 
attenuation at about 980 nm (the "pump wavelength) than about 1500, the 
wavelength of interest.  It is necessary to generate and apply the power at 
the amplifier site.

They are!  Truly amazing technology.  It's like a "negative-loss" cable.  
Invented about 10 years ago, and they vastly improved the ability to do LD 
communications through fiber.  Huge bandwidth, compared to current usage.
