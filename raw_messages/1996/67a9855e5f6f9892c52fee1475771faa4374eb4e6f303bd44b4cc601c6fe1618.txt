Denning hasn't thought this through. Do the math.

The diameter of the earth is 12,576 km
The speed of light is about 3e5 km/sec

-> max phase shift to simulate = 42 msec.

This is on roughly the same scale as network delays, or less. 

If you are trying to simulate a location in roughly the same area as your
actual location (say, on the same continent), the max phase shift to simulate is
a lot smaller - probably less than 5 ms.

The site checking the incoming packets for their origin has to allow for
realistic network delays - say 100 -200 ms.

Therefore any site that can see the same set of satellites as the site it is
trying to simulate can do so, buffering less than 50 ms of waveforms and
pretending to be on the end of a slow link.

Denning's plan: A beautiful idea murdered by cold, unfeeling facts.
