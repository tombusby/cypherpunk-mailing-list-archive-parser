But don't forget that you can use a slightly modified protocol to accept
change anonymously, without having to go online!

An IOU is equivalent to a coupon.  You could even implement it as ecash
issued by the merchant, but why?  Using the "change" protocol, you can
do it with real ecash just as easily.  It's just as hard to get an
HP48 to check the signature on change coins returned by the merchant as it
is to check the signature on the IOU.

An HP48 is unlikely to be able to do 768-bit RSA operations.  However,
it could easily have coins stored on it, transmitted to the store via
a convenient IR port, or an RS232 connection.  It's quite straightforward;
if I had a store, I'd do it myself...
