Why not the free market rate the programmers.  Have a software
distribution/payment collection system which requires that the programmer
get a completion bond from a 3rd-part insurance company.  If the programmer
fails to deliver as promised and/or on-time the donding company pays the
'investors' back in full. Since the bonding company's money would be at
risk, if the programmer failed to deliver, they have every incentive to
conservatively rate the programmers/companies offering ot build SW to spec.

Yes, Eric Hughes proposed a broad and structured proposal primarily
addressing this manner of market funding for software development (and
possibly suitable for other intellectual property creation) at DEFCON IV.
My previous comments on completion bonds were taken from his presentation.
