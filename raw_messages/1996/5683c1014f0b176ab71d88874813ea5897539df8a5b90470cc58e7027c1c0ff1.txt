On certain political newsgroups (perhaps most noticeably in the
soc.culture.* heirarchy) it's common to see someone's views refuted
because they are identified with a particular interest group.  The
"result" of the argument is suspect simply because it may be considered
favourable to the author's interest-group, the (sometimes rigourous)
argument /justification is pushed aside in the rush to malign another's
contention.  Anonymity serves as a barrier for some of these conjecturous
refutations (though there is a loss of credibility associated with an
anonymous post as well).  In certain other cases, someone may wish to keep
their employer ignorant of their political beliefs.  Then there are all
the cases where one wishes to keep sexual-orientation (or anything else
considered private), membership in an organization from others. There is
no doubt that anonymity is an extremely valuable position to occupy (and
an important option to keep open for everyone).  Of course we tend to hear
of the "bad" uses to which remailers are put.

Anything labeled "NEW" and/or "IMPROVED" isn't.  The label means the
price went up.  The label "ALL NEW", "COMPLETELY NEW", or "GREAT NEW"
means the price went way up.
