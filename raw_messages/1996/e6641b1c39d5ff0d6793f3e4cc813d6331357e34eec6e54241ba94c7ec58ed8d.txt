Yes.  We are planning to ship this effect with 3.5 version of Razor
next month. Not only does it remove the clients from your schedule but 
from your entire life using an advanced form of pattern recognition.  We 
need to get this approved by the bureau of tobacco and firearms before we 
are allowed to start shipping it though, because in some places its 
considered a munition.  Once approved we  hope we can open our market to 
annoyed people in other fields too.
