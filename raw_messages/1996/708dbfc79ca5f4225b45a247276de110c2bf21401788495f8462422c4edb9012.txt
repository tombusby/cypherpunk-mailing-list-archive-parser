This may sound like a clueless newbie question, but then it pretty much
_is_, redeemed only by the fact that I know it. :-)

Following a lead provided by another local newbie, I've been doing a bunch
of amateur remailer testing, looping messages from here through a given
remailer to a nym server, back through the remailer, to here, and toting up
the travel times.

The latency and reliability figures I'm getting bear little or no
resemblance to the info included with Private Idaho, discussed here, and
like that.

Question: is this anything to be concerned about? I'm assuming that the
folks doing ping testing are throwing far more clueful and automated
procedures at the problem, just for starters. But then I get the impression
that their methodology differs from what I'm doing here, too. (My aim was to
simulate "normal" use, at least for me, and to go on to test times through
combos of the most reliable sites later.)
