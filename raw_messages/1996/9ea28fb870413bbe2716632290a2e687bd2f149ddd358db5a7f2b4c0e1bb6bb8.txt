This is practically the least of the concerns.

Assuming one could, say, be paid reliably and without True Name attached,
in a country like Anguilla (to use a current example), it would be simple
enough to fly to Anguilla for a vacation, pick up the money, and return to
the U.S.

I've never had my bags searched on an incoming flight, and even if one is
fearful of this, there are multiple ways to get the cash back.

This is not an ideal, pure crypto anarchist solution, but it certainly
shows that getting the payments made to an offshore account is much more
than half the battle.

(I hear that some consultants to offshore companies are already doing
something like this--they consult for some large fee, e.g., $200K, and then
arrange to be paid out over a period of many years on a contingency basis.
This reduces taxes, at least on this payment, considerably. And they can,
while in Macao, or Singapore, etc., transfer money around the world to
various locales they may visit in the future....)
