[sigh]  Just what I thought, no easy solutions.  Well, for now I'll just
skip signing; I haven't had any problem (that I know of...knock on silicon)
with forged messages, and my normal posts are so enthusiastically anarchical
and inflammatory that the only way anybody could really embarrass me is to
forge a message, ostensibly from me, saying I agreed with some governmental
activity somewhere.
