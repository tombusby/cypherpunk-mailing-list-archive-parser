After all, who could *not* want to conform with crowd?  Anyone who isn't
obsessed with being thin must have something wrong with him.  There ought
to be a law against people like him!

Only a criminal would have a reason for that! After, what legitimate use
could a citizen have with one? If he wants to hunt, he should use a
rifle!

Particularly for a cop! Why would anyone in his position need *that*!

We can take prime examples of this:  The Whitehouse hiring dilemna - if

 Maybe it's the dead guy. Maybe it's those evil Internet users...

I think we could track this to the replacement of literature and culture
with TV - if everyone from T.J. Hooker to Agents Sculley and Mulder solve
a mystery in 30 minutes, surely they can do it in real life, too.

How much do you want to bet that if it is a frame and it is successful,
they'll "find" a PGP encrypted file with plans and use it to promote GAK?
