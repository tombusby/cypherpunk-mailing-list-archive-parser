I agree: this sort of ad hominem attack has no place in a civilized,
reponsible debate on an important topic.

As for Unicorn's end-runs around the govt: I support anyone who challenges
his (or any other) government in order to keep it honest, to the extent
that they do so constructively. I hope you act responsibly, Uni.

Jim, I think you owe Unicorn a public apology, and I think it ought to be
now. If I don't see one, I'm going to feel quite OK about filtering you out
of my future archives of cpunks. Let's see how civilized you're capable of
being: we know you can talk through your "other" orifices.
