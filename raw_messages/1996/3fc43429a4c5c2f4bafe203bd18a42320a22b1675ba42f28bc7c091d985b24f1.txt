This is getting out of hand.

There's a distinct difference between tolerating prostitution and 
actively supporting it.

Your example lacks facts (as usual) which I'm sure you will fill in at 
your next opportunity with a load of dung you pull out of the air.

In the event a hotel knowingly supported prostitution, charged by the 
hour only to prostitutes, paid off police to avoid their notice, was 
owned by those connected with the illegal enterprise of prostitution and 
otherwise supported an ongoing criminal enterprise actively and 
directly, of course it will be seized.  This, as far as I can tell, has 
almost nothing to do with Mr. May's example which proffered a passive 
role, a tacid understanding and looking the other way by the hotel 
management.  A judge who upheld such a seziure would be asked, probably 
less politely than my last example, to leave the bench.  That a hotel is 
being seized, absent any showing of reason or circumstance, has so little 
to do with this point as to be amusing.  I cannot say, however, that I am 
surprised.

If there is enough interest, outside of you Mr. Bell, I will post a 
summary of asset forfeiture requirements under RICO and common law to the 
list.

Mr. Bell, your chronic out of context examples, stuffing of words into 
other peoples mouths (or posts), ignorance, and flatulant expositions 
have easily qualified you, in my book, as the most annoying and useless 
poster on the list.

I have a feeling, not to speak for Mr. May, that you have a long wait.
