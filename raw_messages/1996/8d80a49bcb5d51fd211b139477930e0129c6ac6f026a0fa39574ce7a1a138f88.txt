Some algorithms have usable inverses, but good ones try not to;
one class of known plaintext attack is working your way back through
the algorithm to discover the key bits using the known parts.
Another kind of attack is just to brute-force the key, assuming the
algorithm or key length is short enough to do that quickly.

Algorithms vary widely on their susceptibility.  Consider a one-time-pad:
even if you know the first 256 bytes of the transaction, all that does
is let you recover the first 256 bytes of key, which will never be used again,
even in the second half of the message.   Pretty useless, usually.
On the other hand, consider a simple "xor with the key, repeating as often
as needed";
if the key's no longer than your known plaintext, xor again, find the key,
repeat as often as needed, and you've got the whole message.

Using the same technique with DES will be left as an exercise for the reader :-)
