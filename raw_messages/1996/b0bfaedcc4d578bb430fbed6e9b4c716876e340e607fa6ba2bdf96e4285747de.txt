It has long occurred to me, considering the size and low power of the 
typical 3.5" hard drive compared with the size of the typical house or 
apartment, that it might be an interesting project to remotely connect such 
a (hidden) drive to your computer using a reasonably surreptious link that 
is difficult to trace.  Say, an IR optical link, a single bare (unjacketed) 
optical fiber, a LAN with hidden nodes, or a similar system.  Maybe an 
inductive pickup.  In any raid, they'll have to decide what to take, and 
chances are very good that they won't find every hidden item.
