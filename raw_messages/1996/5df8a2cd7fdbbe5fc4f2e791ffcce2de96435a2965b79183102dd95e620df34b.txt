Actually, my assertion was that the basic motivation was racism and
ignorance.  My example of student loan default rates should clear that up.
College graduates generally live outside of redlines and yet are regularly
offered credit.  And yet default rates on student loans are outrageous (the
government backing of these loans is irrelevant to individual
creditworthiness).
