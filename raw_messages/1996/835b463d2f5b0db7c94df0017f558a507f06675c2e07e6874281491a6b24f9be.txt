Absolutely.  However, from a vendor's point of view, customers have a wide
range of security problems.  Some run in an open environment and have no
use for security.  They may still be using those VT100s.  These are the
customers the vendor considers when thinking of backwards compatibility.

There are several "users" at issue.  I fully agree that those
administrators responsible for upgrading the software and hardware for the
change will notice.  The people who have to pay for it all should also
notice.  But the actual end user may find the logon simplified.  If is
sufficent to mearly identify the machine and not the person, then the new
software can eliminate end user involvement in the logon.  The
administrator is responsible for installing the private key in the machine
and the end user never sees it.

On the other hand, if users still must be identified, it is possible to
give them a logon interface which is unchanged from the old,
non-one-time-password, interface, while still giving them the benefits.
