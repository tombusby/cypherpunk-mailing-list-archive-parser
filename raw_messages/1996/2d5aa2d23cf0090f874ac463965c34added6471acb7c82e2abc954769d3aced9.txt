In part because it's not well integrated with mailers.  That could 
change with a PGP3 DLL.

PGP isn't only used for email:

 o files distributed over the net that are PGP-signed
 o signed email
 o non-emailed file distributions (over BBS, or physical
    transfer of disks)
 o personal storage (though other utilities are better-suited
    for that than PGP)
 o related utilities that make use of PGP-keys (HPack
    archiver)

The reasons PGP hasn't become widely used are because of it's lack of 
user-friendliness and poor integration into other tools, irregardless 
of S/MIME.
