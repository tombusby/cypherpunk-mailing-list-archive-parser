= Could you explain your statement below:  
=   
= 	the first time you witness a small child begging for chocolate 
= exploded by a remote control pressed by her father, you understand 
= --you do not necessarily like it, it's just survival.  
=     
= Why was the child exploded? To kill the soldier it was requesting 
= chocolate from?  
=  
 
	human life is cheap in many non-Western countries, particularly 
    the orient.  Female children are considered expendable (in China 
    where parents are limited to one child; the abortion of a female 
    fetus is common). 
 
	children in war zones have always begged chocalate from 
    soldiers and even a small child can pack enough plastiques to wipe 
    out an entire patrol. 
 
	as I said, it is one or the other --the child dies either way, 
    and explosives are very messy. 
 
	no matter how war movies are glorified for joe six-pack, war is 
    still hell.
