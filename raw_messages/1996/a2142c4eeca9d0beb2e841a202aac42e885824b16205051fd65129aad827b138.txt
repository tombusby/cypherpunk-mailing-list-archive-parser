No arguments here. Check out the latest article to follow up on the
CyberWire Dispatch story in which Brock and I revealed what the
"smut-blockers" *really* block. 

It's in Internet World Online, at the URL below.

    Porno-filtering software may be blocking out more than most people 
    realize.

   Porno-filtering software or "censorware" is a big thing these days. It
   lets parents make sure their kids aren't seeing Bad Things on the Net
   -- things like pornography, violence, and information about drugs. Oh,
   and did we mention AIDS, Judaism, fascism, and some guy named Fred?
   How about any Web site in the crl.com domain? Thanks to an apparent
   philosophy of "block first, ask questions later" -- plus a combination
   of overzealousness, with a little laziness and ignorance tossed in --
   some filtering software is screening out more than most people expect.
   To top it off, often neither users of the software nor owners of the
   blocked sites know about it.
