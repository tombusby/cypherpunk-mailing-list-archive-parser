Tell this to Unicorn.  He seems to disagree, although he hasn't cited specifics yet.

Adding the conditional "for graphological purposes," I can't.  I was merely 
referring to a SC decision previously quoted here.  The writing of that

If that's really the case, and this would today be considered a clear violation of the 5th, what does that say about the claim that "current government policy" must be right?
