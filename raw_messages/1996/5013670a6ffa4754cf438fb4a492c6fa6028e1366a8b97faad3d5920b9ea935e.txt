Another flaw with schemes of this time (in terms of failing to meet their
goals) is that they cannot detect superencryption and other forms of
non-standard encryption of the message body proper.  All they can really
do is verify from the outside that the same session key is encrypted for
the two recipients (the intended recipient and the Government Access to
Keys Party - let's not abuse the term by calling him a Trusted Third
Party).  But they can't be sure that the session key is sufficient
information to decrypt the message.

The session key could itself be a PK encrypted form of the actual
message session key, so that the true recipient would have to run the PK
decryption algorithm through two iterations before he actually got the
real message session key.  Or the message could be simply superencrypted
using a non-escrowed encryption system, then encrypted using the GAK
technique so that it looks fine from the outside.

These kind of techniques could be detected by the recipient, but as
Adam Back points out there are much simpler techniques if we just want
the recipient to be able to tell whether the key has been encrypted for
the GAKP.  For that matter if *he*'s really concerned about it he can
forward the plaintext to whatever governments he likes.
