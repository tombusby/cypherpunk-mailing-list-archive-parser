Dear ALL: 
 
I apologize if I happen to send this two you more than once.  If so it was 
not intentional. 
 
I received this warning from a reliable software vendor and thought I 
would pass it on to you and wish you a Merry Christmas too. 
 
 
**********************VIRUS ALERT************************************ 
 
        VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION, PLEASE READ! 
 
There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet.  If 
you  receive an E-Mail message with the subject line "Deeyenda", DO NOT 
read the message, DELETE it immediately! 
      
Some miscreant is sending E-Mail under the title "Deeyenda" nationwide, 
if you get anything like this DON'T  DOWNLOAD THE FILE!  It has a virus 
that rewrites your hard drive, obliterates anything on it.  Please be 
careful and forward this E-Mail to anyone you care about. 
      
Please read the message below. 
      
FCC WARNING!!!!! -----DEEYENDA PLAGUES INTERNET 
      
The Internet community has again been plagued by  another computer 
virus. This message is being spread throughout the Internet, including 
USENET posting, E-MAIL, and other Internet activities. The reason for 
all the attention is because of the nature of this virus and the 
potential security risk it makes.  Instead of a destructive Trojan virus 
(like most viruses!), this virus referred to as Deeyenda Maddick, 
performs a comprehensive search on your computer, looking for valuable 
information, such as E-Mail and login passwords, credit cards, personal 
inf., etc. 
      
The Deeyenda virus also has the capability to stay memory resident while 
running a host of applications and operation systems, such as Windows 
3.11 and Windows 95.  What this means to Internet users is that when a 
login and password are send to the server, this virus can copy this 
information and SEND IT OUT TO UN UNKNOWN ADDRESS (varies). 
      
The reason for this warning is because the Deeyenda virus is virtually 
undetectable.  Once attacked your computer will be unsecured.  Although 
it can attack any O/S this virus is most likely to attack those users 
viewing Java enhanced Web Pages (Netscape 2.0+ and Microsoft Internet 
Explorer 3.0+ which are running under Windows 95).  Researchers at Princeton 
University have found this virus on a number of World Wide Web pages and 
fear its spread. 
      
Please pass this on, for we must alert the general public of the 
security risks.
