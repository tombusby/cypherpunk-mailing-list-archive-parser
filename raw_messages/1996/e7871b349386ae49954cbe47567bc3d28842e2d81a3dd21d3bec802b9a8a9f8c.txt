"As bad"?!?  Actually, it's a good deal worse.  See below.

Well good.  Better nonstandardized chaos than a single, arbitrarily
defined and applied system.  (Ref: "Parental Advisory" stickers, which
were IMHO totally useless, and a doomed concept from the start.)

I think that if there's going to be ratings, better to have lots of
different organizations reflecting different tastes and mores than
one organization reflecting political pressures and prejudices.

(No real crypto relevance in the concept per say, but perhaps in
the application (as Bill pointed out with the PICS excerpt).)
