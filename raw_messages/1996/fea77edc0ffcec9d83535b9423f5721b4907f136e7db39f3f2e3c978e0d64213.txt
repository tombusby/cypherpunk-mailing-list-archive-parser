	But do keep in mind that it's not just the US government that can
decrypt weak cryptography. So can a lot of other governments... including ones
like France and Japan that engage in a lot of commercial espionage. And ITAR
restrictions have hindered the use of cryptography in the US by limiting the
market for products.
	As has been said on here in the past, there are probably several
groups within the NSA. Some think that getting the info is more important
than protecting US citizens from having _their_ info stolen. Some think the
reverse. And the ones in the NSA (and the rest of the US government) with
darker motives (power et al) are going to be in the first group - they're not
concerned with effects on US citizens.
