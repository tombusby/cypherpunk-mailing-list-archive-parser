If you include the archives of this list, the main forign archives, and the
various sources in the US, you will EASILY exceed 100 megs.  (More like
200.)  If you seperate out all the duplications, you might squeeze under the
100 megs mark.

It would be a nice thing to have if it is reletivly complete.  Hopefully it
can be created with a minimum of government interfearence.  (But then, I
have been xpecting alt.binaries.crypto to be created as well...)

Sounds about right.  You will probibly need to run about 1000 or so.
Actually, the prices for CDs in bulk are pretty cheap.  (Just expensive up
front.)  Depends how much premastering you are able to do up front.  (If you
need information and/or contacts to get mastering done, send me private
e-mail.  I used to work for a CD-ROM company.)

Not that I know of...  I have seen a few of the "Hacker" discs with crypto
code on it, but nothing complex (other than ancient versions of PGP) and you
have to wade though alot of crap to get to it.

Archives of the PGP key database, the archive at hacktic.nl,
ftp.dsi.unimi.it, ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de, and probibly a few other
archives would be useful.  An index/search engine would also be helpful.
