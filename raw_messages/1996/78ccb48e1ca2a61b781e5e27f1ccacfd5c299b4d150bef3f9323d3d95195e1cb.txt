Mark,
        The protocol works well as long as you trust the ability of
clients to generate random numbers and you are not too worried about 
replay or message modification attacks.  If you are, then the session 
key should be a function of random values chosen by both the client 
and the server.  That way, a replay of the initial connection message 
will not cause the server to use the same key.  
        You may also want to add key verification in case the application
does not already provide a simple way to tell if both parties are using 
the same key.  For example, the client and server could exchange known 
values encrypted under the session key before continuing.
        Here's a protocol based on the ISO standards that has both
dual key determination (both parties influence the key value and neither 
can control the range of possible keys in any useful way), and dual
key validation (both parties end up knowing they are talking to someone 
who can compute the common key).

Client computes:
  Mc = unpredictable 128 bit value.  Serves as authenticator and
       as a value that is unknown to the attacker.
  Nc = H(Mc)  // Hash of Mc like MD5(Mc)

C->S: C, S, Nc
    The names or IP addresses of C & S are included to avoid various
replay and reflection attacks.  Message integrity is done later.

Server computes:
  Ms = unpredictable 128 bit value.
  Ns = H(Ms)
  P = shared passphrase padded with zeros to multiple of 64 bytes
      which is the block size of the hash function's compress operation.
  K = H(P || H(P || C || Nc || S || Ns)) 
  Vs = Enc(K, Ms)
       The value Ms is unknown to the attacker, so this value does not
       help with mounting a brute force key search.

S->C: S, C, Ns, Vs

Client computes:
  P = shared passphrase padded with zeros to multiple of 64 bytes
      which is the block size of the hash function's compress operation.
  K = H(P || H(P || C || Nc || S || Ns)) 
  X = Dec(K, Vs)
  Test that H(X) = Ns, if not return error and close connection. 
  Vc = Enc(K, Mc)

C->S: C, S, Vc

Server computes:
  X = Dec(K, Vs)
  Test that H(X) = Ns, if not return error and close connection.
  
All subsequent communication should be encrypted with K.

I'm trying to put together a simple protocol for encrypting confidential 
but typically low-value data (i.e. I don't want people to be able to read 
it, but in most cases it wouldn't be catastrophic if they could). I want 
it to be completely license-free, so I can't use RSA or other patented 
algorithms. It also would only be used inside one organisation, so key 
management isn't so much of a problem, and the main attack it has to 
defend against is packet-sniffing on the Net. It also has to support 
variable-length keys for ITAR.. 

The idea is as follows..


Client and server both have copies of a passphrase, of any length.

When starting the connection, client sends 128 random bits to the server.

Both ends take this data, append the passphrase, and use MD5 to generate 
a session key. If a key of less than 128 bits is required for legal 
reasons, then the appropriate number of bits are retained, and the rest 
replaced with bits from the random data that was sent in the clear.

That is, if you're only allowed 40 bit security, you take the first 88 
bits that you were sent, and append the last 40 bits of the generated key 
to give you the session key to use.

You then go off and encrypt the session (probably using 3DES or Blowfish). 


Can anyone spot any flaws in this system ? The only potential problem I 
can see would be that by cracking a number of sessions you could work out 
the passphrase. However, I think the number required would still be 
infeasible. 

Also, are there any known problems with using Blowfish for encrypting a 
data stream ? I'm assuming it's OK as it's used in PGPfone.
