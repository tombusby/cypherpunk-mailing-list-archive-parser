# It may be unpleasant, but it's a fact that there was a real security

Let's look at this from the perspective of a company with a firewall:
    Q: Do I want my users dictating what's allowed?
    A: Probably not.

    Q: Do I want my software vendors dictating what's allowed?
    A: Maybe not.

    Real Q1: When are sun/netscape/browser-vendor-x going to provide
    standardized, secure, multi-teired configuration options?

    Real Q2: It seams to me that most of the standard TCP protocols that a
    gopher client can talk to should have similarly standard protocol-specifiers
    for the URL.  Browser vendors are in a perfect position to say "this lack
    of synchronization is a real problem" and "It's bitten us already" and to 
    take care of the problem by proposing RFCs.  

    Real Q3: (Somewhat off-topic) when are signed applets going to appear?

    comprehensive standards coupled with multi-teired configuration options 
    would allow real-world customers and their net-neighbors to sleep a little 
    better at night.
