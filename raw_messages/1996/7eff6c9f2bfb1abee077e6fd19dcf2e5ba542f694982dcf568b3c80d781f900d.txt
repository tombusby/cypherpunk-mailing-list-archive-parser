This actually makes a lot of sense; if you've decided on an all-out war on
drugs, doing it right is *much* better than some sort of weenie effort like
we've got.  I liked Robert Heinlein on immigration "If we're going to stop
immigration build a Berlin style wall complete with alligators in the moat. 
Otherwise give up the pretense; nothing is more expensive or less useful than a
wall that isn't."  (very loosely paraphrased)
