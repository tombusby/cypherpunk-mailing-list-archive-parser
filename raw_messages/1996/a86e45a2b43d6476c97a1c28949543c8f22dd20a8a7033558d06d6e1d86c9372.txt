Add me to the list as well.

As someone put it, you do not abandon those you admire just
becuase you do not agree with them.  (Or something like
that...)

The people who anon are ranting about have done real work for
the cause of free crypto.  I have not seen any such "good
works" from Mr. Anon.

I think that the Leahy bill is very flawed.  It has some strong
room for abuse by the government.  it will also bring the
issues into the public eye and maybe even get them to think
about some of the issues revolving around the sillyness of
ITAR. (Or at least one can hope.)  But then, I think we are
about to move into a new dark ages of the net anyways...  The
net has become an officially government recognised buzzword,
thus ensuring its doom.  (But I am a pessimist... So there!)
