I was trying to explain how incomes and prices happened to be
lower in India, which is the reason why companies like Informix
like to hire Indian engineers.

I imagine (not knowing why Informix does what it does) that the
reason might have something to do with:

1) Bringing the programmer closer to the customer, to understand
the problem better, or to commission the software, debug it under
working conditions, whatever
2) If a team in the US is working on the project as well,
sometimes it helps to have the entire team physically proximate.
3) With team members far away, you may have concerns about
security of confidential information.

I could think of another reason or two.

Could you please be more precise? In what way does the "power of
the Indian government" intrude? You use the term "proven" rather
loosely... there could be other explanations for the company
wanting to move its employees around.

Huh? Yes, we do have a bureaucratic state, which is infuriating,
and not just to the companies, but we've always had lots of
companies happy to be here. This is a big market, and a nice
place to live (and not just the natives say so).

True -- democracy is a learning process, and the lessons
sometimes come hard. I don't know of any other way to learn.
