In response to my point that refusing to release the source code of his
software will have the effect of discouraging its use by anyone with a
clue,

This goes without saying.

Incorrect.  You have incorporated PGP in a new piece of software.  How are
we to know you took the code line for line unless we are able to verify
this claim?  Obviously, we cannot.

Your software is, therefore, untrustworthy.  This is not a matter simply
of my opinion.  This is basic doctrine in the development of crypto
software.  Ask anyone who knows what they are talking about.

Joe Average may be interested in your product, but no expert, or even
fairly knowledgeable individual, will ever take it seriously while the
source code remains private.

Your attitude distresses me and your ignorance of the importance of peer
review gives me pause when considering your potential skill as a crypto
programmer.

Many of us would appreciate it if your, seemingly very useful software,
was also trustworthy enough to be used.
