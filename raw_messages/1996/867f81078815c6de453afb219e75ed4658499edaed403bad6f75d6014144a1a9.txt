: Church of Scientology. Someone posted too many Secret Scriptures, it
: seems. The details, nobody has shared. Conspiracy theories, galore, but I
: have faith in their judgement and commitment to free speech and anonymity.
: I'm sure it was a tough decision.

: Btw, I don't believe it has shut down yet. Rather, the operators announced
: that due to "recent events," there would be a planned shutdown on May
: 20th. 

: I *would* like to know if the mail2news gateway is going down in addition
: to the remailer. I'm assuming that it is. 

utopia.hacktic.nl is currently MX'ed to basement.replay.com, and the
mail2news gateway has been installed there to. mail2news@utopia.hacktic.nl
will work as long as utopia is MX'ed so one better use the one installed 
directly by mailing your posts to mail2news@basement.replay.com.
