	The below (from your essay) is a reasonable way to look at it. I
would tend to compare a system to obviously possible systems as well as to
simply what else is out there, however.

	In this regard, I would call the system in question about midway
between a truly descriptive system and such obviously judgemental systems
as SafeSurf. This partially judgemental nature is probably unavoidable in
systems in which one uses a non-binary rating scheme; if the presence of
something inevietably means that the system gives a "high" rating, then
the system is judging that the something is more important than other
factors. In this case, the judgement is pretty obviously that they deem the
something in question (such as "hate speech" that calls for "harm" to some
class - although I doubt they'd include pro-Affirmative-Action speech in
that...) to be worse than the "lower" rated actions.

	I would agree that RSAC's system is pretty deterministic; the
choices of what is labelled are rather arbitrary, but that falls under
the description vs judgement category above.

	As currently set up, RSAC is either voluntary or mandatory - a
government could require that it be used as a mandatory system, directly
or indirectly (e.g., under threat of lawsuits for "corrupting minors").

	Agreed.
