Technology, will debate Cathleen Cleaver of the Family Research Council
TONIGHT (Thurs 2/15) on PBS's 'News Hour with Jim Lerher'. (Formerly the

challenges, the recent announcement by Compuserve to un-block Usenet access
and provide parental control technologies to CIS subscribers, and other
issues relating to Internet Censorship.
