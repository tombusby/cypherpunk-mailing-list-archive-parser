   February Byte reviews nine non-US (non-NSA, wah?)
   crypto programs, ranging from uses for a single laptop to
   company networks to transmissions on the Internet, by
   Martin Banks, a UK writer. Admire these deadpan marketing
   names:

      Deadlock (uk)
      EasySafe and MasterSafe (il)
      Latches for Windows (uk)
      Safeguard Easy (de)
      SecureData (uk)
      SmartLock (it)
      StopLock (uk)
      TeamWare Crypto (uk)

      and, more Jim Carey-ly:

      Visage (uk) -- which uses faces as passphrase!


   NON_nsa  (For those with non-key-access to Byte)
