There's also at least one hate-crazed Armenian who wants to suppress all
discussions of the genocide of 2,500,000 Turks, Kurds, and Sephardic Jews
by his bloodthirsty compatriots.

As for the hoodlums like Paul Bradley, who attack the crypto discussions
on this list, I'm sure he's too stupid to work for the NSA. He's just an idiot.

I used to work with one Armenian guy who used to work for the NSA and couldn't
get crypto clearance because he was Armenian - that's right, because he had
relatives back there. So he quit and went into business for himself. His wife
was also Armenian, but she was able to work for the NSA for many years.
