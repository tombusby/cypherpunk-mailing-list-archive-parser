In response to my questioning why one would want to run
an ActiveX control in a sandbox Ray writes:

I would be happier running an ActiveX control with Peter Trei's signature on it
than I would an unsigned control in a sandbox.  (This kind of a trust decision
is probably the normal case in the intranet world.  ActiveX as it sits is quite
sufficient for rolling out internal intranet applications.)

On the second point, I never suggested that a sandbox would require virtual CPU
emulation.  What I do find likely is that the overhead from the extended types
of checking the kernel would need to do would probably outweight the performance
advantage of native code over a JIT compiler.  The DES cracker is probably not
a good example of the problem because it would make virtually no API calls.

This is scaremongering.  No, I don't virus scan every new CD I get from
Microsoft/Netscape/etc, do you?  More importantly to the discussion at
hand, what is to prevent said virus from infecting the compiler used to
build the sandbox?  Part of the decision to trust a software vendor must
include trusting that they use appropriate clean build procedures.

If you choose to run an unsigned control all bets are off.  On a related note,
I recently saw a Java implementation of a board game that recommended
the user download the zipped up .classes and run it locally.  How many
average users realize this would disable the Java sandbox entirely?

You mis-read the paragraph above.  Trying to build the sandbox for native
code as you've described is akin to the problem above.  Is it not?
