Exactly.

As I described in another post last night, this is the point.

I've mostly given up on trying to change the existing laws and political
system...it is too far down the path de Tocqueville described a century and
a half ago (roughly, "America's great experiment with democracy will last
only until the populace discovers it can pick the pockets of others at the
ballot box.").

Strong cryptography at least returns "freedom of association" to us, albeit
not with True Names, and may return other freedoms to us as well.

By bypassing democracy, the true enemy of liberty.
