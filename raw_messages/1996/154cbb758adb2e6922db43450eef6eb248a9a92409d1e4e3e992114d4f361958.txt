I'm no etymologist, nor do I play one on TV, but...

A few words of note about the "four letter words":
a) at one time they were quite acceptable, even after the Norman invasion 
of England; read Chaucer's Canterbury Tales... meant to be read in polite 
company, mind you.  A few Old English texts are also peppered with them, 
which at the time was also quite acceptable...
b) ...while words for bodily functions like shit, pis, fuck, etc. were 
acceptable, blasphemes were not... "god dammit" and "ods-bodkin" and 
"bloody" ("odsblood") were really naughty, even legally punishable(?). 
Note that the latter are quite usable on TV and have been used in 
congress on C-SPAN quite often while the former are illegal... you can 
make a very good religious argument for banning blasphemes and allowing 
words for bodily functions...
c) for a Latin-speaker in Ancient Rome, "feces" = "shit", etc. etc. Some 
languages do not distinguish a polite word vs. a naughty word for these 
things (a very important point)
d) they're just words... superstitious beliefs that a word is harmful...

ObCrypto: I wish I knew.... back to your regularly scheduled programme.
