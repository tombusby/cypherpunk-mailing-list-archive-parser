This is, of course, an opportunity for agents (programmed, or two legged)
to use their superior knowledge of the service/technology/business to
optimize service for ordinary people.

I think that agent providers would gain reputations.  Many consumers might
trust an agent from Consumer's Union for example.  If there end up being
only a few types of agent, then I would expect to see an "arms race"
between charging systems and agents.  The providers would try to devise
charges which maximize their profit, while the agents would try to get the
best combination of service and cost for their users.  This race would be
similar to the situation we see in the telephone industry, with its
continuously changing "special long distance deals".

I assume any user interface will be in terms of the user's interests. 
Since these interests will change over time as the environment and user's
knowledge change, the UI will be a hard problem.  However, the UI will be
another factor in the user's agent selection process.

With the current low speed dialup connections, the savings on billing costs
are probably greater than the costs of bandwidth "over use".

Even a cash based payment system will have costs.  The lowest cost IP
payment system I know of, Norm Hardy's Digital Silk Road, has the cost of
increasing the complexity of the IP routers.  There is no free lunch here. 
Whether you call it accounting, billing, or micropayment; it is an
additional function which must be performed by a piece of code with
stringent performance requirements.
