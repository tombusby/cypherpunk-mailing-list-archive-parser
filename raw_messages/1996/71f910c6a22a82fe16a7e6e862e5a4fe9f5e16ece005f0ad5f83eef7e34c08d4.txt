It seems to me that very little communication over the ISA/PCI bus should be 
necessary.  If the Custom/FPGA/Whatever chips are reasonably self-managing, 
you'd just need to query them every second or so to see if they've found a 
solution yet.  (My WAG is that the chips would be initially set up to start 
checking at a particular key, with the decrypt done and the checking for 
equality with the target data done automatically.  If the data is the same 
as the target data, the processor would halt  (possibly setting some sort of 
daisy-chained interrupt?) and wait to be queried by the host processor.  
Otherwise it would increment the key, and try again at 10 million checks per 
second. The whole thing would probably be fully pipelined, for obvious 
reasons.)  

 Putting "N" such chips on a board should be quite doable, with an 
essentially unlimited expandability, possibly in large (10 by 10?  20 by 
20?) arrays, but then you couldn't install it directly as an ISA card.  
Admittedly this is all just trivial layout work, but as you pointed out it 
would be nice if the package was reasonably slick-looking.  Making a 
10-by-10-by-10(card) cube would be theatrical, if nothing else.  (as I 
understand it, immersing the whole thing in a vat of Freon to keep the chips 
cool and watching the thing bubble merrily away is great fun.)

Remember that part of this project may be to bring such a device to a 
Congressional hearing as a prop, and say that "this box can crack a DES 
encrypt in an average of 1.5 months" or something like that.

I wouldn't imagine the power of the host computer would be at all relevant, 
however.  Right?  And DRAM requirements should be, well, fairly small.

This confuses me.  Are you anticipating that the host processor would be 
doing a substantial amount of the work?

_IF_ the amount of handshaking needed from the host processor is extremely 
low, there is essentially no limit to how many such processors could be 
attached to even a low-power '386 or so.

Well, I can't say I have any experience in the area of trying to stir up 
support for a project in this area, but I think it would at least be nice to 
know that there is a willing fab BEFORE the design is completed.  For one 
thing, fabs have small but significant differences in their capabilities.   
Two layers of poly and two of metal are probably more than enough to 
accomplish this, but taking advantage of greater capabilities wouldnt' be 
possible if the design had already been completed.  I'd sure hate to hear, 
"yeah, we can give you a two-layer-metal process, but your 3-layer metal 
design won't fit!"

BTW, I'm not rejecting the idea of using an FPGA.  Other people know a lot 
more about their current capabilities than I do, and if they know a modern 
FPGA will implement a DES crack, great.  The big advantage of an FPGA is 
that it is a relatively high-volume product and it shouldn't be hard to 
either get a donation of them or buy them for a reasonable price.  On the 
other hand, can they really implement all the internal logic required to 
crack DES?  A custom chip would make this trivial, I'd think.

This may be another reason to shop around for the fab early.  Some people 
may be hard to convince, or perhaps they would be willing to help if they 
were given a certain number of months to plan.

I can see that figuring out the approximate size of the chip, as well as 
power consumption (defines the package, pin count, etc) is important.

Maybe they're all busy building DRAMs!  Associated with that  80% drop in 
DRAM prices between January of this year and today, is what I've vaguely 
heard is an approximate doubling in part volume.

Well, let's see.  Assume we're talking 150 watts of power per computer, at a 
price of about 10 cents per kwh.  That's 3.6 kwh per day, or 36 cents per 
day.  This works out to about $131 per computer-year, or $591,000 of 
electricity for 4500 machines.  Okay, I was a little off, but you get the 
point.

Obviously, things would help out a bit if the monitor were turned off, or 
the hard drives were shut down, etc,  or you were in an area with cheaper 
electricity.

Well, okay, but let's not burn our bridges too quick.

I suppose one possible problem with Intel is that most of their fabs are 
likely to be dedicated to extremely high-value parts, as opposed to 
garden-variety MOS.
