Snake-Oil Warning Signs

     Technobabble 

     If the vendor's description appears to be confusing nonsense, it may 
very well be so, even to an expert in the field. One sign of technobabble is 
a description which uses newly invented terms or trademarked terms without 
actually explaining how the system works. Technobabble is a good way to 
confuse a potential user and to mask the vendor's own lack of expertise. 

     And consider this: if the marketing material isn't clear, why expect 
the instruction manual to be any better? Even the best product can be 
useless if it isn't applied properly. If you can't understand what a vendor 
is saying, you're probably better off finding something that makes more 
sense.

Dear Matt,

Maybe something about needing a thesaurus to translate their marketing stuff 
needs to be added to this. ;)
