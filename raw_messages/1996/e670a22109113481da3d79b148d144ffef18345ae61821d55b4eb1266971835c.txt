This is yet another one of the many reasons I advocate a system, AP,  that 
some people around here call "extremely radical."  (By today's standards it 
_is_ "extremely radical," but only in the sense that many sheeple seem ready 
to continue to tolerate the status quo.)

I assert that if there is a mechanism in existence over the medium to long 
term to allow officialdom to punish people without conviction for things 
that are not even crimes, then I see nothing wrong with setting up a 
different system to punish these _officials_, without conviction, for things 
that THEY would claim are not crimes.  If those officials wish to avoid this 
punishment, they should resign or even better, use their powers to 
immediately eliminate that unfair and unjustified punishment for ordinary 
citizens.

But I guess this solution is a bit too obvious for some, huh?  B^)

Maybe we should call it "Contempt of Citizenry."
