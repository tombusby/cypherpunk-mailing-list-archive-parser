Sure, I agree that _contracts_ can make a difference. But note that
contracts are not a requirement of employment: I can, for example, hire
someone to rake my leaves. If he decides that manual labor violates his
"civil rights," I can give him the boot. No muss, no fuss, no contracts.

(But contracts are of course possible. Enforcement of the terms is another
matter. By the way, I think enforcement of such contracts should be handled
outside the normal legal system, and paid for by the parties using the
system.)
