I raised this type of idea on CP, twice, and didn't hear a peep about it!  
(As recently as a couple of days ago.)  It doesn't entirely eliminate the 
illegality; it merely transfers that illegality to an unknown and thus 
unprosecutable person.  But yes, it appears that nothing would prevent this 
technique from working very well.

Any attempted prosecution would fare even less well than the example of 
Zimmermann and PGP 1.0:  There would be no illusion that an encryption 
product sold in hundreds of stores nationwide could be kept within the 
borders of the US, so the domestic manufacturer is safe.  The foreign 
distributor isn't violating any of his own country's laws, and probably not 
arguably any of the US.  Both companies could enthusiastically invite the 
USG to prosecute whoever actually exported the software, laughing all the 
way to the bank.
