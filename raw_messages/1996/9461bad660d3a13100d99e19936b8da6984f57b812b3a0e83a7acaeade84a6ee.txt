Keep in mind the BCFE comes from a traditional liberal bent. However, 
even though Schlafly is no friend of free speech as it relates to 
sexually explicit material, I welcome her participation in the wiretap 
debate. Privacy cuts across partisan lines.

I would love to have her column in the hands of some of the Republican
senators who will vote on the House wiretap bill or craft their own next
month.
