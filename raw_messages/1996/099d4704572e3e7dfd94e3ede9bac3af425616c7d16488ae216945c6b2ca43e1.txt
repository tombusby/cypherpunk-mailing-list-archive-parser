PARIS, September 16 ‹ The international developement of the Internet leads
governments, users organisations and corporations to find a compromise for
the use and disposal of encryption, which allows to keep the secrecy of
digital communications.
Governments want to keep the possibility to intervene on communications in
order to fight computer crime. The industry (private companies) search a
way to keep an eye on their communications' integrity not to erode their
competitivity. And privacy organisations want to preserve citizens' privacy
and freedom of speech in expression networks such as the Internet.

Before a meeting of governmental experts (under the auspices of the OECD
Sept 26, 27 in Paris), the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a
Washington, DC-based organisation, asked scientists, international right
jurists and associations to meet on September 25 for a conference.

The conference will stresses on legal aspects of computer-based secrecy,
based on propositions made by some countris to create a regime of
"encryption under conditions" (encryption under control), on the Trusted
Third Party Services (TTP) scheme. Companies that will keep encryption keys
of corporations and individuals would have to keep them at disposition of
law enforcement authorities. Who will play this TTP role? Which garanty for
end users? EPIC asked the world's most valuable experts to answer these
questions.
