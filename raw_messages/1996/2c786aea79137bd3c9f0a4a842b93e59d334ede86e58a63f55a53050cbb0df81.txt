Jim Bell is confused.  He was assuming that you were refering to the Feb
Cypherpunks meeting held in Portland.  The meeting was held in a private
residence and Jim was asked not to attend because the owner of the apartment
did not want to deal with Mr. Bell's poor behaviour.  It had nothing to do
with his political beliefs.  It had everything to do with how he handles
himself when his views are challenged.

But then, everything that happens in Portland that is not to Jim's
satisfaction is somehow my fault...
