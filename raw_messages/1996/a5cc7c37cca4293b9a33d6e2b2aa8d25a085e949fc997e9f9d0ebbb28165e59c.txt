So how do you get a fair trial on a controversial issue?  I'm asking this seriously.

In the O.J. case, if the "evidence" followed standards and weren't tainted, and they
didn't have a racist psycho like Fuhrman all over the case, and neo-Nazis over at
Cedars-Sinai collecting O.J.'s blood, then we wouldn't have so much controversy.

But the "mass majority" decided he was guilty anyway, damn the evidence or how it was
collected, or what that could mean if you or I were framed, so, take a look around at
cypherpunks, and how they disagree widely on issues, and ask yourself how you could
get a fair trial from a cypherpunks jury.

But the jury system is still *much* better than judges only, as long as the jury isn't
stacked.  For example, the new O.J. jury is nearly all white, and since that particular
venue requires only a majority (not unanimous) decision, the jury is defacto all white,
which is tantamount to a lynching.

So how do you prescribe fair jury selection?
