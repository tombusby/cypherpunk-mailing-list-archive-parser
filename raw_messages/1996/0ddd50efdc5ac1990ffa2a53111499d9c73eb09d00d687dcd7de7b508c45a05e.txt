That depends highly on the cypher.  Also depends on if your "initialization
vector" is truly random.  (Or even close, as some other companies have found
in the past...)

It is resistant to all attacks that you know of.  Depending on the nature of
the algorythm, this could be true in some sense, false in some sense and
meaningless in some sense.  Without published code, it is meaningless in all
senses.

As someone who has spent time reverse engeneering code, I find this one
pretty funny.  The only thing I have found that will obscure code in any
real fashion is writing it badly.  "Roadblocks" to reverse engeneering also
tend to be a speed hit.  Either way, it will not stop someone with the
proper skills and tools.

Do we have to read them in reverse order or is that part of the roadblock
you are using to make things more difficult...?

I will be interested to see just what kind of liability problems you run
into when this thing gets compromised.  Of course, with a name like "The
Pouch", you will probibly just claim it was a "kangaroo court".
