Dear Sir,
We are producing the national television series .com hosted by Star Wars 
 celebrity Mark Hamill.  The series airs nationally on CNBC and the Bravo 
 Network and is all about the Internet and how it is changing the way we do 
 business.  We are reviewing storylines and Web Sites to be featured in our fall 
 programming.
 
 We have featured stories on digital Imaging including Kodak, on-line banking 
 with Digital Insight, and Healthful On Line Web Sites such The American Heart 
 Association as well as many others. 
 
 Please take this time to complete this brief questionnaire and we will consider 
 your story and Web Site as a feature on the show.  If the story or Web Site fits 
 our programming requirements, one of our producers will contact you.       
 
 There is a pre-production fee to participate on the show which offsets some of 
 the pre-production costs, however we pay for all of the production and post 
 production costs.
 
 Please allow us at least one week to review your response and your web site, 
 Thank-you.
 
 
 
 Patty Elliot
