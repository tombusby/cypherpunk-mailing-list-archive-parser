Even if they want to be spoon fed, they'll get a fair bit of tolerance
here, though they'll get pointed at the FAQs and books.  sci.crypt is
another good place.  Everybody's a newbie once; lack of knowledge
is just an opportunity.

It's folks who show up saying "I've got an unbreakable cryptosystem,
nyahh, nyahh, and it doesn't even use any algorithms, and it's so proprietary
you can't see it" that get flamed, and who try to sell snake oil while
claiming it's the hottest thing since pseudo-random number generators.

Meanwhile, I've got the franchise for Dogbert's Value-Priced One Time Pads,
and if you're Success-Oriented enough to understand Network Marketing, 
I can help you build your downline and Make E-Money Fast.  Just send
three KB of random bits to every email address on the list,
add your own name and the name of your co-conspirator to the bottom,
and send copies to all your security-conscious friends.  Within a few weeks,
you'll have a lifetime supply of one-time pads for all your paranoia needs!
