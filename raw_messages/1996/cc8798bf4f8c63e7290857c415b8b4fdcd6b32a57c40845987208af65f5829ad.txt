Yeah, the main point re. anonymity, IMO, is that you can't pretend that it's
all pro, no con. You have to acknowledge and think through the
negatives...and, as Tim May pointed out, that's already been done.

I don't think you oughtta ream somebody for pointing to the down side. That
you raise an issue should never be taken to imply that you've taken a
position, and it's vital to remain open to discussion and entertain
sentiments that oppose your own thinking.
