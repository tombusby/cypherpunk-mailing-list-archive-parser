     I agree with that.  Principles are important.  I agree that Sarin reciepes might
be dangerous.  I also agree that such information should not be broadcasted.  
But I think that this control should be effected by the individual poster, out of 
benevolence for Man, not enforced at the point of a gun by a govt that pretends 
that we are to dumb to act by ourselves.  The nature of the Internet is 
unique in the history of mankind.  We must adapt, *as individuals* not as "a society".

The collectivity is a statistical concept that have no existence, apart in the 
pretensions of the collectivists do-gooders.

I think it is safe to say, especially regarding coverage of the Internet by
popular medias, that even if there are some journalists that still have integrity,
most of their bosses don't.

Well,  here I don't completely agree.  *you* can determine what is worth and 
what is not.
But again, I suppose that if you have rationnal arguments, you will be able
to convince other rationnal individuals.  I am not in favor of broadcasting 
neo-nazi scum all over because I think that their essence is the same as the one
underlying the censorship movement.  They share the same vision of man, only the
flavor change slightly.  OTOH, somebody presenting facts pertaining to nazism and
what happened to the jews (confirming or infirming) are acceptable, as long as 
they are *facts*.  But there are plenty of causes that seems worthwhile
to defends, so why pick up the mosts dubious?
