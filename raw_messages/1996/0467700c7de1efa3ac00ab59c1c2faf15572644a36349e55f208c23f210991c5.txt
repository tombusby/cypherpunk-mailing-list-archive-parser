I expect this problem can usually be handled without formal CAs.  If you
publish your PGP key fingerprint in your advertising and make the key
available on your web page, then your users have a way of independently
verifying your key.  As the finger print appears in more and more places
(letterhead, product packaging, etc.), it is less and less likely that your
attacker can reach them all to modify them.

The important thing is diverse paths.  If you include your key in the
package with the product and print the fingerprint on the outside, it
becomes relatively easier for your attacker to replace the whole thing as
part of an attack.
