Dear 'Sunshine', or 'Yvonne', or whatever your name is,
  I really don't think this is the kind of thing that belongs on
the InterNet.
  I have now seen this posting of yours in three different
conferences, and it is causing quite an uproar.  I think you may
need some kind of professional help.  Please stop posting these
sick messages in the conferences.
  Don't bother replying to this email, because my service provider
has blocked any further postings from you, and has contacted 'your'
service provider and the authorities about your postings.

Please, Get Help,
BRD
