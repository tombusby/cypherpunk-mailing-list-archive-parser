I'm looking for volunteers interested in testing the latest beta
version of Puffer 2.0.  Puffer is my shareware data file & e-mail 
encryption utility for Windows and has been significantly improved 
since version 1.0.  It is now a full-fledged public key encryption 
program utilizing Diffie-Hellman technology.  The exportable 
shareware version will support 512-bit public keys and 40-bit PC1 
(RC4 clone) encryption.  The U.S./Canada registered version will 
also support 1024-bit public keys and 160-bit Blowfish encryption.  
All versions support digital signatures, multi-pass data wiping 
(files, slack, & unused space), LZ77 compression, a built-in editor, 
and Windows clipboard encryption.

I am currently negotiating a patent license for the D-H algorithm 
with Cylink and an export license with the State Dept.  Testers must 
be residents of the U.S. or Canada.  I am looking for cryptography 
novices through experts using a wide range of PC hardware running 
Win 3.1, Win 95, or OS/2.  

I also have detailed text files describing the security protocols 
and file formats used.  I would like experts to take a look at these 
to make sure I didn't do something stupid.  Those that can help will 
get a free copy of the final registered version.

The software will be a 417 K zip file available via http.  I will 
e-mail the protocol and file format specifications to anyone 
interested.

Please respond by private e-mail.  Thanks.
