And so you thought you would engage in legal commentary, of course. :)

Statistical evidence is fairly strictly regulated actually in a judicial 
context.

e.g., People v. Collins, 438 P.2d 33 (1968) (prohibiting mathamatical odds and 
statistical evidence from use in identification and requireing strict 
foundation to be laid before any probability evidence will be admitted); 
Cole v. Cole, 328 S.E.2.d 446 (1985) (discussing the nature of 
probability in relation to the scope of the evidence presented); Frye v. 
U.S., 293 F. 1013 (D.C.Cir 1923) (estlablishing the rule that scientific 
evidence must be treated with a different standard even when presented 
by certified experts.  specifically that it must be 'generally accepted in 
the scientific community);  See Generally, L.J. Cohen, The Probably and 
the Provable (1977).
