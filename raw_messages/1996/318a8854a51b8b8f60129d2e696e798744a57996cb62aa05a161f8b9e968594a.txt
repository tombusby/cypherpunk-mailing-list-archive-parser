As usual, I have a solution to this problem!   (AP, for the relatively 
unitiated out there.)

If people really believe OJ is guilty, just pool your shekels and see him 
dead.   Or, if you believe the cops planted evidence, buy THEIR deaths via 
donation. (No cop would have dared risk AP to jump the wall...particularly 
if by doing so he risked having the evidence thrown out due to illegality.  
Nor would they have risked trying to frame an innocent person, or at least 
one believed innocent by a few million citizens.)  Or do both.  And so on...

Notice, however, that if AP were operational, a lot might have turned out 
differently.  First, if you assume that OJ is guilty, he would have KNOWN 
that he would be the first person suspected if Nicole were murdered.  This 
would have been an enormous deterrent, because he would have known that he'd 
be a potential target even if he managed to commit the "perfect crime" and 
leave no evidence.

However, it's even a bit more complicated that this.  Anyone considering an 
AP donation against OJ would have to realize that he KNEW all this, and 
might have been appropriately deterred, and if Nicole was killed anyway it's 
quite possible it WASN'T OJ.

Sure, thinking about this can give anyone a headache.  That's because AP 
can't answer the question, "Is OJ guilty," but it could dramatically change 
the circumstances in which such questions are answered.
