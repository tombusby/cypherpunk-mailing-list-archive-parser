For anyone who was interested in Dave's and my hardware project
(Architectural considerations for cryptanalytic hardware), it's done
(thank goodness).  You're free to check it out at

http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~iang/isaac/hardware/

in either HTML or PostScript.  Thanks to cypherpunks Eric Hughes and
Bruce Koball, and to Altera people Clive McCarthy and Stephen Smith.
