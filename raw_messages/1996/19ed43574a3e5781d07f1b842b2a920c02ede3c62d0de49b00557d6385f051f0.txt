Minor correction, it was a private e-mail that I had sent to Marianne 
over a year ago that showed up in an AltaVista search.  (It was a 
completely inadvertant mistake on her part that this happened.)

Funny to me, embarrassing to her, and a perfect (though trivial) example of 
how the evolution of "spiderspace" will, until people become more 
familiar with it, reveal all sorts of unexpected surprises.
