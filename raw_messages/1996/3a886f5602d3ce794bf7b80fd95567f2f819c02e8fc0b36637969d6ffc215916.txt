Yes, and that is why some companies (e.g., Private Lines) offer anonymous
out-bound calling services.

I find most unwanted communications objectionable, anonymous or not. How
about billboards.  Should the fact that I choose to be outside or on a
roadway make my eye a target for ads? (If so, then why not consider having
an e-mail account in a similar vein?)  The fact that I can immediately, or
later, identify the responsible party doesn't keep me from initially seeing
the ad and taking my time.  If I object, what are my alternatives?  The
last thing I want is monetary compensation.  I want my time back.  Failing
this, I want the abusers time (sorta' like in Zardoz).
