   A new book, "Digital Soldiers," by James F. Dunnigan, 
   emphasizes that information warfare -- deceiving the 
   enemy -- is as old as war, and that the PR-driven media 
   today work closely with the warfighting industry to 
   protect their mutually lucrative markets. 
 
   The latest GAK PR campaign fits this. 
 
   Dunnigan also makes hash of the recent opportunistic 
   "infowar" PR, along with adept grinding of the vast, 
   corrupt high-tech defense industry worldwide, led by the 
   US war-prognosticating PR-media-policy lizards. As he 
   says, bad news is always good news for the Hearsts and 
   Rasputins (Responsible Personages), for the liars of 
   brimstone religion, for all the terrifying doomsayers  
   peddling trust-my-god: me, now tithe or be taxed. 
 
   Dunnigan's sermon: stop the pork, then there will be  
   plenty of resources to deal with the rest of society's 
   ills. Otherwise, peace, real or vitural, is war, 
   sustained barbarity camouflaged by self-interested 
   civility -- the peacefighting, ticket-punching officer,  
   er, journalist, class.
