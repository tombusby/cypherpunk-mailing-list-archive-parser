Damn, we've been found out.

I don't suppose anyone will notice the fact that although I've
helped with the preparation for the SAFE day, I won't actually be
attending the event.

Clearly, I don't want to get caught.

PS On a more serious note, I can't get testimony into the record for this
hearing if you don't send it to me.  Sooo...please either fill out the
form at http://www.crypto.com/submit/ or if you find that format too
constraining, just send it to me in email.  I'll see what I can do to
make sure PGP signatures are reproduced intact in the Congressional Record.

Most everyone I know cannot simply jaunt off to D.C. for a day.  Why not
at least make your voice heard?
