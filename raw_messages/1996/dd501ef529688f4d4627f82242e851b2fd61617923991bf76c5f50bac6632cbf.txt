Gunlaws and druglaws have deep roots in racism, but it is politically
incorrect to say, even if I can find it in the congressional record.
[and I can.]

But then it was certainly Jim Bell who wrote:

If someone tried a scheme involving violence such as A. P. through
a remailer I was involved in, the feds would not have to threaten me
with prosecution to get me to cooperate with them. I may not keep any
logs right now, Jim, but if your little scheme gets underway I will
cooperate willingly as long as I don't compromise the privacy of non-
violent people such as drug users & sellers. For them, I would go to
jail; for you, I would even cooperate with the BATF (which should be
defunded 100%, IMO). Violence begats violence which begats even larger
government, don't start us on that road -- leave me in peace.
