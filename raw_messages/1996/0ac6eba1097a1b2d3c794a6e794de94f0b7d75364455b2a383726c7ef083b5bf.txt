If the shell cases are NOT left at the crime scene, there is NO link between 
them and the crime. You are suffering from cranio-rectal inversion.

That doesn't address the fact that (1) there are billions of unstamped shell 
casing extant, (2) stamping the side of a case will weaken it and be a 
significant safety hazard, (3) stamps in the head of the case can be 
filed/scraped off, (4) cases not left at the crime scene have no value as 
evidence, regardless of any serial stamps, extractor marks, etc. Even if you can 
prove a shell was fired in a particular gun, if there is no link between that 
gun and the crime, the "evidence" is worthless. You are suffering from 
cranio-rectal inversion.

See above. You are suffering from cranio-rectal inversion.

That's BLACK powder, stupid! Also, profiling a bomber requires more than one 
crime. A profile is a psychological analysis of the patterns in a criminal's 
handiwork, and patterns cannot be clearly deliniated with a single crime.

Yeah, and lets make it mandatory for everyone to accept subcutaneous transponder 
implants monitored by your system. Can anyone say BIG Brother? Regardless of the 
system, some poor schmuck (or an army of them) is going to have to do the data 
entry work for your computer, or it is worthless. Remember the GIGO concept?

The fact that the current government despises the intent of the people who wrote 
the Constitution and tries to circumvent and negate it to the maximum extent 
possible is the root of much of the disillusionment with and distrust of 
government in America today.

Ted Kennedy's car has killed more people than Tim McVeigh's guns.

See my sigfile. These are shining examples illustrating why an armed populace is 
critical to freedom, even if some people do misuse firearms. I would rather be 
armed and take my chances against a crackhead looking for someone to mug than be 
disarmed and take my chances against government thugs who have discovered that 
they can act against the populace with impunity.
