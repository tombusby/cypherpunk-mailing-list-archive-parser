This is true.  We definitely could use more remailers outside the US.
Especially since we all know that if you have enough money, you can
get away with murd^H^H^H^Hanything in this country,possibly even getting
access to remailer records.

Some of the cypherpunk remailers already sort of do this.  However, the only
thing it really does is make it a little harder to do traffic analysis.
The main problem with your scheme is that all of the remailers would have
access to the final destination of the message.  The best method is still
to use a randomly selected group of remailers for each anonymous message,
and change your reply block on your nym often.
