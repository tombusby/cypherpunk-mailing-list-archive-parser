"Latency" is not necessary for mix security. What is important is the
number of messages mixed together in the mix. If it is desired that N = 10
and only 10 messages are entering the mix per hour, then, on average, the
mix must wait an hour. E.g., "latency = one hour." If however, 100 messages
are entering the mix per hour, then "latency = 6 minutes."

None of these points is necessarily true.
