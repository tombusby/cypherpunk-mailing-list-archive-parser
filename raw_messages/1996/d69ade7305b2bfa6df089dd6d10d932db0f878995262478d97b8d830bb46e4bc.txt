   THE SEVENTH CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERS, FREEDOM, AND PRIVACY
                Call for Participation
        San Francisco Airport Hyatt Regency Hotel
                Burlingame, California
                   11-14 March 1997

CFP97: Commerce & Community will be sponsored by the Association for
Computing Machinery SIGCOM and SIGSAC. The host institutions will be
Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley.
Co-sponsors and cooperating organizations include the ACM SIGCAS, the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Center for Democracy and Technology, the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, and the WELL.

CFP97: Commerce & Community is the latest in a series of annual conferences
assembling a diverse group of experts and advocates from the domains of
technology, business, government, and academia to explore the evolution of
information and communication technologies and public policy, and its
effects on freedom and privacy in the United States and throughout the
world.

Past CFP sessions have discussed, debated -- and often anticipated -- issues
of great social import.  In this tradition, CFP97: Commerce & Community will
examine the social and policy questions posed by:

* the growth of electronic communities;
* electronic commerce and the commercialization of cyberspace;
* the problems of legal and regulatory control of the Net;
* the interests of privacy and property in the electronic domain;
* high-tech law enforcement and security concerns.

The CFP97 Program Committee invites your suggestions for presentations on
these or other important issues at the nexus of technology, business, public
policy, freedom, and privacy.

Proposals may be for individual talks, panel discussions, debates, moot
courts, moderated, interactive sessions or other formats.  Each proposal
should be accompanied by a one-page statement describing the topic and
format.  Descriptions of multi-person presentations should include a list of
proposed participants and session chair.  Proposals should be sent by e-mail
to cfp97@cfp.org. If necessary, typewritten proposals may be sent to:
CFP'97, 2210 Sixth Street, Berkeley, CA 94710.

Please submit your proposal as soon as possible.  The deadline for
submissions is 1 October 1996.  (Please note that we have extended our
deadline for submissions)
