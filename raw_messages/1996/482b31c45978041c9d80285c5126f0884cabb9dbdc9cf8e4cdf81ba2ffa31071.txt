Question:   Do we really WANT to advertise the location of machines?  Especially to an accuracy commensurate with current technology?  And if lying is possible, what's the point?!?

BTW, the cheapest GPS receivers (Magellan 2000's, as I recall) at $200 at the local marine supply shop. Excellent price.  Even so,  I won't buy one when I get my first GPS reciever, for two reasons:

1.  No differential capability.  (will improve accuracy to typically 2 meters)
2.  Only two digits past the "minutes" decimal point resolution.
