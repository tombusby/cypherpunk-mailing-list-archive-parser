Is providing false documents to a notary criminal fraud, or only civil?

Notary fees can be agreed contractually between the notary and the CA;
if they want to do a list price / street price system, or a non-profit,
or a dog-eat-capitalist-running-dog competitive system, the market can
let you pick your favorites.

Letting the user decide whom to trust certainly seems like the best
approach, and makes it possible to build a Web of Trust on top of Netscape
rather than being stuck with hierarchical certifications.
Meanwhile, if Netscape wants to sell the top two slots in their
CA list to the highest-bidding advertiser like they do with searchers,
they still can.
