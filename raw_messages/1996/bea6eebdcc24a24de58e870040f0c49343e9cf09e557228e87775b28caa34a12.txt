Thanks to the post in C++ we now have a version of the Noise Sphere
program in Java. You can see it at:
	http://www.golfweb.com/cmcmanis/noise.html
The source is online as well. It currently plots the randomness of the
java.util.Random class. Modification for other classes that generate
random data should be easy, as long as the class has a method
nextInt() which returns a new random number. Other hacks are possible,
feel free to hack away at your leisure.
