Incorrect. Netscape Navigator is as much commercial software as Microsoft
Word, It is NOT freeware and if he pirates it without permission he's at
least in violation of copyright which almost every country is a signatory
to. Where I come from we call that "theft". Your ethics may vary in
California.

True, but you have to agree to the licensing warning on the box (and let's
not do the tired shrink-wrap licensing argument again, please--it's on the
outside of the box).

That no more gives you the legal right to violate ITAR after purchasing, or
violate the license terms, than buying fertilizer gives you the legal right
to make bombs in violation of the AT&F code. (No wise-guy complaints about
how software isn't a bomb--though some I've bought clearly is :-). It's an
analogy about principles, not function.)

I didn't say you couldn't do it. In fact I said the opposite--that I had no
doubt it would leak. My point was that it wouldn't become mass-market
software overseas because the leakers would be violating ITAR or copyright,
or licensing and thus couldn't get away with selling or giving away the
result at scale overseas. As Jeff pointed out, getting a licensed copy of
Navigator does NOT include redistribution rights (unless you buy a site
license directly from them--and they won't sell a site license for the US
version for overseas use in violation of ITAR). In this respect it is
significantly different from PGP or RSAREF. for which there ARE at least
some redistribution rights under the license.

"Nyaah, nyaah, you can't catch me" doesn't mean that if they do they won't
prosecute. Your waving around that stuff in France is not only juvenile,
but also may put you in violation of French crypto law. That you can get
away with 80 in a 55 mile zone until the cops see you doesn't mean 80 is
legal nor that everyone else can do it with impunity.

There's no law against meeting, and customs inspectors aren't expected to
launch interrogations to see what you told them if you're not on some watch
list. Like many laws, this one might be used if something egregious
happens. If the Russian got caught later with US Netscape by French
authorities, and it came to the attention of US authorities that he said
"Tim May gave it to me", THEN you might expect to "assist the police with
their enquiries".

Again you make the long-discredited straw man argument that the purpose of
ITAR is to hermetically seal. It is not. It is to keep legitimate US mass
market purveyors from selling strong crypto overseas, and to provide a
means to punish those who are caught violating it.

I'm sure there are lots of tax cheaters. That doesn't mean the IRS code
should be abolished (though I'd like to see massive simplification for
other reasons). I'm sure there are still thieves. That doesn't mean we
should make theft legal. I'm sure there are still those who cannot read.
That doesn't mean teaching reading is useless or silly or should be stopped.

Nobody disputes that. It won't be readily available though, except for
those who have no compunctions about software piracy.
