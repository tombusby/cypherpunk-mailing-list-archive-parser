I do this too.  Until recently, it was trivial for a server to either force
the browser to download something via FTP and record the e-mail address or use
the infamous Javascript hack.  I currently have Netscape setup to disable Java,
and issue warnings whenever sending a form via e-mail or accepting a cookie.
I think this will prevent my e-mail address from being revealed to any server,
but it is not enough to satisfy my paranoia.  I would be truely satisfied if
Netscape would prompt for an e-mail address whenever it sends mail or post to
usenet.

Definitely.  Although they will never be as secure as anonymous remailers
(messages can not be delayed), this will be much better protection against
information gatherers.
