Ummm. We're being Hallam-Baker PhD'ed again.

I think she was a little bit Tory. Conservative, maybe? Right wing? Funded
by industry? On kissing terms with Reagan? Socialist, no. Or was this an
attempt by Doctor Sarcasm at wit?

Actually the UK is now way ahead of the rest of Europe in terms of
deregulation, low labor costs, efficient manufacturing, etc. Germany and
France are now up the familiar creek because of their too-socialist
policies. But there are those who say that Thatcher's slash and burn
approach was appalling.

You get the government you deserve, but not necessarily when you deserve
it. That's what causes all the fuss.
