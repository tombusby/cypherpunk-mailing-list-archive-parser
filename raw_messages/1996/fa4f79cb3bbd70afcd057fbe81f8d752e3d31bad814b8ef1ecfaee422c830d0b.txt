Fine, but that doesn't address the point missed by the original
article, which is that you don't need to precompute this stuff.
It's easy to compute in real time (under a second) which
eliminates the perturbations issue.  You don't need to worry
about inability to predict those if you're not predicting but
rather measuring/correcting in real time.
