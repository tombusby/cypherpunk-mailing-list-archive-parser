What protects each user's one time pads ("PCX Nvelopes", or whatever) ?  

Are they protected by an eight-character Unix account password ?  (This would 
be harder for implementations on traditionally single-user platforms like the
Macintosh and most of the Microsoft OSes, presumably.) 

Are they protected by a policy that says all users must lock away their IPG
disks or CDs when not in use ?  

Also, how are they protected from the people who generate the one-time pads
at IPG (and their friends and families) ?

As I said earlier, I read all your material and still had almost no idea
at all about what it is. If you don't tell people about the system, it's
extremely hard for them to do more than speculate.

Keys ?  Wait a minute, #2 of the "Dozen Reasons why PCX Nvelopes is
absolutely the finest Communication Security and Privacy system available",
according to http://www.netprivacy.com/ipg/dozbest.html, is:

"2. No Messy, Intrusive Passwords/Encryption Keys to get in your way and
worry about, forget about those troublemakers"

I'm not sure what you mean by "irregular" in this context.

This doesn't quite jibe with my understanding of the typical use of a hardware
RNG. From what I have read, one starts with an unpredictable bit source with
some known bias, so that each original bit has somewhat less than one bit of
real entropy. The bias is "corrected" by combining the original bits to get
fewer bits with enough real entropy, and then repeating the process enough to
get enough final bits of real entropy. 

Could you explain what the acronyms "ADC" and "LOB" mean here ?  I
just tried a web search for the two together, and all I got was a page of
UFO acronyms, and some astronomical acronyms (LOB = Lick Observatory 
Bulletin). Schneier discusses hardware RNG at length in Applied Cryptography,
but he doesn't mention either acronym. I might guess that LOB = Low Order
Bits.
