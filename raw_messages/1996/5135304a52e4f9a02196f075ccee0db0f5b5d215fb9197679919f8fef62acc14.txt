An interesting little piece of CGI code, but the demo leaves a bit to be
desired.  The demo is for bank checks.  The order form has you sending your
bank information (including bank number and check info) in the clear. So the
hooks into your credit card are not sent in the clear, but the ones to your
bank are...  Double plus ungood.

It is a start...  How good of one, I am not certain though...
