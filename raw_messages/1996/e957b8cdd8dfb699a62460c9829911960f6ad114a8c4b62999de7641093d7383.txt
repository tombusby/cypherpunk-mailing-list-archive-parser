This states that some  anonymous remailers are run by various gov't 
and that encryption keys up to 1000 bits are crackable.

Whether this is true or disinformation, you are using a 1024 bit key
and all your messages through anonymous remailers are encrypted
aren't they?

Also note that while later versions of PGP are capable of larger 
keys, that these versions of PGP are not known to be secure. PGP 2.3a 
is the last version released prior to gov't interference.

PGP 2.3a will do 1264 bit keys if you enter 1264 in the box instead 
of the number it askes for when if asks for the type of key security 
you want.

>entitled "Anonymous Remailers as Risk-Free International Infoterrorists"
>the questions was raised from audience (Professor Chaarles Nesson,

>as this would be a perfect target to scan possibly illegal messages.

>Both presenters explicitly acknowledged that a number of anonymous
>remnailers in the US are run by government agencies scanning traffic.
>Marlow said that the government runs at least a dozen remailers and that
>the most popular remailers in France and Germany are run by the

Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her
youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. There she lusted after her
lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emissions
were like that of horses. So you longed for the lewdness of your youth,
when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.

I like cats, probably more than I should. They are cute, 
cuddly and kill things and then lay them at my feet 
in tribute.
