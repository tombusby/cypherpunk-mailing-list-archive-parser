They support a bill which is aimed at easing the restrictions for the uses
of cryptography.  Judging from what I have read from their positions, they
view the bills as having more positive effects than negative effects.
(Which may or may not be true...)

I think that you are infering evil intent where there is no evidence of
same.  The bill does have some major flaws, but it also has some major
advantages.  Being the cynic that I am, I think that the "use of crypto in a
crime" provisions are a big negative.  Others are not nearly as cynical however.

Posting in all caps will not help you convince people of the correctness of
your position.  Claiming conspiracys involving people who have better
reputations for supporting crypto than yourself will not help either.

If I were to charge people with complicity in conspiracy, yours would be one
of the first in line.  (Though a pretty lame one at that...  Trying to smear
people who have actual reputations with juvinile assertions and b1ff style
postings is not the way to win the hearts and minds of the Cypherpunks(tm).)

BTW, good luck in trying to boycott AT&T.  They own alot more than you can
imagine.  "You Will!  And the people to make you do it -- AT&T!"
