Nope, afraid not.  We keep the credit card numbers on a non-Internet
computer.  The only communication between it and the Internet world is a
proprietary *batch* protocol.  If you break through multiple firewalls
to our most secure Internet machine, then you can begin
reverse-engineering the batch protocol, and even then, there's nothing
in the protocol that will send credit card numbers back over.  

As to how the credit card numbers are entered:  they are entered at
account setup time via a telephone call.  Yes, telephones can be tapped,
but it's really hard to set up an automated attack that taps all the
phone calls and retrieves all the credit card numbers.  Moreover,
eventually we hope to have the credit card numbers downloaded directly
from the credit card issuing banks, thus elminating even the telephone
vulnerability.

Believe me, we've thought a LOT about this.  Please check out our
academic paper on our first year of operation, which you can find at
http://www.fv.com/pubdocs/fv-austin.txt -- I think it will answer a lot
of your questions.  -- Nathaniel
