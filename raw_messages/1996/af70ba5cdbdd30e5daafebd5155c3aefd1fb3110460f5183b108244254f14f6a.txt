Hi,

As it seems to be an almost daily event of hearing of a government authortity
infringing on the liberty of Internet Users throughout the world I would like to
present the following proposal:

The establishment of an Internet Service Provider Legal Fund.

All ISP world-wide would contribute to this fund. The resources of this fund would be
used for the legal fees of ISP who whish to challenge government infringements of
their users freedoms & liberties. Something like an ACLU for the Internet but on a
Global scale.

Any thoughts?
