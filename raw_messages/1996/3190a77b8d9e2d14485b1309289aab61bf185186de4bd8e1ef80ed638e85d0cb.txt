This is the double spending problem.

Given that untraceability of cards is less of an issue than with
e-cash, why not have a central registry of the owners of the cards
(which would consist of the card hashes paired with the public key
fingerprint)?  Admittedly this means the players must be on line, but
then we all know how difficult off line detection of double spenders
is.

For anyone who is _serious_ about starting work on such a game
system, I have a few pieces of Perl and Java code that would really
get you on your way - let me know if you are interested.
