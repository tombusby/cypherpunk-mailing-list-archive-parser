It is very confusing to _me_, Chip, that you are ashamed of this
or that it has shaken your beliefs somehow.  Is it that you are
not aware of the distinction between coercive "silencing of the
speaker" censorship and non-coercive "ceasing to list to the
speaker" censorship?


I would love to know the two names and three subjects.  In the
spirit of reciprocation, here is a file called "cpunks.filter" 
I have.  I currently process it by hand or with simple tcsh 
scripts.  Actually I don't actually refer to this file very 
often.
