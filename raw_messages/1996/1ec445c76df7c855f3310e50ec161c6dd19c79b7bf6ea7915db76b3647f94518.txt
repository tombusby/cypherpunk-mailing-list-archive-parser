Not if they are on the same box, simply treat the box itself as the
remailer. The internal mechanics are for the most part irrelevant to this
issue. N messages go in, N messages with (number of remailers)(# of cover
traffic/real message) messages of cover. My contention is that it does not
matter how many remailers are on a single box. It is the number of
connections in and out of the box available. The above equation is clearly
linear and therefore not what I would consider computationaly challenging.

If I may introduce some terminology (unless their is an existing stnd.),

x       number of messages
y       message multiplier
N#()    remailer number #
R#()    number of remailers on machine #
C()     number of cover messages/original messages
E#      number of connections on machine #
T()     total traffic through remailer system
$i()    cost per message, incoming
$o()    cost per message, outgoing
C       fixed cost items of operation (eg rent)

Note: each of these represent a family of functions.

My contention:

T(R#(n)) is equivalent to T(R#(N1(x), N2(x)..., Nn(x))) 

Where,

T() = R#(n)(2N#(x) + C(yN#(x)))

The term 2N#(x) represents the number of valid messages the remailer
handles. x incoming & x outgoing, hence 2x.

The total income of such a remailer:

$(T(x))=$i(x)-$o(T(x)-x)-C

It is important to recognize the profit dependancy on the input/output
message ratio. If it gets too high, you got nothing to spend on yourself.

Your contention (if I may translate):

N1(3x) is more secure than N1(x), assuming identical remailer configuration.

Do you consider N#(ax) equivalent to aN#(x)? May I inquire into your
reasoning?

This is a limitation of the mail-news gateway and not of the remailer
technology. What it points to is a serious shortcoming in mail-news gateway
software. The technology required for truely efficient newsgroup handling is
something sorely in need of work.

If the encryption technology is secure. The point I am making here is that
the encryption envelope is 'secure' only so long as nobody is trying to
crack it. Sooner or later somebody is going to decrypt your message, if not
the entire encryption system. This is synonymous with the physical model. The
paper envelope is secure as long as somebody isn't breaking the law by
tampering with the mail.

Ok. Let's for a moment assume that to send a message to
'president@whitehouse.gov' with 'Die Bill!' is a crime. Would it not be a
crime to foil a packet of encryption by inserting 'Die Bill!' messages in
clear text in the encryption block? To date, provided no attempt at actual
decryption is attempted, there is nothing in the standards that prevent this
other than digital signatures. And again, a specific program has to be
executed. A person might very well look at it as plaintext w/o ever running
digital signatures (or they just assume its always right). Would this also
be a crime?
