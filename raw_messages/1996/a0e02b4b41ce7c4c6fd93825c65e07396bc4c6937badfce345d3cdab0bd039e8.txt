When I was on the FTC privacy list a while back there were more 
details about that.  Companies would set of very commercial web sites 
oriented towards kids, for the main purpose of getting the kids to 
give information about themselves.

So imagine if somebody set up a Barney fan page with all sorts of 
links and goodies but with the encouragement (if not requirement for 
access) to fill out personal information, even personal info about 
family members.

Ok... maybe that's within one's right.  But while (most) adults would 
be suspicious, it's not necessarily so with some children...  (who'd 
give out parent's CC#'s if they knew them).

Teaching kids basic privacy issues is a whole lot better than 
legislation. (Caveat emptor aside, fraud and cons are still 
illegal...).  I haven't seen the legislation so I won't rant for or 
against it (at least not on the list) for now.
