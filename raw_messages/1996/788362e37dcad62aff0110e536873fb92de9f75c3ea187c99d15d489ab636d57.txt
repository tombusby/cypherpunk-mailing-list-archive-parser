This begs the question, "How would you conduct an efficient key signing 
given what you have learned?" I am in the process of organizing one and 
would like to get input as to the best way that this should take place.  
Should people bring key fingerprints and public keys on floppy?  Would it 
be nice to be online and grab public keys off of a key server? How would 
you conduct a nym signing?
