No. I said nothing of the kind. When people speak of "don't you believe in
her right to free speech?," I try to point out that this such a "right of
free speech" is not the issue at hand.

No, I said nothing like this. She is obviously free to speak anything she
wishes, as a citizen or as head of an organization. It is up to members
(actually: _Board_ members, as EFF is not a grassroots, member-voting
organization) to decide if her support for restricting anonymous speech is
consistent with EFF directions.

However, as I said, if the top spokesman at EFF gives indication of having
views pretty much 180 degrees out of phase with our views, it's likely
we'll speak up and oppose her (or him), and perhaps even suggest that other
EFF board members look into the matter. "Free speech" is not even an issue.

Thanks.
