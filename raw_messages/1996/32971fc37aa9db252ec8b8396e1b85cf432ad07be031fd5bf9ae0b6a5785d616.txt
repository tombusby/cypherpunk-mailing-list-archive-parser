Trojan horse.  This is the same as #1.

Zillions of trojan horses...all the same.
I guess you can call the source credit.asm, sniffer.c, capture.bas or
any number of other names, too...geez, there's another few zillion.

"...and type your CC# into a box that advertises itself as an 'insecure
foreign applet'" or some such thing.
Far as I can tell you can't hook the keyboard this way, just ask people to

applet came from.
