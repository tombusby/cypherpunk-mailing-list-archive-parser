     Tourettes was brought up to explain one small boys behavior towards 
his mother. He would (IIRC) call her a "fucking asshole", yet he didn't 
seem to have these sorts of problems around his father. True tourettes is 
not an emotional problem, it is _very_ rare, and the person with tourettes
does not curse at only one person. 

    Undisiplined brats do have emotional problems. Parents who are under 
the ignorant mis-apprehension that children do not need disipline are the
cause of more than a few of this societies problems.

     It is a disease becasuse the people who get paid to diagnois and treat 
it call it a disease? 

     Is it a crime because a cop thinks it is a crime? 

     I will admit to the possibility of ADD being a "disease", but I think 
that the number of children who really have the disease is small compared 
to the number of childern recieving drugs for it. 

     15 years ago I would have been diagnoised as having ADD. I had trouble 
paying attention in class, I spent a lot of time looking out the window. I 
was a mild behavior problem. I didn't have ADD. I was simply bored by a 
system that either taught me stuff that was irrelevant (I thought so 15 
years ago, and feel so today), that taught so badly as to seem irrelevant
(like algebra & higher math) (notice SEEM, I feel much different now), or 
taught stuff that was simply wrong (I don't remember examples now, but I 
remember calling teachers on wrong info back in HS, and getting in trouble
for it).

	Ok, so instead of arresting everyone who uses PGP as a child 
pornographer and throwing them in jail, we should arrest them, convict them
(after all, they must be hiding something with that crypto) and then throw
them in jail. Is that what you are saying?

	Hoz-a-bout we GIVE THE KIDS SOMETHING TO BE INTERESTED IN HUH? 

        NO, WE CAN"T DO THAT THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING. 
 
        Look at the difference between the numbers of ADD kids in private 
schools and public schools.

      Uh.. That was a joke. Seriously tho' There is a difference between some
one who takes Lithium to even out neurochemistry, and a person who takes 
prozac to even take the edges off. 

     One is a medical condition, one is a psychological problem.

     Last time I checked the only symptom of Bipolar Manic depression I 
didn't have was suicide ideation. I have homicidal ideation. 

     I am not joking at this point. I'd be willindg to bet that I fall
VERY near the "Manic Depressive" line. 


     I just doubt that there are more than a small percentage of people out 
there who have mental illnesses that need strong drugs to combat. More people
SHOULD just learn to deal with it. I have found a couple of things that 
really help take the edge off my problems. Regular exercise is one. I 
recently started bike riding again, and I am doing 22+ miles a day. For the 
first time in about 10 years I have been sleeping a semi-regular schedule
(about 6 hours a night) I have been exercising about 3 weeks now, so we will 
see what happens. 

     This gets into what you are about to say, but in my case I am dealing
with my problems the best I can. It would be a hell of a lot easier to simple
take that little pill and have a nice calm chemical existence. It would be 
a lot easier to allow GAK and escrow. It is much better on all levels to 
deal with it yourself as much as possible. 

     I had never used PGP until today. Yes, I had D/Led it, compiled it, and 
installed it but never published a key, nor encrypted anything. An instance 
arose where someone else insisted I use it, so I figured it out. No problems.

     Part of the reason it was no problem is that I have spent a lot of 
time figuring shit out on my own, and only asking for help when I needed it,
or to help point the way. Too many people don't want that. They want all the 
questions answered for them. They like their mental fog and feel threatened
by people who don't. 

     I'd bet that a lot of these so called "ADD" kids are the ones who ask 
the hard questions in class, the ones who threaten to wake the other students
up. Can't have that.

     Well, something we agree on anyway. 

     Again, I am not saying that there are NO ADD kids, I know one, and he is 
a mess. However, there are many kids who are labeled ADD who aren't. I know
what Speed does to a person, Been there. Liked that (remember the Manic 
Depressive? I _LIKE_ manic.), but speed is very dangerous stuff, and 
highly addicted. Got an ex-friend to testify to that. Or he would if he 
could breath.
