I'm not so sure. If you got access to advance information on
Department of Commerce or Agriculture reports and traded futures based
on them you'd be in sheep dip. I would suggest checking carefully
before trading that way.

On the other hand, it is not against U.S. law to trade non-US
securities, do foreign exchange transactions, etc, based on non-public
information.

Heh heh heh heh heh.

The laws are vague and are arbitrarily and capriciously
applied. Technical violations happen constantly. One of the mechanisms
of control the SEC has at its disposal is the fact that almost anyone
in the business they choose to target can probably be thrown in jail
for something or other.

If you are talking about the trials associated with the Boesky affair,
most defendants plead guilty rather than face multiple lifetimes in
jail. A few defendants were aquitted at trial.  However, convictions
for insider trading are not particularly rare.
