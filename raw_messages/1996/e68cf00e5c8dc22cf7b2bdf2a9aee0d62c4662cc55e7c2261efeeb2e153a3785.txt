Sorry, the response took a while: George Fernandes, who was the
industries minister at the time, is an acquaintance, so I thought
I'd get the story from the horse's mouth.

In the aftermath of the oil crisis, India was short of foreign
exchange, so it passed the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA)
under which foreign equity in an Indian company could only exceed
40% if the company was hi-tech or  produced something of critical
national importance. The government saw no reason why precious
foreign exchange should go out as profits on the sale of
toothpaste or cola. Coke claimed that its secret formula
qualified it as a hi-tech company, and so it should be allowed
100% ownership of its Indian subsidiary. The government saw no
reason why: that was easy. The Indian government wasn't asking
Coke to reveal its formula, merely dilute its holding to 40%. That one was easy.

As regards IBM, its agreement with the government of India, under
which it was allowed to operate in the country, stipulated that
it would produce here, and transfer some technology. Instead, as
the government found, all it did was sell time on second-hand
computers (1401's as I recall, and this was mid  to late '70s).
IBM was asked to either dilute, or live up to its original
agreement, which it wasn't prepared to do, so it left.

Didn't Mark Twain say that the coldest winter he had ever
experienced was a summer in San Francisco? I do agree, SF and
environs are great: but US immigration laws being what they are,
not everyone can move there -- some day, "routing around" might
make those places more attractive which have the least
restrictive immigration laws.
