Wow!!!

Have I been excessively cynical?  Perhaps, but the argument "You should 
support the Leahy bill or they will hit you with something worse" did

Now I expect the NSA to do a little tour of the halls of congress telling
the Senators "If you knew what we knew -- we would have to kill you", but
let us applaude Burns anyway.
