What is EPPI?

EPPI is the acronym for Eudora/PGP Plug-In. It is a "Plug-In" module for
Eudora for Windows. Eudora Plug-Ins are simply programs that utilize the new
Extended Messaging Services API (EMSAPI) that were introduced with Eudora 3.0.

EPPI makes it easier to use PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) with e-mail via
Eudora. Note that EPPI does not contain any encryption/decryption routines,
so it
should not violate anybody's export/import restrictions. It simply calls
the PGP executable with the appropriate command-line options in order to
perform
the requested functions. It's also 100% free! Get a copy, give it to your
friends, spread it around...
