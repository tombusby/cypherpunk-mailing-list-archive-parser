I disagree and I believe that my quote (reposted by J. Bell) of his
original statement supports me. He mentioned "ACTIONS" and he mentioned
"OPINIONS" but he relied on his "feelings" as the touchstone of reality.
More than ever I believe that he genuinely cannot understand the
difference. He still confuses his "feelings" which exist nowhere but inside
his head with "ACTIONS" which exist outside his head in the real world. 
 
He shows similar confusion as he continued to write.

I implied no such thing. If anything, I implied the opposite. Human beings
can assess reality. But they do not do so with "feelings;" they do so with
intellectual reality testing, not emoting.

If he was not ignoring "correctness" I neither know nor see where in his
original post he mentioned this. He may wish to give me a "logic lesson"
over the issue of observation, but this also seems lacking in his post.
