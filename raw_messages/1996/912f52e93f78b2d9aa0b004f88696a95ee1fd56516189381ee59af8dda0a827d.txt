They also have some information that is seriously outdated.  They have two
e-mail addresses for me that are about 2-3 years out of date.  (I wonder how
some of this information was collected.  One was from my Fidonet point
address of years back.  Not something accesable from finger.)

I wonder if those addresses are from a "finger @sitename.org" hack.  It
becomes worrysome when the methods of hackers intersect with those of
database compilers.
