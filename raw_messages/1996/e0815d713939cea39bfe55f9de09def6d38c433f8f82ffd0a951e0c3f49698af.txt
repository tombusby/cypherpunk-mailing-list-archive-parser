Yes.  This is a simpler version.  The advantage of the attack I was
describing over this attack is that an attacker doesn't have to know
how to send messages to the recipient--just where the stream of
messages is originating.

The flaw here is that only a small number of people will be willing
to plow through any volume of messages at all, in order to
occasionally get a single readable message.  There are also some
potential problems with giving the right recipient a cheap way to
determine whether or not this message is for him, without giving
anyone else a cheap way to determine this.  (An application for
``Rabin for Paranoids,'' anyone?)

If this is a small enough group, that may still be a problem.  And
the bandwidth and processing requirements are probably enough to
ensure that it's a small group.

This makes the attack only a little harder.  If the other 20 are
selected randomly, then for a stream of many messages, only one
recipient will correlate properly with sender volume and timing.  If
it's the same 20 every time for a given receiver, then the attacker
will be able to narrow the recipient down to 20 people.  At that
point, he can use other techniques (wiretaps, black-bag jobs,
TEMPEST attacks, etc.) to make his final determination.
