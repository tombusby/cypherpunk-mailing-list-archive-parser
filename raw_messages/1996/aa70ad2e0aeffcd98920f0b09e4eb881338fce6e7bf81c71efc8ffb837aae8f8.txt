WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS VIOLATION OF OUR RIGHTS? EVER HERE THAT
IN THE US VOTES ARE supposed to be *****SECRET*****??? NO MORE!

Why does the vtw cdt etc want to hand over your name to the us gov? Notice
how there's two events one on the east cost and the other on the west coast.
Why is that? So they can get more names!

And sign up for a free trip to the roundup of people who want privacy. Coming
soon to a police state near you. WHY THE FUCK DO THEY NEED TO KNOW YOUR
NAME FOR THIS SHIT??? WHY IS NO ONE ASKING THIS???

Look carefully at who's sponsoring this. Who are they, and where does
the money come from? Hint: three letters.

Notice how they don't use PGP to sign the msg? Wonder why? What does PRZ
say about this?

Is there anyone we trust involved who can answer for this?
