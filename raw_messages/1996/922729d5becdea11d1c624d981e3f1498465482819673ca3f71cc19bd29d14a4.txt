Extremist Home Page Do YOU qualify as an Extremist?  The Politically Correct,
modern definition is a person who exhibits one or more of the following
qualities: *Has an explicit philosophical base.  *Has a concise, inflexible
moral code.  *Has an ethical standard which is not relative or situational.
*Believes in a Creator God.  *Believes that life, liberty and property are
sacred.  *Is willing to stand up for these principles and beliefs.  -  The
purpose of this page is to provide some pointers to extremists who want to
gather their own information, directly from the sources, rather than accept some
non-extremist's interpretation of reality. The battle for the mind and spirit of
We the People rages on. The weapons that we face are Propaganda, Misinformation,
Rhetoric and Censorship.  Protect yourself. Ask questions. Question answers. Do
your own homework and come to your own conclusions. Then, act on those
conclusions! By Pete Celano.
