The Seymour, TX Snake Oilers just keep getting better all the time,
now that they've left Houston, or was it Boulder!
Goat-getting hype about "What is specially claimed as copyrighted and or
patentable"
(blatantly incorrectly using those terms, and forgetting to include trademarks),
several amusing new product names, bombastic claims about speed and
strength, anecdotes about things he heard Dr. Von Neumann Himself say,
and a sum-of-Linear-Congruential generators algorithm which is
not only breakable but far slower than RC4 or RC5 or OTPs about which
he's said less recently than before.
And hardware random number generators achieving multiple
megabytes per second of random numbers on a simple serial port!

>Note: The zipped files are considerably larger than the original

UnAuTHorIZed ReproDUCTion and DIS-SEMINATION Are STRICTLY ProHIBiTeD!
Yee-Hah!

P.S. Ralph - you now owe us the keys to your company (Percy still gets his 10%),
plus all your remarkably copious Slack!
