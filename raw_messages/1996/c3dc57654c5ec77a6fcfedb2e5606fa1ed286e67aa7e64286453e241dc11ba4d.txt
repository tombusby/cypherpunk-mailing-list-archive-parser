>	 Just this week, Intuit and America Online said a number of  
>leading financial institutions would offer their customers 
>online banking via AOL, using software developed by Intuit 
>known as BankNOW. 
>	 At an Internet and Electronic Commerce conference in San  
>Francisco this week, Intuit Chairman Scott Cook said the new 
>service targets people who want to use electronic transactions 
>to speed up their banking. 
>	 Cook said he expects the new service will differ from what  
>the IBM-led consortium might provide. 
>	 NationsBank has been among companies frequently mentioned  
>as participating in the IBM consortium, but a spokesman late 
>on Friday declined to discuss a Wall Street Journal report 
>that it would be involved in the consortium.
