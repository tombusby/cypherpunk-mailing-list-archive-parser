What Mr. Takkar says isn't law, plus he's gone. The law clearly
holds ISPs responsible for
content: when it suits the government it will pull it out.
Doesn't even have to be the government: some headline-seeking
opposition politician could take the government to task because
the government-run ISPs aren't complying with the law.

And please don't get lulled into complacency by a stupid law that
isn't being enforced: in 1975, Indira Gandhi pulled out a host of
them to *legally* impose dictatorship.

every time I want a BANNED page -- I'd say it's worth it. In the
process of accessing it, I also show it to everyone in Asia, thus
giving the banned stuff much more publicity than it otherwise
would get on the net.

Governments everywhere (see Declan's long list) seem to think
they can separate out the porn and subversion from the "rather
more". Just as in the German case, where the Zundel-site was
mirrored so that Germans could access  it, external measures to
help Singaporeans access what they like would certainly help
their government "see sense."

Guess I'll risk being accused of indulging in cliches when I cite
the famous Niemoeller quote once more which begins, " First they
came for the communists, and I did not speak out, for I was not
one"... and ends "And then they came for me. There was no one
left to say anything..."

Freedom is won and lost in inches, and you have to fight every
single inch they try to take away.
