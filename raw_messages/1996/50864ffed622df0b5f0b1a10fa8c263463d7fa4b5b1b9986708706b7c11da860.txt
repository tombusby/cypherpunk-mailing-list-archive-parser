I like the idea, but they've never covered anything other than Usenet,
and newsgroups I don't read.

The little feedback we've gotten after putting it in Gnus indicates
either that it is not useful, or that it probably hasn't reached
critical mass yet.

I proposed GroupLensing this list to Brad early this year, but he
never followed up on it.

To the luser who unsubscribed last week after complaining about his
wimpy mail program, I would add:
Gnus runs on Emacs 19.34 which fully supports Microsoft Windows and is
available as a precompiled binary, so there is no excuse for using
mail and newsreading software on that platform without threading,
sorting, kill files, etc.  Add in the mailcrypt package and an
up-to-date copy of Raph's remailer list, and you have basically point
and click access to remailer chaining and PGP.

What are the last two letters of "doesn't" and "can't"?
Coincidence?  I think not.
