If they wanna bombard the net, fine.  Just as long as they don't use one 
of those HAARP gizmos, like the ground-penetrating radar, and turn it 
onto a wide area, so everyone in, say, San Jose loses all their hard 
disk info and floppy backups.  I don't know much about non-magnetic 
technology, and so I wonder what the options are for secure backup, 
short of buying an expensive safe or a spot in an underground vault?
