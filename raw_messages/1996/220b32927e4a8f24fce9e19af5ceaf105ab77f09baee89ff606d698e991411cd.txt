Since I wrote most of the dispatch M. Nuri is talking about, I'll take a
moment to respond to his points below.

First, neither Brock nor I intends to "harass" the blocking software companies.

Seocnd, I wouldn't be nearly as skeptical of their efforts if they'd
honestly admit what they block. Right now, parents don't _know_ the extent
to which Junior is kept from educational and political sites.

This was the point of the article; I fear you missed it entirely.
