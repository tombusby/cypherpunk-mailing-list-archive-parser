     Yes I do recall some of those statements.  Since you
feel that those 'attacks' were inappropriate, is it not
intellectually dishonest to engage in such 'attacks' 
yourself?  If it was wrong for them, how can it be right
for you?  
     If your age, sex, sexual preference, race, ethnicity,
mother tongue, nationality, etc. are irrelevant to the 
discussions on this list, what possible justification is
there for you to raise such issues in my case?

To which you replied:

     This is truly a non-sequitor. I am sure you know 
better than this.  Tim May is responsible for his actions;
you are responsible for yours. Taken to it's logical
conclusion, if Tim were to murder a random Russian 
immigrant, you would be justified in killing a random
native American.  
     As I said before, you are obviously too smart to 
seriously entertain such an irrational viewpoint. Thus
it is difficult to draw any conclusion other then that
you are rationalizing your inappropriate behaviour.

     Actually, I read it quite thoroughly.

     Again, would you please explain the logical basis
for committing the same abuses you cite from others?  I
would think you would seek to distance yourself from such
behavior, rather than to exceed it.  The inappropriate 
abuse of the 1000 members of this list by others can in no 
way excuse their further abuse by you.

     No, I want intellectual honesty. But even if I look 
upstairs from toad.com and find intellectual dishonesty, 
how would that in any way mitigate your apparent 
intellectual dishonesty? Are you arguing that one is
somehow dependent on, or the result of the other?  This
makes no sense to me.  Does it to you?

     The above does not appear to make sense. Did you leave
something out? It is unclear to me how rude and provocative
personal attacks and broad, unkind generalizations about 
Cypherpunk list members defends freedom of speech, protects
privacy or promotes cryptography. Would you please explain
the rationale behind your actions?
