Following my new policy on Jim Bell posts, the below represents my new 
form of reply.  These 'terse' replies should cut down on bandwidth and 
still serve as some basic protection to the list readership as to the 
mis and dis-information which eminates in quantity from Mr. Bell's 
account.  Those parties interested in a more detailed discussion, aside 
of course Mr. Bell, should ask for clarification where they feel it 
necessary and I will then expound on my points.

You are incorrect.

You are, again, incorrect.

You need to study the history of this structural decision.

You need to study the difference between non-executing and self-executing 
treaties.  It is left as an exercise to the reader to determine why, in 
this context, what Mr. Bell suggests would not work.

Se above reference to self-executing treaties as to why Mr. Bell is again 
passing the wrong mark.
