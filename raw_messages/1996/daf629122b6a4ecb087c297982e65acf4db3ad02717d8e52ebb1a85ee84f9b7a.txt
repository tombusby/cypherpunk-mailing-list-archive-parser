And I am new here, so doubly sorry for the same reason.  But I was 
corresponding with Via Crypt on this same point and here is a copy of 
what they sent me.

Dear Sir:

Eric Nesson here at ViaCrypt has shared your email inquiry with me, and I
thought I should contact you to provide you with some clarification and more
information.

The post you read on alt.security.pgp is in reference to *new types of keys*
that ViaCrypt PGP can create.  This means that, in addition to the PGP keys
that we have all been using for a long time now, ViaCrypt PGP can also create
keys with some special attributes.It is these *new types of keys* that are not
recognized by the existing freeware PGP.

You can continue to use your existing keys with ViaCrypt PGP 4.0.  And you can
create new keys that are fully interoperable with all the older PGP's out
there.  It is only when you generate a new key and turn on one of these special
attributes that it becomes unrecognizable by the existing freeware PGP.

These special attributes I refer to are:

1. "This key can be used for encryption/decryption only.  It cannot be used for
digital signatures."
2. "This key can be used for digital signatures only.  It cannot be used for
encryption/decryption."

We call keys with this special attributes 'single-function keys'.

I hope this answers your questions.  If not please do not hesitate to ask.

Best Regards,
David Barnhart
ViaCrypt Product Manager
