 I have read the file (I have all Phracks from the beginning.  Crypt is
 good too, but they dont have the same level of information as Phrack) 
 and I though that it was very inciteful (sp).

 I am saying that hackers do break into computers, but crackers are more
 malicious in their intent.  And yes, pathetic hackers rely on programs.
 I have respect for hackers who do all the work themselfs.
