What if John didn't prevent him "suvscribing", but instead directed his 
software to simply send messages from Vulis back to him as though they were 
sent to the list, but in fact did not forward his messages to the rest of 
the list.  Vulis would continue to (spit) and (fart) on the list, would 
assume everyone else saw it, but would not see any replies to his spew.  
His remailer (spits) would still get through, but think how much less noise 
there would be.

Alternatively, he could just moderate the list and not forward his rantings 
at all.  LOTS more work, but still feasible.

All I'm saying is that it *is* possible for John to censor Vulis from this 
list if he was so inclined.
