I completely disagree here!

Taking into account the philosophico-political context there, it
*obviously* indicate a *complete* understanding of the nature of the
net.  It is you (the writer of the forwarded article) who did not
either dare to state or simply recognize the true nature of a govt
pushing such measures. 

I am fed up of seing net users giving every would-be dictator the
benefit of the doubt.  There is no tolerance to be applied to that. 
There is no such thing as being tolerent to poison.

Why don't we start naming things by their true names?
