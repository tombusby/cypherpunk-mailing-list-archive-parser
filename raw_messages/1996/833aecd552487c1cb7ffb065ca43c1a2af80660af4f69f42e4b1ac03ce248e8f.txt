Jim,

Thank you for doing this.  I went to Law School to bring a viewpoint 
to the bench that was never there.  I do so whenever I can.  What you 
are doing is a very important part of moving this country forward.  I 
understand the people who [RANT] about the problems we face, but when 
people like you hold a civil discourse with officials we overcome the 
label of extremists.

Once again, thank you for all you are doing.
