Steptoe and Johnson have kindly posted the draft Commerce Department
regulations on encryption exports at http://www.steptoe.com/commerce.htm.

Of most interest to those of us concerned about the First Amendment is the
provision which eliminates the "publicly available" exception to the EAR and
states "controlled software will not be eligible for "publicly available"
treatment, even if the source code or object code is published in a book or
other mdia."

It also eliminates the exceptions for educational information and
fundamental research contained in the EAR for source code and object code.

I haven't had a chance to review the rest in any detail.
