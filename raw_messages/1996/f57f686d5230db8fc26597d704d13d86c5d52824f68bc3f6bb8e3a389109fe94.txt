Just to make it clear, the _least_ of _my_ reasons for having a satellite
dish and televisions in general is to "get info." (Though even when I do
want to "get info," I tend to turn to CNN, CNBC, PBS, etc., and not to use
the generally short summaries that are carried on the Net, sans video of
course.)

I won't argue for television pro or con...I'm sure most folks here have met
people who are religiously anti-television and who radiate superiority in
pointing out that the last time they saw a television program was when
"Nicholas Nickleby" was broadcast. Whatever.

But having both a video/satellite system and, obviously, a Net/Web system,
they are very different things.

To each their own.
