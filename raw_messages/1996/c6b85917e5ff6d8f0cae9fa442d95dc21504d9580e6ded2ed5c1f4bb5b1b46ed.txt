I read Tim's comments with enthusiasm, as I think we agree on many 
things.  I, as well, wish for a world where there is crypto so
heavily proliferated that all the regulations in the world cannot
either hinder or help get it into the hands of the public.

In the meantime, Tim advocates putting good code out there for people
to use, racing to the point of no return.  I don't disagree, but that's
not where my talents lie.  Mine lies in keeping Congress from doing damage
today, a strategy which Tim may call very short term (getting good code
out and well-deployed is long term) but hey, it's what we do.

Let's hope we both arrive at that end in time to retrospect about
strategy.  I must agree though, watching legislation is a lot like
watching sausage being made...
