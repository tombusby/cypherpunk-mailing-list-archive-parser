Wei:

I didn't see your original post, but did see Deranged's response.  I
would be interested to see whatever you come up with.

The reference implementation is TERRIBLE for small caches.  You can
shrink it significantly, however, by simply looping 4x across code
that does the basic round operation for each of the 8 rotations --
something like:

  for( i = 4; --i; )
  { FF_1(t7, t6, ...);
    FF_1(t6, t5, ...);
    FF_1(t5, t4, ...);
    FF_1(t4, t3, ...);
    FF_1(t3, t2, ...);
    FF_1(t2, t1, ...);
    FF_1(t1, t0, ...);
    FF_1(t0, t7, ...);
  }

The basic macro for this is almost unchanged from the reference
implementation.

You can shrink it even further by, instead of coding the basic macro 8
times for each round, writing a round step that works on an array of 9
words (out of an array of 16), using 8 words as input and producing
the ninth as output.  You then have a two-level loop that invokes this
4x8 times, walking your working set 1 element in the array each time,
and every 8 passes moving the 8 current variables back where they
belong.

The first pass through the loop, you use elements 15..8 as input, and
produce element 7.  The second pass, you use elements 14..7 as input,
and produce element 6, etc.  After 8 passes, you move elements 7..0
back up to 15..8, and start the inner loop over.

Alternatively, you can begin with an array of 40 words (only 8 of
which contain data), use a single loop that invokes the basic
processing 32 times, walk your working set 1 word each time, and only
move the working set back where it belongs at the end of the full
round.
