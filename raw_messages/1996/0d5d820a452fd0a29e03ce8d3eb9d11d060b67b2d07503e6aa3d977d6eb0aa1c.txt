No need for any new laws or regulations, all that needs to be done is
to add crypto to the import list (the opposite, and currently not so
widely discussed counter part to the export list).

In fact I wouldn't be suprised if the ODTC and NSA could interpret
ITAR and the current import list to allow this.  (Anyone have an
electronic copy of the import restricted list?)

Of course this wouldn't be a very popular move, so I'd guess that it
wouldn't be tried until a) foreign crypto apps become a significant
obstacle to the NSA, and b) other methods have been exhausted.
