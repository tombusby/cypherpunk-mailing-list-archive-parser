I would assume that the filters look for regexp's in the query string, too.
How about a nice little Nutscape plugin that uses a rot13'd query string?

Hmmm, no bad words in the query string.  Of course the filter package would
start looking for rot13'd stuff in the next release.  So the next logical
step is to use the URL encrypted with the redirector's public key ... or
better yet, a dynamically generated key.  Just convert it to radix64 so
as to avoid ?'s &'s or ='s, and use that as the query string.  

The plug-in would only be necessary to generate the first request.  Any
URL preparation could be handled by passing the output of netcat through
a stream filter before sending it to the client.

Now, if I can get the time, maybe I will write a nice little redirector
to do this.  (hehehehehehe ... right ... get the time ... good one)
