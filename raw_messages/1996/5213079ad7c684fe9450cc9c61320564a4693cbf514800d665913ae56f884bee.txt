My warmest thanks to Blanc Weber for 'beating me to the
punch' about 'Sir Galahad's' thoughtful analysis. His post
is the sort of give and take which focuses debate and
raises the level of intellectual discourse. Thank you, 'Sir
Galahad' and Blanc Weber. I hope other posters to this list
can emulate your examples.
