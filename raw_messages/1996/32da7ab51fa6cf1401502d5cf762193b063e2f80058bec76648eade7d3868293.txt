No, what it marks is a growing understanding.  When I said that, over a
year ago, I still thought that software encryption of credit card
numbers could be a workable solution.  I no longer do, based primarily
on my very recent realization that we could mount a multi-stage fully
automated attack on such systems.

This is wrong on two main counts:  the ID's are harder to find than
credit cards, and they're not as directly useful as credit cards.  These
two facts combine to make the attack more or less irrelevant to FV.

First of all, the Virtual PIN (FV-ID) is much harder to extract from a
large data stream because it is arbitrary text, unlike credit card
numbers, which are self-identifying.

Second, a Virtual PIN is not a one-way payment instrument, like a credit
card.  To use FV to buy something on your credit card, you need to
combine the theft of a Virtual PIN with the compromise of the buyer's
email account, for confirming transactions.  We all know this can be
done -- we actually even spell out how to do it in our paper, "Perils
and Pitfalls of Practical CyberCommerce" -- but it is very hard to
combine these steps on the large scale that would be needed to mount an
automated attack, which is the most serious threat to the credit card
system.

I hope that I jut did.  My guess is that you didn't understand the email
confirmation that is required for every purchase in the FV system.  For
