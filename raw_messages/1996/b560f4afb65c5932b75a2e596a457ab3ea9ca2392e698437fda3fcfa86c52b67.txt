Richard's excellent work might be kaliedoscoped with a view of the
Index of 5,000 crypto-related "high-interest" files declassified by NSA 
under the OPENDOOR program. See NSA's home page for a link to 
the awesome list of devices, codes, messages, betrayals, tricks, lies 
and unsung wizards from 1916 through 1945. Just a tiny preview of
what yet squats locked in the crypto-crypt of NSAK-America.


We've put the Index at:
