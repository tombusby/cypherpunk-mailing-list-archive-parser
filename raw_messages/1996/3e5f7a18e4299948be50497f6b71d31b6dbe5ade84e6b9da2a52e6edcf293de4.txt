I'm speaking at the Catholic University Law School about online
speech/crypto/copyright issues at 6:30 pm today. Anyone in DC is welcome
to stop by; the talk will be in the Columbus School of Law. 

Also tonight at 8 pm I'll be Brock Meeks' guest on the debut of his ISP-TV
show, "Meeks Unfiltered." We'll be talking about what the U.S. elections
mean to the Net. We plan to argue about universal service as well.
