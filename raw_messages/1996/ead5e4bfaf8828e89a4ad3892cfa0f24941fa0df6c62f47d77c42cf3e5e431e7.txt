The right answer depends on the types of attacks you're interested in
countering. The classic reference is probably Voydock and Kent's
"Security Mechanisms in High Level Network Protocols," from Computing
Surveys in 1983. I think Stallings recently put together collection of
paper reprints for IEEE Press that included this one.

This paper is particularly nice since they present various streaming
modes and then talk about the vulnerabilities associated with them.
So it's not crypto algorithms so much as how to use them.
