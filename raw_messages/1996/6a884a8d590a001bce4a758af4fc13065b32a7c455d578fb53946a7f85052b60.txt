At last!  Somebody bringing up the topic!  I am quite recent on CPunks, 
but I've been trying to push that point on alt.security.pgp and alt.privacy
some time ago.

After several try at it, I dropped the subject.  I couldn't believe that nobody 
considered this explanation to the CDA.  The thought that many so-called 
"free speecher" were actually hired by the big media to create a big fuss
among net users over the "porn vs religious" issue just to act as a diversion 
even crossed my mind!
