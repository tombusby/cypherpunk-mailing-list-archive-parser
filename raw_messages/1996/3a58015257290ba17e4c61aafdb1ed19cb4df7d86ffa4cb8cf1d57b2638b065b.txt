Operation Sun Devil happened in 1990.  A couple of BBS' were shut down.  It
hasn't been repeated much since.  There are currently more than 7,000
commercial ISPs in the world.  At one or two shutdowns per decade, it will
take a while.  Note too that an ISP is more like a carrier (common or not)
than like a publisher.  Legal difficulties for the Feds.  Even harder in the
future when 100 million households worldwide have full-time net access
running on real multitasking workstations.

I'm waiting.  Then I'll have to call all the way to Montreal to log on.
They will have a lot of fun trying to *find* all the ISPs though.  There are
quite a few and that still leaves company, academic, government, and private
TCP/IP servers up.

There's not much government infrastructure left on the Net.  The backbone
went private the weekend after the OKC Federal building was blown up.

Defeat is a process that occurs in the mind of the enemy.  If you can
convince them not to fight, you and they are better off.  In any case, you
don't get anywhere by failing to assert your strength.  A declaration of
independence doesn't mean you are independent it is the opening shot in a
conflict by which you win (prove) your independence.

It doesn't consider itself anarchic -- it is.  The IETF reaches decisions by
consensus and the software that becomes part of what we call "the Net"
becomes a part of the Net only when a large enough number of individual
servers decide to run it.

Neither Arpanet nor the Internet were Defense Department networks.  They
were (for a while) academic networks funded (in part) by DOD and many other
sources.  Certainly when the Internet went international (when exactly did
that happen?)  the DOD became an insignificant player.

These sorts of informal negotiations of the terms of employment are quite
common in life.  Anyone could have been fired at anytime if their
supervisors didn't like what they were doing.  It is blackmail to threaten
to quit only if you are a slave who is not "allowed" to do so.  Here, we can
quit a job any time for any (or no) reason.  Certainly employers both public
and private have benefitted from the development of networking technology.

Fair use (private distribution) or published on the net by the copyright
holders themselves.

You mean like novels about the Kennedy assassination.

Well *somebody* has to do it.  Women, minorities and the differently sexed
certainly harass other people.  I thought we all had equal rights.

This obviously hasn't worked.  There's an awful lot of advertizing on the

When one goes out into the marketplace, one encounters many different people
and many challenges.  You must win acceptance from some of the other
participants you find there.  There are mores.  You have to learn some of
them or find others of your ilk who already share you mores.  It is not
hard.  It is called life.

I've never been bothered.  Tim has had the cops called on him.  We still
post at will.  A short survey of the Feed suggests that many other people
continue to post at will.  Probably too many.  In fact, they obviously feel
freer to do so on the net than in real life.

This is not a therapy group.  Compassion is a personal matter.  Certainly LD
is not noted for his compassion.

I hadn't noticed much advocacy of reading private email or turning people in
to the thought police anywhere on the Net.  Perhaps you read some unusual
mailing lists.

In modern capitalist societies like the US, it is possible to actually own
fairly powerful computers yourself.  In fact, I understand that even the
peasantry in America can put together the $200 for a used 386sx and the $39
for a 14.4K modem and run a free copy of Linux and have a powerful TCP/IP
server of their own.  The dialup connection is not permanent of course.  It
can be bought from many local, national, and overseas providers.  Encrypted
TCP/IP to out-country ISPs will make things a bit harder to track.

Severing a contractual relationship with someone (under the terms of that
contract) is not physical coercion and bears no resemblance to physical
coercion.  Those who are "disfellowshipped" by lists or ISPs can find others
who will accept them.

Actually, the ability to control group inclusion and exclusion is the
definition of one sort of a society.  You are arguing that the Net has
become a grouping of various societies and subcultures.  I agree.

We (some of we) don't want the housing or the school funding either.  I
certainly consider slave schools to be the most common form of child abuse
in the world today.

Don't go out of your way.  Just stay out of our way.  Play golf instead.

Use another domain name.  Internic doesn't even have a monopoly of domain
name assignment within the US.  If it casually screws around with too many
people, it will guarantee further loss in market share.  How, exactly, is
there going to be a massive pulling of IP addresses.  That sounds like an
awful lot of expensive litigation to me.  Court orders don't come cheap even
if the Feds do buy them wholesale.  They'll lose that predator hunt energy
balance equation as long as it costs me virtually nothing so set up a new
net presence somewhere else but it costs them $thousands per "takedown."

In this century alone, the governments of the world have murdered more than
160 million people.  The Net has very few murders to its (dis)credit.  If
flaming is the worst we ever do...

I've found JPB to be reasonably realistic for one "of the left."  This
debate is *about* who is the most "realistic" the regulators or the
anti-regulators.  So far, the regulators haven't done too well.  Time will
tell.  In any case, it's way too early to declare the game over.  As for
"realism."  One may be permitted to doubt the realism of those who expect
massive physical raids to shut down the net.  That sort of thing worked (for
a while) in commie countries but it's never even been tried here.  If they
are going to do it, they'd better do it soon before the net triples in size
again.

This happens to be how Barlow spends most of this time.  Many of us as well.

Now there's a *real* breach of netiquette.  Remind me not to give my real
address to my ISP.  Too bad their prisons are sort of maxed out with drug
dealers or they might lock up the lot of us (though one wonders on what
charges).
