> JMR sensor consists of two metal (ferromagnetic) layers  separated
> by an insulating layer.  A JMR trilayer junction tested recently at
> MIT is only 20 nm thick  and the signal (the fractional change in
> resistance) was 23%, compared to a signal of less than 7%  for a
> 40-nm-thick, 4-layer GMR prototype.  MIT physicist Jagadeesh
> Moodera (moodera@slipknot.mit.edu; 617-253-5423) suggests that
> the more compact size, relatively larger signal, and the low sub-nanoamp operating current of the JMR sensor could make for easier
> engineering of devices and lower production costs.  An areal density
