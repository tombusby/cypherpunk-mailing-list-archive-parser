Well, I know the higher-end NorTel and Lucent switches (ah la the DMS100,
200, 250, the 5ESS and the 1AESS) there are, basicly, 5 catagories... 

911, toll free (800,888,local non-metered), extra charge (900/976), and
metered.

pretty much non-metered is the only one that doesn't do the dest/src
recording (unless you've got a DNR put on your line, which usually means
the USSS/FBI are breathing down your neck.  Had it happen once. definatly
not fun.)

Of course, those switches are all programmable, so you can add more.

Only on metered calls (includeing 800/900 type) at most places.

But most of the time (ok, most numbers, not most types of numbers) it
keeps track of percentage of calls from this type of line, to this type of
line, not exact info on which lines.
