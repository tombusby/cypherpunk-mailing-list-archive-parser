With TIS bending over for the big GAK Monster in so many ways, it brings up
a question...  (A probibly off-topic one...)

Does anyone know of intentional GAK-like holes put in their Firewall
Toolkit?  They distribute it for free and distribute source, but with their
record i have little trust in the matter...  (Better yet, does anyone have
suggestions for Firewall code that will run under Linux or FreeBSD?)
