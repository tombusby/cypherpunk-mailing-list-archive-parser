Sometimes it has nothing to do with the employer. 

For example, for those of us who work on Wall Street, that is to say, 
in the financial services industry, the SEC requires that all employees submit 
to a background check, drug test and fingerprint check (National Agency Check) 
before you can be hired.  Failure to require these checks, and to refuse 
employment to those that don't pass these test, results in a very large fine 
for the employer.  This is not a one-time thing.  You must undergo these test
everytime you change jobs, even when moving from one firm to another in the 
same business.

Many of us find this an onerous process, but for the compensation, 
(top grade Sys Admins and developers can make >$250,000 per year), many of us put
up with it. This, BTW, does not apply just to traders, etc, but to everyone.  

Not only must you put up with all this bull shit, but you must also deal, 
on a daily basis, with some of the biggest assholes on the face of the earth.  
Suffering fools is just the beginning.

We do it all for, $$$, of course.

As someone once said, we are all whores, it's just a matter of determining our price.
