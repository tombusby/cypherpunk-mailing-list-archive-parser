 Argumentum ad nauseam.  The point is, Adam (I think) wanted to tell us
 he's leaving.  Well, who gives a shit, anyway?  Instead of ranting

<<I am withdrawing from this list. Not because of the volume of 
email...that I can deal with...but what I cannot deal with is the 
volume of garbage and egotistical ranting that seems so prevalent in 
what should for all sakes and purposes be a discussion of cyphering 
and security. Apparently the name of this list is designed to 
mislead...because of all the posts, a grand total of 5% proved worth 
reading at all.>>
