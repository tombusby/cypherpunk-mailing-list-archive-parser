I treated it as a generic example, not a specific one. For the record, I have
never donated to the United Way either.

I liked Zaid Hassan's response better. In general, I try not to "get with the
program" (c.f. Two Roads Diverged in a Yellow Wood" by Robert Frost). But in
spite of my best efforts, I still find myself in a well defined demographic
group. ;-)

In spite of these services the spread between Canadian and U.S. Bonds is in
favour of Canada out as far as ten years. Interest rates this morning for 90 Day
T-Bills: Canada 3.23%; U.S. 5.02%.
Remember: correlation is not causation.

Aye, there's the rub. So far I haven't *explicitly* drawn one. And the line I
may draw now is probably different from the line I might have drawn 5 years ago
or 5 years from now. Ambiguity I can accept, its ambivalence, apathy and
agnosticism that annoy me more. 
 
Tim's occasional combination of justifiable apathy tends to be the best
combination to trigger a response.
 
Ciao,

The rules of the game: learn everything, read everything, inquire into
everything... When two texts, or two assertions, or perhaps two ideas are in
contradiction, be ready to reconcile them rather than cancel one by the other;
regard them as two different facets, or two successive stages, of the same
reality, a reality convincingly human just because it is complex.
Marguerite Yourcenar quoted in Complexification by John L. Casti.
 
Les regles du jeu: tout apprendre, tout lire, s'informer de tout... Lorsque deux
textes, deux affirmations, deux idees s'opposent, se plaire a les concilier
plutot qu'a les annuler l'un par l'autre; voir en eux deux facettes differentes,
deux etats successifs du meme fait, une realite convaincante parce qu'elle est
complexe, humaine parce qu'elle est multiple.
