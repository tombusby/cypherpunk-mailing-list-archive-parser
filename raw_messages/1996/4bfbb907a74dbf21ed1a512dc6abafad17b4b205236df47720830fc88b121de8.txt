I understand perfectly what the issue is. Rich wrote an important
informational message about "MS CAPI export issue" - which raises
questions about how exactly MicroSloth got away with exporting CAPI. I
for one dearly want to hear the answer. Instead he gets a JimBell rant
about conspiracies or something (I didn't read it to the end).

He CAN'T just killfile the subject. It's HIS subject, and he wants to
read the answer. The thread is relevent. When the noise level exceeds
the threshold, even in threads which you want to read or indeed
initiated, something is fundamentally wrong. I'd unsubscribe myself,
except I can't.

ObCrypto: I think the govmint goofed, letting this out. Perhaps someone
should (anonymousely) alert the DoJ to start a grand jury to indict Bill
Gates. Someone overseas should ASAP interface PGP to it and publish it.
