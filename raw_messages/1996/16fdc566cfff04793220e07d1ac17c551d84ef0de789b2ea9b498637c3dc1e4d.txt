Packet filtering at the ISP's router. If Dimitri can't connect to a
remailer, he can't send anonymous messages. Sure there are a lot of hacks
that could be done (like have sendmail on another system send it to a
remailer) but such things could be detected and blocked by clever filters.
In fact, the ISP could just claim to be "going down for maintenance" and
completely block Dimitri from the internet for a while.

Isolating spy transmitters by selectively cutting power is exactly
alalogous to what I have suggested.
