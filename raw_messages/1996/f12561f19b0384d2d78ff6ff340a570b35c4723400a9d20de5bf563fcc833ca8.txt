And that's the REALLY ironic part!  PGP (as wonderful as it is, politically,
that Zimmermann wrote it...) is
 so frigging frustrating and difficult to use (as programs go, anyway), and
interface to, and I haven't 
even TRIED to use anonymous emailers yet  (sheer laziness on my part, I
admit).  If the government came 
out neutral about them, or "God forbid" REQUIRED us to learn how to use
them, I'd probably be proudly 
resisting their desires and ignoring the whole technology.

Makes you stop and think, doesn't it?!?
