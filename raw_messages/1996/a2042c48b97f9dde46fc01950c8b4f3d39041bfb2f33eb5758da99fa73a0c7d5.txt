I've submitted a request to unsubscribe cypherpunks from these lists.
I have also notified the operator of plaidworks.com of the problem.

While I think that his web-based list-subscription tools is neat, it's
obvious that the potential for abuse is large.  What solutions are there
for protecting us from assholes like the one who signed cypherpunks
up to all these lists?

Maybe soon all lists will require some form of digital ID from new
subscribers?
