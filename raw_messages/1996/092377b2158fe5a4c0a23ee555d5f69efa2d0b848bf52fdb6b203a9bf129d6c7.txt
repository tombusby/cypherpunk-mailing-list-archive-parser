Gosh, Dan, your friend may want to double-check. After reading Winn
Schwartau's post, I bought a copy of The Sunday Times here in NYC late
Sunday in which the article led at the top of the Front Page. 
 
 
Be glad to fax anyone a copy who may want such, ahem, verification. E-mail
me a number. 
 
 
However, I acknowledge that there is a chance that the TLAs, or Net
security/info war consultants (like Schwartau, et al) planted the article,
a fake to generate scare-funding and boost conference attendance. Or maybe
it's a classic Brit joke, a spoof  -- or a sting by the Intergalactic Net
Police. 
 
 
Strange terrorist ripoffs happen -- incredible IPOs, vaporware
millionaires, and such.
