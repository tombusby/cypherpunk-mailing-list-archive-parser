Correct me if I'm wrong: It means that the weakest point of the
digital
cash chain is the server.  If the server's database is tampered
with, or lost,
then, the double-spending can be done (in case of loss, if ever
the server is put
back online)  

Does that means that for all practical purposes, a server
should be run from a 
vault with security comparable to a big money repository?
