Not to mention 7 out of 8 bits may reveal the image to be a library one
your enemy has access to.  The changes will betray the stego.
Your own scanned snapshots may be safer from this point of view.

What about Walter making insignificant changes to the cleartext and
replacing the hash with the new hash?   Because you are using an unkeyed
hash (and not a sig) he can do that and foul up the stegomessage (not
that he'll yet be sure there is one).

Walter can still play silly spooks with your stego if he breaks the 40-bit encryption.

The cyphertext/plaintext ratio looks like getting really huge too.  Your messages
must all arrive, and retain the right order.
