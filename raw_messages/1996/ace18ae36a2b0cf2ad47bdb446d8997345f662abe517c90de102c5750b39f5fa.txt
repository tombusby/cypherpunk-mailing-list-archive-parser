Hey, Jim Bell, here are some clients, or competitors, or best, 
targets?



The Hit Men (Newsweek, Feb 26, 96)

Call it "in-your-face-capitalism." You lose your job, your ex-
employer's stock price rises, the CEO gets a fat raise. Today,
the more people a company fires, the more Wall Street loves
it, the higher its stock price goes.

Cheer up, you're serving the greater good by being blown away
by what economist Joseph Schumpeter christened "the gale of
creative destruction."

The world is changing and no matter how big and rich a company
is, it has to adapt or die. But Wall Street and Big Business
have made a bad problem worse by being greedheads. Lots of
CEOs have messed up big time. They let payrolls get bloated.
Then to recoup, the offer up employees as sacrifices to
Mammon, god of Wall Street, hoping to get their stock price
back up. When the price rises, it's like Wall Street spitting
on the victim's bodies.
