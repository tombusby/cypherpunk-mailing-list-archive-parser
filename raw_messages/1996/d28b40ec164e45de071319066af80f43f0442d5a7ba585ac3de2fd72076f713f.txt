Untill januari 1st 1996 you could trademark anything in The Benelux.
A bank (ABM*AMRO) has a trademark on 'the bank'; they essentially
upgraded a generic name into a trademark, but the recent changes made 
that impossible since the Benelux Trademark Buro has to check if a name 
is a generic name and they now have the power to refuse a registration.
