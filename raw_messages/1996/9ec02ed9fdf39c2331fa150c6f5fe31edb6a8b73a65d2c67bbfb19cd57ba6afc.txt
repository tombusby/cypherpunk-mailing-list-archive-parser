I think the Feds non-prosecution of Zimmermann had absolutely nothing to do 
with the crackability/non-crackability of PGP.  They just had an extremely 
weak case:  They probably had no way to demonstrate that any particular 
person exported PGP, which means that prosecuting Zimmermann would have 
looked like sour grapes.  (or, in the alternative, if they had records to 
show that PGP was exported, they might not have wanted to reveal the extent 
of their Internet monitoring.)
