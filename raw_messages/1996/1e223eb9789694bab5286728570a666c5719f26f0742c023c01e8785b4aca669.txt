A much better idea is to clean the barrel with a stiff wire brush. If you blue 
the inside of the barrel, and then brush the bluing off, that is enough. 
Alternatively/additionally, fire several hundred rounds with the weapon.  Either 
will change the microscopic pattern of grooves sufficiently to cause a mismatch. 
Poking a file around in the barrel is a good way to ruin a gun.

Changing barrels is a good idea as well. I can change the barrel on my Desert 
Eagle in about 15 seconds. A better idea yet is to fabricate a removable 
silencer (that can be attached/detached without modifying the barrel) with a 
wire brush surrounding the muzzle opening (similar to a batery terminal cleaner, 
but sturdier, of course) so that the bristles put their own marks on the bullet 
as it leaves the barrel. Even if the silencer is found, you will never be able 
to put it on aligned exactly the same way, and the marks will not line up 
exactly. Alternatively, you could mount the bristles on a bearing so they can 
rotate freely, so the patterns of marks constantly change as the brush rotates. 
Of course, getting caught with a silencer is a good way to go directly to jail 
without passing GO.

Of course, if you are serious about avoiding this kind of hassle, you will mount 
a bag to the receiver of your gun to catch the fired shells, so that they aren't 
lying around for curious people to find.
