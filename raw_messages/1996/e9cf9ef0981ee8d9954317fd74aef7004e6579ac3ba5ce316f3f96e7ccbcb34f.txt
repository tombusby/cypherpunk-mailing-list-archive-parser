THE LATEST NEWS

Today, a core contingent of the US Senate proposed legislation that
would free public domain software such as Phil Zimmerman's PGP (Pretty
Good Privacy), allow for the export of products that have competitive
encryption abroad, and limit the government's ability to propose
another Clipper-style standard.

The latest proposal, sponsored by Sen. Burns (R-MT) is the third in a series
of bills this year that blatantly attack the Clinton Administration's
policies of restricting the export of encryption that is already found
outside the United States.  Text of the legislation is now available on
http://www.crypto.com/ and http://www.vtw.org/ as soon as we get it.

In another bold move, Senators Conrad Burns (R-MT) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT)
have scheduled online chats to discuss this legislation with the people
who understand the issue the best: the net community.  As a part of
the Whistlestop96 campaign by VTW and CDT (Center for Democracy and
Technology) to bring members of Congress in touch with the net community 
during the 1996 campaigns, Senators Burns and Leahy will be attending
live online chat sessions on HotWired and America Online.  The schedule
as currently available is:

Sen. Burns
	America Online, News Room auditorium: Monday May 6, 9pm EST
	Hotwired: Monday May 13, 9pm EST

Sen. Leahy
	America Online: date not yet available
	Hotwired: date not yet available

In addition, volunteers have begun maintaining a resource page at

policy news.  You can subscribe to it from the WWW page http://www.crypto.com/
