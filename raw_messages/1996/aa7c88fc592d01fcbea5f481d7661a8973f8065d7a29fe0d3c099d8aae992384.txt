George Bernard Shaw, leader of the Fabian socialists, visited the 
Soviet Union during Stalin's artificial famine and said "Where do you see 
any food shortage", gesturing around.  He was sitting in a restaurant 
reserved exclusively for foreigners at the time, and there was indeed 
excellent and abundant food in the restaurant.

Monsters, plain enough.  Very simple.  The complications only exist in 
the clouded minds of those who employ doublethink.

Shaw also visited the Gulag, as did many famous English leftists:  Here is 
his report on it:

  "Whereas in Britain a man enters prison a human being, and leaves prison 
   a criminal type, in Russia he entered prison a criminal type and would
   come out an ordinary man but for the difficulty of inducing him to come
   out at all.  As far as I could make out they could all stay as long as
   they liked.
  "

I have heard many very similar tales from folk on Usenet concerning Cuba 
and the like.

In addition to eradicating everyone like me, they would also eradicate their
dupes, their useful fools, such as H.G. Wells, who wrote of Stalin:

    "[...] never met a man more candid, fair and honest, [...] no one is afraid
     of him and everybody trusts him.
    "

Since they did not give H.G. Wells a tour of the Gulag, I guess they suspected 
that he might not have approved.  Such a suspicion would doubtless have 
proved fatal had his pals amongst the Fabian socialists gained power.
