   For what it's worth department:

   The four letter words that are considered indecent are an anachronism
   from the days when the French/Normans ruled England, (~1066-1300's).
   A quick look at the words and their acceptable counterparts will make
   clear the issue. The four letter word are all of English derivation and
   the socially acceptable ones are of French (sometimes Latin) derivation.
   Even the term "four-letter" is a derogatory term for the English language
   in general, because the French considered English second rate because the
   words tended to be short, unlike French. Anyone who supports the suppression 
   of these words is merely enforcing the old French repression of the English 
   and the English language from over 500 years ago. Why think for yourself 
   when tradition can do it for you?

    eg:
      to piss  - to urinate
      to shit  - to deficate
      to fuck  - to copulate
      cunt     - vagina 
 
        etc.

     All of them, folks, all of them and easily checked out.
