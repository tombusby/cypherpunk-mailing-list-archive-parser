Fraud is fraud.  It's illegal under *some* statute, I'm sure.

Fraud.  See above.

According to the Constitution, "No title of nobility shall be granted by
the United States, and no person holding any office of profit or trust
under them shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any
present, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatsoever, from any
king, prince, or foreign state."

I would point out that the "any kind whatsoever" clause is clear enough,
and as to whether Congress approved Bush et al for these honors, well,
you tell me.

Demjanjuk.  Israel (a country where the Justice department seems to have
some ethics) was so embarrassed about this that they released him, even
though there was considerable pressure to keep him under various charges.

One could also look at the Weaver and Waco cases for false charges.
It's worthy of note that juries rejected the U.S. Justice dept's murder
charges in these cases.  The original charges in the Weaver case even
included the baby, as I recall.
