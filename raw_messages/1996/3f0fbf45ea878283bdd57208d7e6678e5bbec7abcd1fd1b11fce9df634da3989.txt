When IBM internally transfer crypto-software to locations outside US
they have to keep

* Name of sender + receiver
* date of transmission
* method of transmission


I'd assume that with this personal-use exection you have to keep the
date of your travel and the location(s) you traveled to.  (Your name
might be something you remember without keeping track of it ;-)
