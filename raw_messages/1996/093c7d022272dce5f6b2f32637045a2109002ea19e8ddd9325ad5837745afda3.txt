Bay Area California Cypherpunks Meeting
January 28
12 noon - 3 p.m.
B21, Sparcy's Cafeteria, Sun Microsystems Inc

Directions: 

Take the Rengstorff Ave East exit from 101.   If you're driving north
on 101, this exit is labeled "Amphitheater Parkway".     If you're driving
south on 101, this exit is labeled "Rengstorff".   At the end of the exit
ramp, turn left onto Garcia.   After .4 mile, turn right onto Marine Way.
After .1 mile, turn right onto Coast.   Building 21 is right there.  
Look for the big purple and white sign. 


Agenda:

Roger Masterton, a producer/videographer, would like to film a
discussion among cypherpunks about 1st amendment issues, for a PBS
show named "Freedom Speaks."

The show airs nationally on PBS.  In San Francisco, currently on KMPT
Thursdays at 5 p.m., and starting in March, on KQED.

Their web site is http://www.fac.org/ 

There's a lot of 1st amendment issues to talk about these days
regarding the internet, and so the first part of the meeting will
be gathering topics.   There's the first amendment principles
of publishing information in digital form, and the fundamental right
of people to carry on a private conversation.   The discussion will
take whatever organic form it takes, depending on who of us can
make the meeting ...

See you tomorrow if you're coming.  I'll bring bagels again.
