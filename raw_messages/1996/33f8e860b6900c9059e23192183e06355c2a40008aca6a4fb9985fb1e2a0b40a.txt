Transfer of credentials is a big problem in terms of computer based 
authentication.

Authentication is traditionally carried out in one of three forms:

*	Authentication by knowledge(passwords)
*	Authentication by posession(key cards)
*	Authentication by being(biometrics)

With the first two, which are overwhelmingly popular and cheap, the 
transfer of credentials is trivial.

Even if they're not anonymous credentials, the fact that I can hand 
someone my driver's licence to swipe through a card reader next to a 
machine is a simple example of transfer of credentials problem.
