I and a partner are expecting to be online by the 8th of March with a commercial web server (shellback.com).

As part of this presence, I am working on hacking together a program to interface with the SLMail95 (yes, it will be running on a Win95 machine :-) email server to allow operation as a remailer. Initially, I anticipate that it will be a fairly 'dumb' remailer, offering only remailing, reordering, and PGP encryption. Additional CP-style features will be added as my time to implement them permits.

I am offering to maintain an initially limited archives of CP materials and a listserve host (if needed/wanted). I am also actively soliciting (via email to me personally, please, and forgive me if I don't acknowledge it) pointers and materials (files, documents, etc) to include on the site. I have the PGP files from the CP ftp site (before it got 'lost' again), but anything else is *most* welcome.

We will also be offering anonymous email accounts for $5/month.

Following is the PGP key for the remailer we'll be operating (remailer@shellback.com). I want to emphasize that the remailer will *not* keep *any* kind of logs. Bad headers, bounces, or anything else not processed on the first go-through will simply fall into the bitbucket for electron recycling. Since I'll be the postmaster/webmaster, I can say that with no small measure of confidence :-)
