The point here, I think, that we are failing to see is that the 
remailers are run on private machines and bandwidth, when you use a 
remailer you are a guest on someone else property, your mail is using 
their bandwidth etc.
They can determine how they like how they are used, I just hope most 
of us will have the strength of conscience to refrain from using 
remailers which censor or restrict their throughput, I agree that 
spam is a different question but we do have our own way of dealing 
with this, just mailbomb the senders, if they are commercial they are 
likely to leave an address or telephone number on the spam even if 
the email address is anonymized, we have ways ;-) <haha evil nazi 
grin forms on face>
