Ah, you touch on 20+ years of my professional life.  KeyKOS is such a
system as is EROS, a similar system being developed at University of
Pennsylvania.  See:

http://www.cis.upenn.edu:80/~eros/

http://www.agorics.com/agorics/allkey.html - For KeyKOS documentation.

In general these systems provide an execution environment where programs
only have access to the resources they need.  Think of it as a Unix chroot
jail which is specifically designed for each program.  Then add controlled
communication links back to the user's terminal and you get the idea. 
Unless a program has a need to write the system file, it won't have the
privilege, even if it's user does have the privilege.
