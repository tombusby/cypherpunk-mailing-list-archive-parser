	I am not particularly sure why Rich named either me or Jim Bell as
particular recipients of this message. If you're curious as to what my
viewpoint is, I would suggest reading over various CuDigest issues that show
up as having messages from EALLENSMITH or E. Allen Smith on them (the
mbcl.rutgers.edu sometimes fluctuates).

	I would guess Rich is referring to that Declan was actually the second
person to put up a mirror and publicize it; Rich was the first. (I may not be
completely accurate in this; not being one of the participants, I didn't
exactly follow the Rich-Declan discussion on the subject here on cypherpunks
that closely.)
	Interesting book from what I've read of it; I will read farther when
I have time.
	-Allen
