There's a first stab at that Win32 port of ssh that I've been promising
up for FTP at: <URL:ftp://ftp.net.lut.ac.uk/martin/ssh-win32/>

It's not pretty, but it does just about work - though cf. the list of
caveats in the README.  I'll have a go at making this more of a clean
port and less of a quick hack after the New Year :-)

In the meantime, consider this: the Cygnus port of the GNU developers
tools will let you build DLLs.  And it's free, of course...  Should
make building PGP as a DLL a reasonable proposition, methinks -
<URL:http://www.cygnus.com/gnu-win32/> for more info. 

Merry Xmas!
