Ah I see what you're getting at.  My solution (I'm sure I wrote this
somewhere in this thread) was that you'd always have to mount both
file systems during normal usage, otherwise you'd risk damaging the
hidden fs.  You'd only mount the duress fs alone in a duress situation.

Not attractive, but I don't see any easy way around it.

You could be right, I'm not sure how it would go in practice.  But I
don't think there is really much more you can do unless you assume the
ability to conceal a piece of hardware from your opponents.  Say like
a floppy disk with the stego or duress drivers on?  But that gives
rise to all sorts of problems also... where do you store it when
you're not using the computer?  What if they grab you while you're at
the computer?  When you leave the computer for 5 mins?
