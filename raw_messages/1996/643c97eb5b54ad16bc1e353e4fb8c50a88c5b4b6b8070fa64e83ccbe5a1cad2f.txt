Subject: Netscape 3.0b5 can unanonymize Anonymizer

The new netscape has this "feature" where the RHS of KEY=value pairs in tags
can contain inline Javascript, which is evaluated to get the actual RHS.

For example, the HTML:

Did you really think you could be <a href="&{window.open('noanon.html','',
'toolbar=1,location=1,directories=1,status=1,menubar=1,scrollbars=1');
'/'};">anonymous</a>?

will open a new, unanonymized, window (you don't even have to click on the
link).  The main problem is that the Anonymizer doesn't filter out the
new way of embedding Javascript:

&{this.is("javascript code")};

So, if you use the Anonymizer with netscape 3.0b5, _disable_ Javascript
until this is fixed (better yet, disable Javascript and Java entirely,
but that's another story for another time...).
