Terror bombing of civilians was a European not an American invention, though.

The death rate among civilians in many pre civilized wars was as high as
civilian death rates in many of our 20th Century wars.  We have the piles
of bones to prove it.  In addition to peonage, serfdom, chattel slavery and
the treatment of women as chattels, pre civilized people were considerably
more xenophobic than the worst US redneck.  Many had problems accepting the
denizens of the next village a few miles away.  They tended to be racists
as well.  And did I forget to mention infanticide and royalism.
