Look for something along these lines from Congress in the not too distant
future.  All in our best interest, of course.  (from 'In Pursuit of Reason:
The Life of Thomas Jefferson, Nobel E. Cunningham, Jr.)

"The first alien act (June 25, 1798) empowered the president to order the
deportation of any alien he judged "dangerous to the peace and saftey of
the united State" or had reasonable grounds to suspect was involved in any
trasonable intrigue against the government.  It was up to the president to
determine what constituted a danger."

"Even more sweeping and more objectionable to Republican opponents of the
administration was the sedition act (July 14, 1798).  Passed in the final
days of of the session, after Jefferson had left for Virginia, the act made
it unlawful for any person to combine or conspire together to oppose any
lawful measure of the government, to prevent any officer of the united
States from performing his duties, or to aid or attempt to procure 'any
insurrection, roit, unlawful assembly, or combination.' Furthermore, it
provided for the punishment of any person writing, uttering, or publishing
'any false, scandalous and malicious writing' against the president, the
Congress of the government of the united States, made with the intent to
defame them or exite against them 'the hatred of the good people of the
united States.'"
