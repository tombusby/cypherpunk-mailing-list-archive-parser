It is part of the "Trolling Cryptographers Protocol Internet Protocol".  The
"TCP/IP" is a secret government project to keep cryptographers busy by
posting trolls to various newsgroups where they hang out.  (Sometimes they
cross post to various groups using the same technique.  This is known as a
"Troll Bridge".)  It is a followup to the evil and ancient "Asyncronous
Protocols of the Elders of Zion. (Also known as IPv1.) The next upcoming
plot is when they Imminatize the Eschaton with the most evil plot of all...
IPv666!  (Thankfully it only works under Windows 95 so far.)
