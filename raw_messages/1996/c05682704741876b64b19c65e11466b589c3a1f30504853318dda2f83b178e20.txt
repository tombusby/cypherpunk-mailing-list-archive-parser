 I figured it had been sensationalized. I received an email from someone who had  
actually played with such a beast (or claimed to have) and I believe he mentioned  
it had an addin card.

I just did that. Took awhile to find a decent OS/2 email program... I'm not sure

resulted in some messages getting dumped here (still wondering how it managed  
that) cost them a sale.
