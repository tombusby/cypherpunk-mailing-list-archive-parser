Tim, I think you missed his (and my) point.  The purpose of such a split is 
not to disguise the link between Alice and Bob; the point is to prevent 
legal attacks on the remailer by putting the transmission part (Bob) in a 
country which is hard to reach.  Logically, an attacker could easily 
determine that sending a message to Alice would have it come back from Bob, 
but the converse would not be true:  A message which came from Bob would not 
necessarily have come from Alice.  Besides, any legal attack would require a 
substantial investment that would make harassment suits pointless.  Add to 
this the fact that "Bob" might only last a few weeks...

An organization like COS would be faced with no good target.
