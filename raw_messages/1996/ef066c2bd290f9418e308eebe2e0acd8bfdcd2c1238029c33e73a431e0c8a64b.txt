The above mentioned crypto phone was incredibly expensive, if I remember
correctly.  What it basically was (Please keep in mind I may be thinking
of a different product) a box containing a modem and a crypto-crunching
CPU.  Phone in one end, processed by said CPU, and send out other end.  I
have/had a similar idea, but I want to try make it a totally software 
product (assuming you have the necessary hw requirements on your computer)
where you talk in through a microphone (can something be wired so you can
use a regular phone plugged into your computer/modem/soundcard???) your
CPU crunches code, and spits out the encrypted data.  Obviously, the
complementing steps would be done on the receiving end.  
Has anyone ever tried anything like this?

Goals sound good.  I feel it *definately* has to be below $100.  Personally,
I use a phone bought at K-Mart that cost $12 _after_ tax...  I wouldn't 
mind paying $50 for a techno gizmo that made my conversations, inane as they
may be, private.  The price would also have to be low to assure the other
end has a similar techno-gizmo, or I would have wasted my money.  Anyone
else see the *immediate* need for a standard?

>The second goal needs to be to push a similar product for cell-phones. 

If I'm not mistaken (and I've been known to be from time to time :-), cell
phones are already encrypted between the phone and cell tower.  That way,
they are no less private than a regular phone.  Of course, you may be
referring to further end-to-end encryption built into the phone in addition
to this, but as far as they being less secure than a house phone, I'm not
sure about that one.

Agreed!
