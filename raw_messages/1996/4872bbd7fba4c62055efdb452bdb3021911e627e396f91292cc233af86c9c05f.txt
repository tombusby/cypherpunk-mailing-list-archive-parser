Today's Federal Register contains a notice from the Department of State,
Bureau of Political Military Affairs, announcing final rule of an amendment
to the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) allowing U.S. persons
to temporarily export cryptographic products for personal use without the
need for an export license.  The product must not be intended for copying,
demonstration, marketing, sale, re-export, or transfer of ownership or
control.  It must remain in the possession of the exporting person, which
includes being locked in a hotel room or safe.  While in transit, it must be
with the person's accompanying baggage.  Exports to certain countries are
prohibited -- currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and
Syria.  The exporter must maintain records of each temporary export for five
years.  See Federal Register, Vol. 61, No. 33, Friday, February 16, 1996,
Public Notice 2294, pp. 6111-6113.

*The Washington Post* has reported that a Maryland family received a number
of threatening calls after a University of Maryland student used the
Internet to circulate a hearsay allegation that a daughter in the family was
being mistreated by her mother.  Posting his message on Internet newsgroups
concerned with child welfare, psychology, left-wing politics, and civil
liberties, the student urged people to call the mother "at home and tell her
you are disgusted and you demand that she stops."  The student claims: "You
should be able to write what you want on the Internet, whether it's true or
not."  (*Houston Chronicle*, 14 Feb 1996, 2A)
