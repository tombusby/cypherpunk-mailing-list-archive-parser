Despite your silly inferences below, I did not write this note that you are 
responding to.  However, I'd be happy to enter into a $1000 wager with you 
on this.  I'll give permission to any anonymous remailer through which this 
message might have passed (assuming it keeps reverse addresses, many do not) 
to release the original message IF I sent it.  If I did not, you pay me 
$1000.  If I did, I pay you $1000.

Deal?  Somehow I don't think you'll take me up on it.

Question:  How can a judge tell he's being treated with "respect" under the 
conditions described?   Simple answer:  He can't.  What, exactly, would the 
difference between "respect" and "no respect" be?

Proof would be a bit difficult under the circumstances.  However, I am sure 
that you consider minor issues such as proof to be of no consequence.
