I've noticed that many places are concerned more with things like creativity,
adapability, drive, etc when hiring a CS grad.  I've found that having a
resume that shows these kind of traits well overcame the lack of a degree
(I'm working on that). There was a thread about this in comp.lang.cobol
awhile back.

The old way was that your HS provided what the mythical average person needed
to go about life. College was for the more "complex" careers.

You don't even need to be that harsh.  Chain-gang work to pay off stolen
property would be more effective, if for no reason other than that you'd get
your money (or property) back.

And you have to look at it from another point of view:   If it would
ameliorate the problems in the future for the majority of the population,
it'd be worth a bit of discomfort now.
