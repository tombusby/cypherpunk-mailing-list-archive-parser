The real problem you are having is that the political 'spectrum' is not 1 
dimensional (a line). If you describe it in 2 dimensions, it makes a lot 
more sense. The libertarians have a diagram they call the worlds smallest 
political quiz that describes it fairly well. It can be found at 
http://www.libertarian.com/wwlp/docs/awspq.html?quiz

I first saw mention of a chart similar to this in the 60s. It was a way of 
describing beliefs politically that was put forth by Jerry Pournelle. (Who 
is available on the net btw.)

Yup. You hit the nail on the head here. This is something that any thinking 
person should recognise. The basic way we are taught to understand and 
reference politics =makes=no=sense=.

Take a gander at the libertarian's chart. I think it is a more accurqte way 
of describing people, and in fact is similar in some ways to what you 
describe. A philosophy is charted based on how one views personal and 
property rights.
