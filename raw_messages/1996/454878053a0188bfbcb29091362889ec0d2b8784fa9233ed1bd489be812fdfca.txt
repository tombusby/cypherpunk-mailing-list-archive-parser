SCOOPS AND TOP STORIES

THE LEGISLATION THAT LAUNCHED THOUSANDS OF CYBERSPACE RIBBONS
It's baaaack... The Supreme Court will decide tomorrow whether it should
review the CDA--the legislation cyberspace loves to hate--or simply put it
out to pasture. Swirling around inside this legal vortex are issues of free
speech, the definition of "obscene," and a potential $250,000 fine for
transgressors. Maybe CDA really stands for "Can't download anything..."

THE NOSTRADAMUS OF THE SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET SPEAKETH!
Who better than a Robertson, Stephens semiconductor analyst to take you on a
guided tour of the volatile world of semiconductor stocks? Dan Niles
demystifies the market's plummeting and rising...distinguishes between
trends and blips, and pontificates on where semiconductor stocks are going
in the long run. [Hint: Can you say $275 billion?...]

MIGHT THAT BE THE VIROGEN.ASEXUAL VIRUS IN YOUR SOFTWARE?
Downloaders of PointCast's version 1.2 got a bit of a shock for their
trouble, namely a Norton antivirus software-generated message that told them
they had contracted a virus with the esoteric moniker "Virogen.asexual."
While the scare isn't in league with the benzene-in-the-Perrier snafu of a
few years back, there were still ruffled feathers that needed smoothing.
