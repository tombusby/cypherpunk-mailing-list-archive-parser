Subject: What constitutes a remailer?

What really constitutes a remailer (pseudo-anonymous vs anonymous 
arguments aside)?  For example, the other day I received a message from 
66west.com saying that I had a greeting card waiting, I was to go to a 
certain URL and enter a simple password to retreive my "greeting card".  
Now this card had no return address, no name.  Could this constitute a 
remailer?  A while back there was a thread on how to take some of the 
responsibility off of the remailer operators (the last one in the chain 
more so), could this be a viable alternative?  (Actually, I believe it 
was discussed).  As for tracking, I'm sure the server logs are rotated 
often, and are not kept forever (our student page server here rotates 
daily and logs are kept for 4 days AFAIK), so perhaps this may even be 
less traceable.  Using these greeting cards, what prohibits me from 
sending a letter instead of "happy birthday"?

Will the anti-remailer people crack down on this also?  I can just see 
the law "Thou shalt not send greeting cards via email without photoID" 
:-)
