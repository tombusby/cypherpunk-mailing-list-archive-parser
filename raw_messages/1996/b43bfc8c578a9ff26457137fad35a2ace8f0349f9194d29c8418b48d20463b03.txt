Although using other networks probably isn't as safe as using your own LAN,
.....
If you send the packets across the US then there are more variables to
determine time they took to get back. This is obviously becuase each
and every machine in between well vary in speed, line connections etc...
And the timing even on the same machine well change, because of CPU laod
etc..

Maybe another "random" source XORed with this?
I don't know, just a though.
