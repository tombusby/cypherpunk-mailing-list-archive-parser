Swearest thou, ungracious boy? Henceforth, ne'er look upon me. There is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old, fat man. A tun of man is thy companion. Wherein is he neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon and to eat it? Wherein is he cunning, but in craft? Wherein is he crafty, but in villainy? Wherein is he villainous, but in all things? Wherein is he worthy, but in nothing?
