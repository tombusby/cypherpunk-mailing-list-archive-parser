I don't think I am following you. My messages are a constant size signal (I
send N messages through the remailer). More traffic increases the
background signal and background noise. While the signal to noise of the
background gets better, the actual amount of noise went up so the ratio of
MY signal to the background noise went down. Perhaps I don't understand
what you are saying.

I think multiple remailers on a machine are less effective than a single
remailer with the combined traffic of all the individual remailers, because
the combined remailer does better reordering from a larger pool.

If the remailer chain contains just two or more uncompromised hops (not
necessarily consecutive) I suspect an attacker will be forced to treat the
remailer bramble as a single object. This attack is based on time
correlations of messages sent and received. In this case background traffic
is good because of the large number of false correlations it generates.
However, it is stunning how few messages it takes to make the correlation
stand out. The defense against this attack is to ensure that you send and
receive enough remailer mail to correlate with all other users for all
messages. Producing cover traffic, some of which returns to you, and some
of which is bit bucketed also ensures that it will not be known when you
receive a real message (as opposed to one of your own). Obviously this is
best done when you are a remailer operator yourself.
