  You'd have to make sure everything was soldered in pretty well, but it
could be done. As for solar flare, etc. protection it won't need anything
that any other satellite system would need.

  Embarrasingly enough, I cannot remember its name. I don't have a HAM
license (although I've studied for it -- just never took the test), but my
boss does. I think the satellite was launched in the mid to late 80's, and
it used for experimental communications.

  Good idea, I'll start a link on my webpage :>

  We'd want someone more reliable than ESA! I doubt that we could afford
to have a backup satellite in case of a disaster. Once the Delta Clipper
is functional the payload costs to orbit is supposed to drop tremendously.
