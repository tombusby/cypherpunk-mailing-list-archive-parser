Listen motherfucker.
I`m going to say this once and for all... this list is not about 
hacking, not about "me too" messages, it is about cryptography, the 
tecnical and ethical sides. if you want to post shit like this do it 
on alt.2600 and let me tell you they will flame you for it there too, 
and quite rightly, I think I speak for us all when I say RTFM.
