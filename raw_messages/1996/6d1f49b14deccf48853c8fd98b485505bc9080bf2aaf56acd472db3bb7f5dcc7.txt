>4. The OTP arrives on the other end, completely safe from snooping.
>
>Now you see the problem.  #4 above can't be assured, and that is why Ed says

>I'm not sure what you're claiming here, or what point it is intended to

>would render it no longer a OTP.  Besides, this scenario makes no sense.  In

>even One Time Pads) to whomever you choose, by whatever means.  (Granted, if
