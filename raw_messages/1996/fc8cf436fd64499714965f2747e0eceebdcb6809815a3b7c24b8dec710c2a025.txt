This is a load of hooey.  I don't know How Mr. Bell thinks the law works 
in the United States, but I do know it has so little basis in reality as 
to be laughable.

I'm sure Mr. Bell will ask me now to cite three cases which indicate that 
lending a chainsaw to someone without asking for ID is negligant.

I would laugh out loud if I didn't think some people were taking Mr. Bell 
seriously.

Delivery is another matter, but the judge that affirms the seizure of a 
house on the basis of a single delivery to a guest in the residence will 
be politely asked to leave the bench.  Unless the guest has some 
ownership of the house....

But did we expect Mr. Bell to actually be correct at this point?

Mr. Bell, I suggest you take a correspondence course.  Perhaps the one on 
T.V. with Sally Struthers.  I believe they offer "Legal Secretary" as an 
option.  You would about double your practical knowledge of the law in 
this fashion.

I STRONGLY suggest that readers afford Mr. Bell's writings and 
conclusions a healthy degree of skepticism.
