  Another problem is that the government may consider any "help" provided
to the foreign entity to be evidence of a conspiracy.  When Eric Young
released SSLEAY we got a call from someone in the State Department
(probably some lackey paid for by the NSA) to find out if we provided
him with any "help" in doing his implementation.  Since he did it all
on his own from the published spec and was able to test interoperability
over the internet we were off the hook, but they seemed to be prepared
to come down on us if we had "conspired" with him.
