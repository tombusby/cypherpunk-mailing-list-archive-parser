Since this Java error is probably deep in the bytecode interpreter,
the question is will Sun patch this *particular* problem, still allowing
others, or will it have to rewrite the interpreter so that it enforces
the language more rigorously?  They are under pressure to make a
"quick fix" (they've promised something in two days), but real
security needs to be built in to a system from the ground up,
with disciplline and thorough design.  If they need to redesign their
approach to implementing the bytecode interpreter, that could take
weeks, months?

BTW, its a testament to security through code review, as the Princeton
team probably could not have discovered this deep flaw without looking
through the code.
