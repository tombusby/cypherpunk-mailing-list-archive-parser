  I just looked at c2's certificate, and it doesn't expire until april.
The only reason I can think of that you should have a problem is if the
date on your machine is wrong.

  We do not send the HTTP 'From:' header.  I will look into where
they are getting the user name and location from.  There is really
nothing I can do in the Navigator to stop them from getting your
IP address or DNS name.

  If you are operating a server you can use a certificate signed by any
CA you want.  When someone running Navigator 2.0 connects to that site
they will be presented with a sequence of dialogs that allow them to
decide if they want to talk to your site.  

  Adding new certificates (other than for remote SSL servers) will generally
be done via CA web pages, not the preferences UI.
