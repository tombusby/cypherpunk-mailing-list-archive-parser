Yes, it produces a "kind" of pseudo random number...the problem is
determining which "kind" it is and whether it is sufficient for the planned
use. The Netscape RNG also produced a "kind" of pseudo random number
generator...but it was insufficient, as events showed.

If by "simulation" you mean "prediction," I agree. I agree that predicting
the next bit in a sequence might be hard. (But "hard" is a slippery term,
and the history of crypto is littered with the corpses of systems that
seemed to be hard but weren't.)

However, even predicting the next bit with 50.0001% accuracy might be
sufficient to reduce the work factor in an attack by many orders of
magnitude.

And some attacks might rely on the overall statistics of the bits, not just
the ability to predict the nth bit.

Again, there's a huge literature on this.
