Hi all,

Just announcing my cryptography www site, it`s very new so the 
content isn`t all there yet but it`s worth a look, email me and tell 
me what you think, also if anyone has any research papers on 
cryptography in ASCII, doc etc.. formats could they email them to me 
for putting on the pages...
