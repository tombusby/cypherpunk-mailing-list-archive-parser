According to a friend who started a company that is going to sell gambling
machines to Las Vegas:

The Nevada Gaming Commission closley regulates the RNGs.  They use Chi
squared tests and others to verify the randomness.  They are not perfect.

Todays slot machines use a Psudo RNG that requires a seed number to make
sure it doesn't short cycle.  They use some time based player input like
coin in or handle pulls to pick a number.  You must discard lots of numbers
or it would be too easy to sync up and predict the answer. (basically
confirming the above)

Nothing is totally immune to tampering.  The gaming commission tries to
make sure the machines are reasonable secure.
