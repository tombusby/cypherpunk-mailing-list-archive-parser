Jim: I've worked on a presidential campaign before and can tell you that
if the FEC is likely to consider something a violation, the campaign is
not going to skirt the line.

That said, perhaps the law is outdated and needs to be changed. The
portion of the campaign finance law, as intepreted by the FEC, barring
online services from providing free accounts to political candidates, is
now being scrutinized in Congress. Rep. White will introduce a reform
bill in about two weeks.
