Have we had an influx of fuzzy-thinking liberals lately?  Not that this is a
bad thing, it is hard to argue with people who agree with you on everything :-)

The ability to spell helps to gaurentee success as well.  Seriously, you
ignore the correlation between performance in college and standardized test
scores.  There is a reason these are used in admissions - they are actually
pretty good predictors of the ability to perform college level work.

Oh, I forgot.  Only certain racial/ethnic groups are capable of
understanding basic mathematical concepts.  Of course, caucasians are one of
these groups (since they consistently are outperformed by immigrants from
other countries).  

I know it makes you feel good to believe that all that is wrong is caused by
conspiracies led by the EVIL RICH in this country.  I happen to feel better
believing in the potential for any individual in this country to succeed
through hard work.
