  The release of Netscape Navigator that just started early beta, marketing
named "Atlas", has support for client certificates.  A spec detailing
how to interoperate with it, similar to the one I wrote on SSL 2 server
certificates, should be available before the final release of the product.

  The statement that "Netscape caches passwords" is not in itself true.
It is true that if the no-cache header is not present, AND the site
is using forms to enter passwords rather than HTTP auth, then the
form post data(including password) will be cached.  I've said here
before that this bug is being fixed in the next beta of the
upcoming release.  The default for SSL pages will be not to cache
at all.  If they used HTTP auth, their passwords would not
have gone into the cache.

  No, Java does not have access to the cache, or any other file.
