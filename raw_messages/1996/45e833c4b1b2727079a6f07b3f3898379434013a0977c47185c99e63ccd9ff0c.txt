This is an unusual development, asking for "two forms of ID." If I attend,
can I use the "May Company" ID card I had printed up, or are only State of
California and El Cajon Public Library cards accepted?

We've had several key-signings in the Bay Area, and at none of the ones
I've seen has there been any demand for "two forms of ID." In fact, I
understand that some of the keys signed were for people whose nom de list
differs from what Sacramento knows them by. Lucky Green might want to
comment.

This gets back to the familiar issue of what it is a name credential really
means, and whether we care.

--Tim May, the name I use for this list
