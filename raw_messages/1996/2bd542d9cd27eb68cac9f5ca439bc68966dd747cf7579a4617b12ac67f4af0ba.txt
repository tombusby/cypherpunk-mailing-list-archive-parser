I think a few of this sig quotes I've seen float through here would be
apprapo.  It has the be short and concise, and be easily understood by both
side of the issue.  Insulting or alienating the do-gooders with a quote
that could follow us around for awhile would not be in our best interest.
Some good ones I've collected are:

"Those that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary
 safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."
-- Benjamin Franklin (1773)

"It is not the function of our Government to keep the citizen from falling
into error; it is the function of the citizen to keep the Government from
falling into error."
Robert H. Jackson (1892-1954), U.S. Judge


"To sin by silence instead of protest makes cowards out of men."
-- Abraham Lincoln

"It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once."
                                                       -Hume

Let's hear some more.

On the meridian of time there is no injustice, only the poetry of motion
creating the illusion of truth and drama.
