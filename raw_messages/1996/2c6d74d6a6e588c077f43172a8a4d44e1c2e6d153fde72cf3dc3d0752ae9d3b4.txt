Clear and present danger to possibly unknowing persons lives. People have a
right to know if their sex partners have communicable diseases. In the case
of a 'Typhoid Mary' type disease then everyone has a right to know that
person is infected.

Clear and present danger. Once a well is contaminated that contamination can
spread through the whole local water table and infect hundreds if not
thousands of people with disease without warning.

As long as they have a license to operate a food dispencing facility (in
other words they are certifying they are aware of the correct processes for
such operations) then nobody should have the right to interfere with their
operation unless with probable cause (ie proof of danger such as bad weenies
in their hot dogs). This would not apply to individuals or families making
such food in the same place for their own and NOT public consumption.

A person or group has a right to swing their fists all they want, just not
in my face. This also applies to the government which is nothing more than
our elected representatives. We also can not give them rights we ourselves
don't posses.
