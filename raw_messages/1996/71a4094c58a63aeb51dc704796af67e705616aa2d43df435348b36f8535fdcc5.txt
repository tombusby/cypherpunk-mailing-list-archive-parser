As far as the government is concerned, "gonna do this" and "may have 
to do this" is the same, since the "this" is illegal.  There is no 
dividing line. I suspect that since they (alegedly) had specific targets
planned it leaned closer to the "gonna do this".  From the minimal 
discussion in the media I have read, it appeared to be another 
'revenge for waco and ruby ridge' action rather than a 'defense of 
civil liberties from a potential totalitarian government' action.
 (I'm rather skeptical as to how blowing up a specific IRS office would
be effective were the government to change into a totalitarian regime.)
