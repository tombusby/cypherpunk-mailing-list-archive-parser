I thought this excerpt taken from comp.risks would be interesting here...
I snarfed it off a webpage where the user thought the comments about
insecure keys was interesting.... I find the anon-remailer comments the
most interesting...

I attended last week's ``Information, National Policies, and International
Infrastructure" Symposium at Harvard Law School, organized by the Global
Information Infrastructure Commission, the Kennedy School, and the Institute
for Information Technology Law & Policy of Harvard Law School.

During the presentation by Paul Strassmann, National Defense University, and
William Marlow, Science Applications International Corporation, entitled
``Anonymous Remailers as Risk-Free International Infoterrorists'', the
question was raised from the audience (Professor Charles Nesson, Harvard Law
School) -- in a rather extended debate -- whether the CIA and similar
government agencies are involved in running anonymous remailers, as this
would be a perfect target to scan possibly illegal messages.

Both presenters explicitly acknowledged that a number of anonymous remailers
in the US are run by government agencies scanning traffic.  Marlow said that
the government runs at least a dozen remailers and that the most popular
remailers in France and Germany are run by the respective government
agencies in these countries.  In addition, they mentioned that the NSA has
successfully developed systems to break encrypted messages will less than
1000-bit [public] keys and strongly suggested using at least 1024-bit keys.
They said that they themselves use 1024-bit keys.

I ask Marlow afterwards if these comments were off or on record, he paused
then said that he can be quoted.

So I thought I pass that on. It seems interesting enough, don't you think?
