Nope; It's the truth. Expressed like a sarcastic joke as well, but

But: How many times do I have to state explicitly that my grumbles about
America are not "anti-American" (troll) propaganda? Nope; They're grumbles
about _freedoms_, that if you Americans lose, the rest of the world will
_also_ lose, (even quicker, I think)... Here is a REAL example:



(written by E. Francis, on the "Trilateral Commission", and distributed
