Basically, the only reason your ISP's machines would appear in your
sendmail.cf is because you are using them for mail forwarding. When I was
connected over PPP (24 hours) I had my Linux box send the mail directly. If
you just want to avoid your ISP's logs, then replace their mail server with
some other server in your sendmail.cf. You should ask the owner of the
server you want to use.

If you use popmail (like Eudora), then just tell it the server to use in
"SMTP Host".
