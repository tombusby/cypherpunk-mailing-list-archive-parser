I initially tried filtering out anything _from_ JB; still got overloaded by
people trying to talk some sense into him (at the time, it was Black Unicorn
arguing law with him). Finally had to simply tell Eudora that anything from
him, or including his name (contains:) goes straight to the trash. That
finally did the trick. Interestingly, he's the only one I trash, sight
unseen.....
