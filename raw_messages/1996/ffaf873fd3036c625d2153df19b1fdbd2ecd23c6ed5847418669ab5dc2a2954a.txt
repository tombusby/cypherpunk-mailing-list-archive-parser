Particularly in cases where, rightly or wrongly, the folks being subjected
to ad hominem have a very favorable public image.

Explanations that give credit for good intentions and show how the present
action works to undermine them, and which include constructive alternatives,
are a _lot_ more likely to be listened to.

At least that's the way it works for me. And it works for pretty much
everyone I know. If there's anyone here who's more impressed by ad hominem,
I'd be curious, but they'd still be in the minority.
