The judge is correct in this matter, most people view it from the 
rights of the parents, but what about the child who, because of 
his/her parents egotism and ignorance, grows up not being able to 
compete effectivly?

My rights, even parental rights, end when their exersize directly 
impact someone else(the child) in a negative way.
