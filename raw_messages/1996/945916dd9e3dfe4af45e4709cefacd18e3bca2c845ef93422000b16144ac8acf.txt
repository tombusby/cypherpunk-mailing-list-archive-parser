One of our former mayors in my town, was brought to trial for this. He 
had allegedly paid off a police officer and/or the airport to let the plane 
land. From what I have heard it was pretty cut and dry that he did it. But 
all he had to do was get a lawyer that caught the government prosecution 
with their pants down and he's running for city council this year. Its a 
shame. I haven't heard the DEA mentioned by anybody.
