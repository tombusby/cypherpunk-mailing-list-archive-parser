Actually, I was comparing some people on the list, who were saying someone
could always start thier own list, with those who advocate telling someone
to start a new country as opposed to making their vote count.  This is a
free country where we, fortunately, don't have to hang around, and, this is
a free list, where we don't have to post or remain subscribers.  I was
saying that telling someone to start their own list was equivalent to
telling them to dig in on an uninhabited island.  I was never advocating
either action.  If you read the previous posts, you can see the one I
responded to and see what I mean.  I know that this may not be possible as
you probably tossed them, but ask me if you would like, I have that post
somewhere in backup.
