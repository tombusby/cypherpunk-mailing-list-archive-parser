Huh? And why are we so grumpy today?

Not necessarily: as an example of legacy work, consider the
conversion of Cobol to 4GL. When you have a working program to
emulate, you can do that without too much customer contact. It's
in new software (where maybe the customer is herself not clear
what she actually needs) that close contact is essential. 

Take another example: you have some old software, and you need to
add a bell or whistle. Sure, you may need to run the modified
software on site for testing, but often that too can be done from
a remote terminal. And even if you do have to travel for the
purpose, it still works out cheaper, since manpower costs are low
in the 3rd world.

Um, maybe you misread: why would an American company pay to have
software written, that only runs on obsolete machines? Now,
converting that software to run on a modern machine, that's
altogether different -- you have to be able to read Cobol or
Autocoder or whatever, but what you actually write would be based
on modern tools.

A sensible business decision: long-distance security is hard to
achieve. But I doubt that it has anything to do with the power
that the Indian government has (or hasn't) over Informix?

Are you suggesting that Indian programmers come to work with like
a chain gang, with armed government guard? You really must talk
to some programmers from India, ask them if the government
commands them this way, but do have some oxygen handy, or they
might die laughing...

Look, governments in the 3rd world are often stupid and corrupt
-- no doubt that contributes to poverty, but that isn't the only
reason. I'm sure one of the reasons is cultural: modern
industrial societies require a high degree of training,
discipline, whatever. Western societies needed centuries of
misery to learn these, we're trying to do it faster, and
hopefully be a bit more humane in the process.

Other that Coke and IBM, which we already discussed, can you name
one other? In the last years, lots of companies have opened shop
here, including Coke and IBM.

And even these two didn't flee: a new law was passed, they didn't
want to comply, so they left or were asked to leave. In the case
of Coke, I can understand the government not wanting to spend
precious foreign exchange on sugared water in a country where
there is a serious shortage of drinking water. Tim made the
perfectly valid point that such decisions cost the country in
reputation, but the Indian government doesn't mind loss of
reputation in matters it firmly believes in, as in the current CTBT discussion.
