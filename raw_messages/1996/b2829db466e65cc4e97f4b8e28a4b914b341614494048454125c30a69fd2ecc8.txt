When Senator Leahy's first crypto bill was proposed early this year, at 
first glance it appeared to help our cause. Many people around here at least 
gave it lukewarm support.  However, it contained a section making  (quote 
approximate) "use of encryption to thwart an investigation" a crime.  I 
pointed out, quite loudly, that any encrypting anonymous remailer could be 
considered practically automatically guilty of this.  In fact, the feds 
could simply start a sham "investigation," perhaps assisted by a phony 
message sent by a confederate through the remailer, and then declare that 
their investigation had been "thwarted."

Whether such an interpretation would fly was, obviously, a question, but by 
the time the SC had issued its ruling the remailer's hardware would have 
been siezed collecting dust in some Fed warehouse for 2-3 years.
