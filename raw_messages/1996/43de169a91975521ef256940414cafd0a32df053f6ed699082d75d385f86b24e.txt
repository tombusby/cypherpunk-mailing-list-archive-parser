These things do not need to be verified at the source level.  One could
verify the output of the compiler and then publish a secure hash of it. 
(What an tedious job.)  There is infinite regress in these things, but I
would tend to trust a program which verified the secure hash of the crypto
system if that program was written after I received the release of the
compiler I am compiling it with.
