I wish there were a hard-and-fast rule that this were true.  I work in
Point Of Sale (POS or cash registers), and occasionally we will see a vendor
whose software stores money/currency in floating point data types.  I try
very hard to make sure we do not purchase their software, because this
implies the most gross lack of understanding imaginable.

Floating points are simply not accurate when you're performing math on
other people's money.

And, yes, rates are acceptable to store and use as floats, but even the
conversion process ultimately yields a long, not a float.  And, we usually go
out of our way to code rates up as integers and perform the decimal point
shifting in code.

In the currency class we use, we have an exponent property that defines where
the decimal point is.  I imagine that by converting the exponent from a short
to a long we could even handle lira!  :-)  *
