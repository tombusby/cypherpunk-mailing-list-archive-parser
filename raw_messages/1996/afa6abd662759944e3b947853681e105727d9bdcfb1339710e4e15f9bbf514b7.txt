Undoubtedly.

Interestingly (to me, anyway), I noticed on my last trip to Hong Kong
that the Netscape products for sale in the legitimate shops had "US/Canada
only - not for export" (or similar) printed on the packaging. 

(Also of note, the hot Pirate CD of that time "Internet Xpress", with
such goodies as Symantec Java Cafe,  Spry Internet Office Pro, Netscape
Fast Track Server v2.0, Commerce Builder v1.5, also featured ViaCrypt
PGP v2.71 for Windows. Nice to see encryption as a must have net tool...)
