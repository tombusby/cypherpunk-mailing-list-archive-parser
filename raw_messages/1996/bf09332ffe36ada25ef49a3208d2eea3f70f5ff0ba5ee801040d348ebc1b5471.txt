So do brain-dead journalists and "security experts".  Oops, take that back, no 
probability involved, they are nasty problems.

:Was that a remailer or simply forged mail?

How long have people been bitching about putting digital signatures on stuff 
like that.  If it was signed, it could of been verified if indeed it was legit

Irregardless of where it came from, anybody stupid enough to believe everything 
they read, without checking out it's validity, deserves what they get.

What?? like anonymous electronic media spreads the disease somehow.  To the 
person who wrote the article, you have proved beond a shadow of a doubt that 
you are dense as a brick.  Wrong type of virus, you mean the other kind.
