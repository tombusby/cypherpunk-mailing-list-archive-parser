Getting closer:

#1 says to the rest:  "We're going to have a sequential vote, #1 to #20.  
The first 10 who vote "yes" to this proposal get to share in the loot, 
equally."

#1 must vote in favor, obviously.  The second can "guarantee" himself a part 
of the pot, if it's given out in this first round, by voting "yes."  The 
#2 is only motivated to vote "no" if he thinks he can get a better deal 
on subsequent iterations, and it's conceivable there won't BE more 
iterations if at least 9 people after him vote "yes" and he's voted no.  
Also, if this first proposal is rejected, the #2 wouldn't be in an 
appreciably better position than #1 was.  So #2 will vote yes, as well.

This procedure will repeat.  As more people vote "yes," the danger in 
defecting (voting "no") will increase, because it will be effectively 
certain that  someone else will collect that reward.  As long as there are 
more people left to vote than would be necessary to increase the vote total 
to 10, nobody can afford to vote "no."

So the proposal will pass, and the first 10 intelligent people will win.
