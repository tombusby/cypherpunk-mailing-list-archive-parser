        Now _that's_ a useful and on-target observation.

	Quite. To expand it: A. a program doesn't have to be new to the
technical community to make a difference, it just has to be new to the rest of
the world; B. publicity for programs makes a difference. If DigiCash had
come out with this program and had done the press release better than the FV
folks, I suspect we'd be cheering them on and the credit card types would be
doing worse - a good situation.
