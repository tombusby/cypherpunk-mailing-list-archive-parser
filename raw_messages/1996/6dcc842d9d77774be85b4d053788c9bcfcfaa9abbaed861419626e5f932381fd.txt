Is this a troll?

People lose important papers all the time, such as by losing their wallets
or having their purses stolen, their homes burglarized, etc.

States will issue replacement driver's licenses easily. (Before Mr.
Anonymous asks, "But how will they know you are you?," remember that they
have one's photo, one's signature, and (increasingly) a fingerprint.

Ditto for passports, which are also routinely replaced.

And does the phrase "Call this number if your card is lost or stolen"
suggest something about replacement of credit cards?

I guess this was just a troll, or the post of a high school student
answering his Internet homework question.
