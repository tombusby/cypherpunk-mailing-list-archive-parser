(1) SENATOR BURNS ANNOUNCES BILL TO LIFT CRYPTO EXPORT CONTROLS

The battle to roll back the Clinton Administration's encryption policy
escalated on Thursday when Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) announced that he
will introduce a new proposal to repeal restrictions on encryption exports
and to encourage the growth of electronic commerce. Senator Burns announced
the bill via a teleconference during a special session at the Computers,
Freedom, and Privacy Conference in Boston, MA.

The bill, titled the "Promoting Commerce On-Line in the Digital Age Act"
(PROCODE), joins two recent bills introduced earlier this month (S. 1587
and HR 3011) designed to encourage the development of strong, easy-to-use
privacy and security products for the Internet.

The Burns bill is different from the other proposals in several respects.
Specifically, the latest bill does not contain any new criminal provisions
or provisions imposing liability on third party key holders.

In his presentation today at CFP, Sen. Burns outlined his new bill. Among
other things, the "Promoting Commerce On-Line in the Digital Age Act"
would:

* Allow for the unrestricted export of "mass-market" or "public-domain"
  encryption programs, including such products as Pretty Good Privacy
  and popular World Wide Web software. Encryption software and hardware
  for sale in local software stores or widely available on the Internet
  would all be exportable under the proposed Act.

* Require the Secretary of Commerce to allow the unrestricted export of
  other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are
  generally available outside the United States.

* Prohibit the Federal Government from imposing mandatory key-escrow
  encryption policies on the domestic market.

* Limit the authority of the Secretary of Commerce to set standards for
  encryption products.

CDT applauds this effort by Senator Burns to put strong privacy and
security technologies in the hands of individuals and businesses. CDT is
also pleased that the Senator chose the Computers, Freedom, and Privacy
Conference as a forum to announce this proposal. The choice of CFP
demonstrates that the Internet community is becoming an increasingly
important political constituency.

CDT looks forward to working with Senator Burns and other members of
Congress interested in policies which encourage the development and
widespread use of strong privacy protecting technologies for the Global
Information Infrastructure.
