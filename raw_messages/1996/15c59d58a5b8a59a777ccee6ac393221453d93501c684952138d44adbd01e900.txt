INSECURITY FEARS
A North American study on Internet security by Ernst & Young says that
companies fear doing business via the Internet.  Companies with a direct
Internet connection are concerned that outsiders can gain access to their
systems and data bases, and companies that transmit sensitive financial
information worry about the security of these transactions.   (Toronto Globe
& Mail 25 Jan 96 B5)

	If they're actually seriously becoming paranoid about this, it's an
opportunity to press cryptography. Anyone seen the original study?

>TELECOM "GIVEAWAY" CONTROVERSY MAY BE DEFERRED
Senate Commerce Committee chair Larry Pressler (R., SD) is suggesting that a
controversial provision of the telecommunications legislation be removed
from that legislation and addressed in a separate bill.  The provision has
been attacked by Senator Bob Dole and other Republicans as a "giveaway" of
valuable airwaive spectrum to TV broadcasters for uses such as
high-definition television.  (New York Times 25 Jan 96 C6)

	Looks like another anti-"CDA" campaign may soon be neccessary.
