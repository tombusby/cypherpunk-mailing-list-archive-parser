>LUCENT'S NET SOFTWARE MAKES INTERNET PHONE CALLS EASY
>New software developed by Lucent Technologies is designed to give Internet
>callers quicker access to one another and allows them to converse via their
>computers as if they were on a regular speaker-phone.  Previous software has
>been half-duplex -- one party must stop speaking before the other can
>"capture" the line.  Lucent plans to market the software to AT&T, the Bell
>companies and Internet service providers for distribution to their
>customers.  By the end of the year, Lucent plans to enhance the software so
>that users can videoconference over the Internet.  (Wall Street Journal 18

I'd wonder if a patch can be built to encrypt each packet as it goes out? I'm
guessing that what they've done is improve the voice compression, so there will
be a relatively small amount of data to encrypt.

>PROGRAMMABLE COMPUTER CHIPS
>Next month, Metalithic Systems Inc. will release a $1500 sound board called
>Digital Wings that uses field-programmable gate array computer chips that
>can be personalized, allowing the user to create and edit up to 128
>soundtracks.  When used in combination with Windows 95, Digital Wings will
>give users access to audio synthesis and editing tools comparable to those
>of a professional sound studio.  (Business Week 23 Sep 96 p86)

	I wonder exactly how reprogrammable this system is...
