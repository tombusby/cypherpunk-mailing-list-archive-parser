Actually, this kind of stunt fully justifies whatever level of lethal 
punishment  that the public will one day direct at these thugs.  Look at 
what you just said, paraphrased by me:

"Man wins $27,000.  He will eventually be required to report and pay taxes 
on the amount, but not quite yet.  Stupid I/R/S people alert him BEFORE he 
files his taxes.  He reports the payment, as is ostensibly legally required. 
 He paid the taxes owed.  Period."

THEN you said, "we settled the matter."   Huh?  What, exactly, was there to 
"settle"?  Remember, you just said that the stupid I/R/S agents ALERTED him, 
right?  Well, if they do stupid things they ought to be punished for them, 
right?!?  One of the consequences of showing your hand early is that any 
potential opponent can adjust his behavior to AVOID getting caught doing 
something wrong.  Since this man's obligations were in the future, he was 
alerted to fulfill them.

(this is quite analogous to cops driving around in marked cars.  Presumably, 
they will occasionally be seen by a person planning a crime, who may be 
deterred from his intent temporarily or permanently.)

Don't try to claim that the act of receiving the money in portions evidenced 
intent to commit a crime, because reporting and paying the taxes made that 
possibility moot.  At best, you might claim that had he COULD HAVE carried 
it through to illegality, analogous to the possibility that if a person 
picks up an object in a store, he MIGHT head for the exit without paying, or 
go to the cash register to pay.  Store detectives, wisely, know that they 
must wait for a shoplifter to leave the store BEFORE closing in.

I say again:  It is  PRECISELY this kind of outrageous behavior that results 
in revolutions, assassinations, and other incidents.  The hostage-taking 
currently going on in Peru has captured Peruvian government officials who 
heretofore, felt safe abusing THEIR citizenry the same way you once felt 
safe abusing yours. Tell me, would you have felt abused if during your 
previous employment you'd been taken hostage similarly?
