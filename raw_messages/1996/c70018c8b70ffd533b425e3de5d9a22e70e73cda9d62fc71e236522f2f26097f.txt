Sorry to say, but I did not get english classes up until grade 4 and
since I had no occasions to practice it before age 18, I don't
remember anything of my english classes.  A major brain trauma
probably helped too.  Although I write french much better than most of
the university educated francophone population here, I don't even
remember any french grammar.

As for the word 'predicate', would you please deign tell me what it
means?  I don't have an english dictionnary handy.

As for my true question regarding realdeal.exe /per used on top of
SecureDrive 1.4a, do you have any comments?
