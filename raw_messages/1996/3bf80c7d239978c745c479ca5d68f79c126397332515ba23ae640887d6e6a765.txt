	That they mentioned this is perhaps an indication that they aren't
exactly on the side of anyone except pro-censorship parents.

	I'd call both a problem, when you're using a system that is meant for
censorship purposes as opposed to finding-stuff purposes. If it's a system for
finding stuff, then the content provider should be involved; it will vary
whether the ISP should be involved (that can be left up to the individual ISP).

	They try to emphasize individual - or actually, parental - decision,
but they seem to have entirely forgotten about the use of this system by
governmental censors. It can be used for such either for preemptive censorship
(a Chinese firewall) or for spotting people to arrest when you start up
censorship. If the government gets involved in doing a rating system, then
it can better start doing things like mandating that particular material be
rated or you're up on "corrupting a minor". The recent CDA decision (thank you,
all plaintiffs, lawyers, judges, and God) does emphasize that mandatory rating
isn't constitutional... but A. the Supreme Court may not be as sensible (God
forbid) and B. other countries may have other ideas.
