Seems to me there's a difference between "the only time messages are 
read" and "the only time messages are *supposed* to be read".  Since 
Bert says the former, you have to wonder...   And as far as "regular 
monitoring for compliance" goes, does the Post Office monitor first 
class mail now ("regular monitoring")?  Do they have a monitoring law 
besides the ability to open letters with a warrant?

I hate to be rude Bert, but for the zillionth time, what you oppose is 
entire irrelevant to this subject, unless you are *the* decision maker 
in designing binding crypto products and making attendant regulations.

Well, Bert, who do you blame for the mass of cameras going up all over 
Los Angeles? (Not to mention small, neighborhood microwave transceivers)

In the U.S., there's a thoroughly-implemented concept called co-opting, 
well described in senate hearings on intelligence circa 1974-1976. 
Fortunately, you were able in the above paragraph to get past the 
"choosing your own TRP" clause, and show the real cards.  So where in 
the U.S. are you gonna get TRP's who will not *ever* "leak" your files 
to an interested agency without proper warrant?

Whoops!  Looks like I spoke too soon.

And which trust is that, Bert?  They sure as hell don't trust us, now do 
they?  And unless you can show exactly where and when the "corruption" 
occurred, how do you know what was compromised?

How does it protect from criminals?  Only non-criminals (or extremely 
stupid criminals) will submit their data to a third party.

One principle you should keep in mind, Bert, and that is that 
cypherpunks are not merely paranoid (paranoia as a Way Of Knowing), 
they're very adept at telling you exactly how the criminals and 
terrorists will get around this hokum, and you're in denial about it.
