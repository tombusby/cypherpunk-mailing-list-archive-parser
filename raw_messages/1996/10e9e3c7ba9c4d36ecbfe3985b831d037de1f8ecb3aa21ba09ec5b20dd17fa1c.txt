The papers have been announcing recently that SAIC is buying 
Bellcore for ~$700M.  SAIC is the spook-connected beltway bandit firm
that recently bought the Network Solutions folks who run the Internet NIC.
Bellcore is the Bell Labs spinoff that the RBOCs have jointly owned since
the breakup of the Bell System a decade ago.  One of the interesting
things that Bellcore does is own and administer the North American
Numbering Plan, which is the telephone numbering space for
Country Code 1, including the US, Canada, and much of the Caribbean.
(Mexico used to have a kluged subset of 1, but a few years ago
decided to join with Latin America instead, gaining 5- prefixes.)

So you want an Internet domain name?  Ask SAIC.
You want a phone number?  Ask SAIC.
It's nothing to get all paranoid about, probably, but it would be
interesting to speculate what they can do with it, besides finding
a post-Cold-War income stream.

I wonder if the Ethernet address space or IPv4 or maybe IPv6 
addresses are their next acquisition?
