This is known as "creative editing". No, my question was not about "commercial
spam", but about controversial Usenet posts in general. Since you seem to have
my original e-mail, you have my permission to quote it in full.

I happen to be the owner of severallisteerv mailing lists, one of which is
fairly active. A few days ago someone forged subscription requests to all
three lists from a dozen notable personalities, including John Markoff,
Joshua Quittner, Emmanuel Goldstein (Eric Corley), et al. My understanding
is they were subscribed to several hundred mailing lists and some of them
had their mailboxes filled up.

It takes very little effort to send someone 200MB of e-mail these days. I
think I got several times that last time I got mailbombed by Nikki Sandru.
Do you customers realize they they might suddenly owe you hundreds of
dollars for the receipt of junk e-mail sent by some prankster?

This is another proof that Vince is a dishonorable man. An hnorable sysadmin
would protect his users from mailbomb attacks and make sure they are junked
or bounced. He wouldn't charge the victim money for being attacked.
