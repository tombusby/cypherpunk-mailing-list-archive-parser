Amidst all of the <exon> about the "fatal flaw", Mr. Scarenstein brings up
(amazingly) an interesting point regarding signed posts that I have wondered
about for a while.

The issue of knowing that a signed post belongs to a particular individual
has come up often.  Clearly the best approach is verifying the key in person
  Failing that, however, I have adopted a strategy of maximizing the
probablility that the key actually belongs to me.  I do this by:

        1.  Including the fingerprint and where to get the key in my
            signed post (within the pgp sig)

        2.  Putting the key in a fairly secure place (i.e. on a machine
            controlled by my employer, but where I can check the key
            periodically

        3.  Putting the same key on the keyservers

I could (and should) also place it on my web page as well.

This is not to say that someone could not impersonate me by creating a key
and placing it in all of these places, but I think it would be difficult,
and probably not worth the effort.  I am not real worried about this threat
(but heck, if someone really wants to impersonate me, I'd be flattered).

I think these measures are probably sufficient for a mailing list level of
discussion.  Any comments? (flames >/dev/null)
