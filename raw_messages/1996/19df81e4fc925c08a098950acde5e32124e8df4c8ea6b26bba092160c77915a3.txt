I have to agree.  One of the most impressive things I have seen as a 
modern "movement" (yes I realize cpunks are not an organized 
movement, relax) was the massive public relations job done by several 
core cpunks around the 1993 Clipper proposal.  People with largely 
divergent opinions found public ground in their opposition to 
Clipper.  Lets do that again.

One thing that will help is spreading the use of filtering.  Those 
interested in learning how to filter should be able to ask any of us 
and we should all respond ASAP.  The Noise is horrible in here, but I 
only hear it in my trash folder.

[BTW, Tim, thanks for being willing to withstand the crap you go 
through.  You, and others on this list, have consistantly challenged 
and changed my assumptions about society, law and privacy.  I dont 
always agree with you.  But I am glad you are here.]
