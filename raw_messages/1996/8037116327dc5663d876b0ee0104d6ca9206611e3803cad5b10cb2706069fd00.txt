They also definitely value their safety.  Sure, right now there are
lots of people who think strong cryptography is a good idea.  If
the Four Horsemen scenario is correct, that will change very quickly.

The reason I used this as a counterpoint is that the premise of
my discussion is that it would be possible - maybe even easy -
to suppress the use of non-GAKed cryptography were it unpopular.

A commonly shared belief among GAKers and Cypherpunks is that strong
cryptography is a magic bullet.  It isn't.  If it's not obviously
a disaster, strong cryptography will be widely used.  But if it
is a disaster and requires GAK, that's a policy option we will always
have.
