CYBERSPACE LAW FOR NONLAWYERS
-----------------------------

Three highly respected law school professors (Professor Larry Lessig,
University of Chicago Law School; Professor David Post, Georgetown
University Law Center; and Professor Eugene Volokh, UCLA School of Law)
have written a *FREE*, online cyberlaw workshop called, appropriately,
"CYBERSPACE LAW FOR NONLAWYERS."  CYBERSPACE LAW is specifically written
for lay people like you and me, and the workshop's lessons use
easy-to-understand English -- NOT legalese and Latin!


YEAH, BUT WILL I *UNDERSTAND* IT?
---------------------------------

Actually, yes. The workshop's authors really are writing CYBERSPACE LAW's
lessons for educated lay people, *NOT* lawyers.

I took a look at an earlier article written by one of the workshop's
professors (Eugene Volokh, "Cheap Speech and What It Will Do", 104 Yale
L.J.1805 (1995)), and I have to say that I am quite impressed ... although
I have to say that I am quite disappointed that Volokh did not have a
single Southern word *anywhere* in his article :)


WHAT WILL THE WORKSHOP COVER?
-----------------------------

CYBERSPACE LAW is going to help you learn the basic principles of -- and
unlearn some common myths about --

     - copyright law,
     - free speech law,
     - libel law,
     - privacy law,
     - contract law, and
     - trademark law

as they apply on the Net.  Each CYBERSPACE LAW "lesson" should be about the
size of an average TOURBUS post (about a page or two), and will e-mailed to
you through an e-mail distribution list.  The CYBERSPACE LAW workshop will
last a couple of weeks, and you'll get two or three letters a week from the
authors ... and, best of all, the entire workshop is FREE!
