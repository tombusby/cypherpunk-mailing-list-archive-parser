is now doing internet telephony (www.von.com). Who isn't?  They have developed a

set of voice morphing tools (www.voxware.com/meta.htm) and I quote:



"Morph-It offers an alternative. Morph-It allows multimedia developers and users to actually 

change, in real time, the character of encoded speech by altering resonance, pitch, timbre and 

other voice personality elements. With Morph-It, pitch and resonance can be altered 

independently. All these changes can be made and saved using a simple editor, and 

transformed voices can be stored as easy-to-apply VoiceFonts.



Morph-It can be used for a variety of purposes: 



Multiple voice personalities can be created from a single voice recording.

Users in "real-time" applications can disguise or alter their voices to enhance game- and 

role-playing.

Vocal character can be easily transformed into virtually any form, whether from male to 

female, or from a child's to an adult's." 



End quote.



I have not heard it work. Imagine drunken suits, in karioki bars, sounding 

like drunken Pavarottis,  disk jockeys whose true voices are nasel whines, 

talking-heads and telemarketers using highly tuned voice-clones, home-alone children 

answering the phone as John Wayne.
