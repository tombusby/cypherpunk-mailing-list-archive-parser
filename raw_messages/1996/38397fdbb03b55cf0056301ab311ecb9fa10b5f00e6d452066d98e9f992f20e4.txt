Don't overdo the CIS newsgroup "ban".  The first sysop to "ban" newsgroups
did so many years ago.  There are well-developed techniques to read "banned"
newsgroups.  A FAQ and everything.

Compuserve is just a large proprietary service and sometime ISP (and one of
the most expensive ones).  They are not a big player on the Net.

Luckily it's not and can't be.

Almost all of the articles on the CIS "ban" have mentioned that
"therapeutic" groups were also included.  Certainly the Net has let CIS know
what we think of them.  They expressed surprise at our reaction.

Their "ban" isn't even a ban as my piece on using CIS to read banned groups
shows.  (http://www.cs.umass.edu/~lmccarth/cypherpunks/banned.html)  It is
making it into Wired and the Baltimore Sun (maybe) and was good enough that
Michael Miller, author of "Using Compuserve" linked to it from his book
page:  http://www.mcp.com/people/miller/cistop.htm.
