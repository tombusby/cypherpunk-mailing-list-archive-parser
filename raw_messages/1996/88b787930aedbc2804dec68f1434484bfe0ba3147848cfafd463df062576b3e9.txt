..... elided...

And notice that increasingly the "journalists" are the quoted thinkers and
strategists in important areas? Someone majors in English, starts writing
for "Netizen" or "HotWired," and the next thing you know they're debating
crypto policy with Conrad Burns and Dorothy Denning. We're in an age where
the medium truly is the message

thanks for the deconstruction on 'WiReD' - --- your last comment reminds me of Cliff Stoll's position that the Web fosters what he calls 'cacocracy' --- a community of yakking posturers with nothing to say.

I recommend his "Silicon Snake Oil" to all.
Cheers.
