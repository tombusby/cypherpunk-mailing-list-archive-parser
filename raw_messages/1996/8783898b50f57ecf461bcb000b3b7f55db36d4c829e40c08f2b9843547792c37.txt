what is 'k'? there are N elements in the field as I understand
the terminology.

the short answer is that all the operations are redefined
somewhat to analogous operations that map into the range of integers.
division is not defined for results that are not integers.
actually division is replaced with an operation called "finding
the inverse mod n".

actually, this is a very important question that already gets
to the limits of current knowledge. the short answer
is that there is *no*proof* that this problem is "hard". in
fact such proofs are somewhat rare and exist mostly for contrived
problems. in computational theory what one does is prove that
your problem is at least as difficult as some other famous
problem that many people have tried to find efficient solutions
but have failed. this is called "NP Complete". as far as I know
there is no proof that "taking logs in a finite field" is
actually "hard". in fact there is no proof that factoring (an
equivalent form of the problem) is "hard" or even a proof that it is np 
complete.


most of this stuff is in the cryptography faq out there in
cyberspace. I am writing in hopes that someone might amend
the above by posting the latest academic thinking on the difficulty 
of factoring.
