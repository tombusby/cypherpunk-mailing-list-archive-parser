	Do you have a breakdown of that number? I'm working on one of my thought
experiments and am looking for the appropriate stats:


o THUGS V. GOVS 
  (during times of "modern" govts. 1800+)

Deaths by Govts. on "own people"

  US Civil War     x M
  US Native Americans
  Hitler: Jews     6 M
  Hitler: Others   6 M
  Stalin:         30 M
  China: Cult Rev  x M
  France: Rev      x M


  Deaths by Thugs

  Murders in whole world

	^^^ See to be valid, I think I'd have to including thugs all over the
world (since I use genocides all over the world) but if I had the
death/person US figure, I could multiply that by the whole world and have a
upper bound (conservative) since US has a partcularly large amount of murderes.
