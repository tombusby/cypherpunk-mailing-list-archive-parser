Of course they could exploit that.  But you're not "anti-believing" 
the information an untrusted party is passing.  Rather, you are not 
acting on their information in *any* fashion.  You're ignoring them.  
In the case of the common killfile, you may not even know that 
they're talking at you.

It is significant work.  How much work depends on how valuable the 
transactions you are considering are to you.

It's not as if the notion of reputation capital doesn't have precedent. 
When I make a purchase for my business, I do quite a bit of checking 
on the background of individuals and businesses I am purchasing from. 
The amount of reference work I do depends on how much I intend 
to spend.  Furthermore, I am much more apt to do business with 
individuals who have been referred by other trusted parties (a 
transfer of raputation capital).

Also my initial investment with a relative unknown is usually small.  
The repuatation capital of both parties increases relative to one 
another as a relationship is continued.

You seem to view the notion repuatation capital as absolute.  It is 
relative to each user of it.  The unnamed you are referring to did 
indeed come in with quite a bit of negative repuatation capital 
attached to his name.  While I might regard the opinions of others on 
the list as being valuable, I chose to see for myself if the unnamed 
person warranted his bad repuation.

In other words, I decide if an when he has "spent down to zero" with 
me -- even if we never directly communicate.

Why?  That depends on the sophistication of millions of Usenet 
readers (heh). 

I think your extension of this example is not useful.  It's 
impossible not to "intermingle it with other issues" such as the 
substance of the message itself, the ability to verify any factual 
information, etc. etc. ad nauseam.  

Reputation is but one factor in many and has a mostly negative effect 
if J. Anonymous Goumand is indeed anonymous.  Change J. Anonymous 
Gourmand to say, C. Everett Koop, and you can envision a more 
tangible example of reputation capital in action.
