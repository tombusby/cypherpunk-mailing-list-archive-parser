Effective immediately <amnesia@chardos.connix.com> is DOWN. I was
requested to terminate remailer service by my ISP, which has received
numerous complaints recently (from people who obviously don't have the
ability to read the headers correctly), and finally had enough. 

The acquisition of my own domain name should alleviate any future
objections, but this will have to wait till after the 1st of the year :(

For the next 10-15 days I will manually process any mail destined for
nymservers or just passing through to other remailers.
