First, the other nineteen shoot David Sternlight.  Then Perry and tcmay
get shot.  With the (now) absence of strong personalities to guide the
conversation among the remaining 8 robbers (should have shot tcmay
*before* he got his guard up) spend enough time arguing over trivialities
that the police show up and catch them all.

Moral: It is easier to herd cats than lead cypherpunks.
