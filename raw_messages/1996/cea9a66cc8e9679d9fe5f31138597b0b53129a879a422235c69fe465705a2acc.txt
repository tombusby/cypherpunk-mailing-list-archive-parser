For my Professional Ethics class I was charged to do an essay on something
topical and analyze it using the three main systems of ethics
(Utilitarianism, Kantian Rights, and Justice as fairness.)  I have pretty
much wrapped up the essay and was hoping I could get some feedback from you
guys (and gals, to be PC) about it.  It is supposed to stay under 5 pages,
and is intended for Joe non-crypto-user, so I wasn't allowed to ramble on
about crypto, but I would still like some feedback.

Anyone who is interested can obtain the document at:

and the original Word 7.0 version at:

Thanks,
Rick
