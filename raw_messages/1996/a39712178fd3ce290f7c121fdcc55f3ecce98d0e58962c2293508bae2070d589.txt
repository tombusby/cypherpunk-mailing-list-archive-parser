I doubt very seriously that this is anything more than a troll.

First off, the algorythms used to find polymorphics are sophisticated 
enough to detect newly published viruses.

Secondly, DOS/Windows et al. are not much more than boot sector viruses 
themselves. :-) Their structure is well know and there isn't any back 
door available to bang the OS from that hasn't already been exploited.

Real OS's like Unix, OS/2 etc. are also know quantities.

Binary launches are the way they do it, and the way a virus spreads, 
unless you get caught up with autoexecuting Word and Excel macros.

I have yet to see *any* truly data propogating viruses.

None the less, it is always a good idea to keep a scanner handy for 
thoses files that wander in off the Net. You never really know what 
they've been doing and who they've been doing it with. :-)
