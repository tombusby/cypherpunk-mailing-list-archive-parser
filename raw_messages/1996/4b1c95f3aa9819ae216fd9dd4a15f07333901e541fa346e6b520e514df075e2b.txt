I don't have a reference, I'm afraid, but I think I remember hearing about
someone using past keno numbers to predict future ones.  When they correctly
guessed all the numbers twice in a row, casino officials stopped the game and
were reluctant to pay (though, I think they eventually did).

Assuming I didn't dream the whole thing, it seems like it wasn't in Nevada...
possibly on an Indian reservation?  I think it happened 6 months to a year
ago.  I'm sorry I can't be more specific.
