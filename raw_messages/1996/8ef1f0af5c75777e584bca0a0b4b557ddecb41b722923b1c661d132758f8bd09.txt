Thanks for the note, I find it interesting and relevant to many things
I'm working on to eliminate this illegal harassing unsolicited spam.
(Note that my ISP, Panix, also has optional spam filters, started
within the last few months (forget date), actively being updated, and
they hoped that all ISPs would pick up on the idea, so as to drive the
spammers out of business.)

However, you make this claim that it has something to do with crypto
policy.  What?  That those who started TLG.NET, an entity improperly
considering technical requests to their postmasters to further deliver
email to their customers (as listed in administrative contacts for
their network designations (IP#s, domain names, etc.) that came back
as undeliverable to offending entities to stop (illegal) harassment as
a violation of first amendment rights, thus themselves becoming
parties of the harassment (and showing their udder stupidity, a trait
Brett Glass warned me of of some other functions some of their
founders have but that I initially didn't want to believe), are some
of the same people who operate this mailing list?  That's a rather
tenuous connection between crypto policy and spamming!  I see that in
the big picture they're all connected somehow, but please, let's be a
bit more accurate!  Jesus.
