    As I do not qualify as a legal historian or expert I don't have any 
definitive answer for you on this point.  My guess would be that it lies 
somewhere in the bowels of the legal system.  I recall hearing about some 
early cases involving operators listening in on telephone calls (which I 
believe they are still able to do as long as it is random and for 
purposes of "service checks") and how this was declared a violation of 
privacy to the calling parties.

    More likely, the "Right to Vote Out the Incumbents."

    I also think the majority of us can look at that and say "what a bad 
thing."  But the real question is what we want to do about it.

    Throw out the IR gogs then and look at the rest of the picture.  You 
still have the binoculars, the dish microphones and plain old eyes.  
Dosn't this pose a more reasonable comparison to your original topic of 
wiretaps?

   I have a feeling though that IR vision will become more accepted by the 
courts as a valid means of surveilance as its use increases.

    And unconveinent for those of us who would like to be able to record 
our conversations without the explicit permission of the other party.

    While that may have been some of their original intentions for 
passing such a bill, do you think people who are already involved in 
illegal activities would stop and think "Wait a minute, I can't ILLEGALLY 
record this bribe,"?  Such blackmails surely continue.

    Well, think about the situation.  The number of people who aren't
prosecuted after a wiretap is likely a small fraction of the whole number of
wiretaps (then again, how do we know?).  The number that find out they 
were under observation but not prosecuted is even more likely nil.  So, 
where are your chances to challenge this in court?  Where are the test cases?
Admitedly, Congress shouldn't have to wait for a case to take action to 
change this practice, but I doubt they are going to make a fuss about it 
before anyone else does.
