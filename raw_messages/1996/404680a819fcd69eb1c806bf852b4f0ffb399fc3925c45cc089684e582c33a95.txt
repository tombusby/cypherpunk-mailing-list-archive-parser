The DOJ and CIA sites were actually cracked; don't know the mechanisms.
The dole-kemp96.com and dole-kemp96.org domains were spoofs - they
have similar names to the real site, and people reach them by accident
or by hearing about them.  According to today's San Jose Mercury News,
the web designer who registered them did so just before Dole announced
Kemp as his VP, and tried to sell his design services to the campaign.
They didn't buy it, and the names were sitting around with nothing
better to do anyway, so he decided to have a good time with them.
Supposedly he's gotten about 40,000 hits and the "real" site got 1,000,000.

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
  and the politicians had to count them all.
