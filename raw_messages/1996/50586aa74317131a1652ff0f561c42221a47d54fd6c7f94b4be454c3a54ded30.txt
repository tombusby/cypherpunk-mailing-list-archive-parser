It sounds like a variant of the Haber and Stornetta work on digital
timestamping, about which much has been written on our list (check the
archives, and/or sections of my Cyphernomicon).

They have a company, Surety, which is doing this (or was, last time I heard).

www.surety.com will get you there.

My hunch is that your scheme implements a version of a hash (the idea of
hashing the doc and then publishing the hash as a "widely witnessed event,"
in Haber and Stornetta terms) that could infringe on their patents
(assuming they applied, as I recall hearing they did).

Before you go much further on this, it would behoove you to check on what
they are doing and on what patents, if any, you might need to license.
