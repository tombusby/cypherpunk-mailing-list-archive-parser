I was under the impression that sex involved physical presense. Are
you telling me that there are people out there somehow getting the
inanimate computers of people on the other side of the net to reach
out and rape the people sitting in front of them?

> Or that child pornography is a world wide trading game?

I must admit to having an odd viewpoint. I don't particularly care
about child pornography. Our nation seems to have an obsession with
the notion that somewhere out there someone is looking at a picture of
a naked boy or something. Myself, well, I am far from convinced that
the existance of child pornography is nearly as much of a threat to me
as the people who want to dismantle all our freedoms in order to stop
it. Most of the child pornography in the U.S. is distributed by the
FBI during stings, you know.

Yes. I also happen to have heard that people can impersonate you in
real life, too.

I suppose they will have to learn, won't they?

You realize that you are being extremely unconvincing?

And thats where CyberAngels, founded by Curtis Sliwa, the man who had
himself attacked to get publicity, comes in?

Feh.

I've had my address forged. I've been flamed. I've been
mailbombed. I've been sent anonymous death threats. I must admit that
I largely ignored all these things, and that at no time did I feel my
freedom was being threatened nearly as much by these events as it was
by Senator Exon.

The internet isn't a city. I live in a city -- a real city. I believe
that if I feel that I'm the subject of a serious death threat, there
is an actual 911 on my real life telephone to dial and talk to the
real life police in my real life city. Thanks, but no thanks.

No, but supporting censorship is.

Or, perhaps, that I'm not impressed by opportunistic newcomers with
strongly anti-libertarian viewpoints.
