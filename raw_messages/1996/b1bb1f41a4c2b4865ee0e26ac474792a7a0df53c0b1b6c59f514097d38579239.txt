Sameer's www.anonymizer.com is not blocked -- yet, at least. Some of the
programs release weekly updates, so as soon as it's reported by some
Net-groping pornhound, I'm sure it'll end up in there.

But the blocking apps do more than just check on URLs -- which do
constitute most of the databases. (I mentioned that CyberPatrol lists 4,800
web sites.) They also block by keywords. So going through a URL-redirector
to "playboy.com" or "xxxpix" would fail.

CyberPatrol is free for the download. Check it out! http://www.cyberpatrol.com/
