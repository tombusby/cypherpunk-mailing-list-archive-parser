Expect to be hearing about this being a problem 
with some child porn case real soon now... <sigh>

However - I can see this becoming VERY popular with the 
teenage crowd wanting to keep mom & dad out of their stash ;-)

That being said - Thumbs up to Kent for another crypto program 
that pushes the "genie" even farther out of the bottle.
