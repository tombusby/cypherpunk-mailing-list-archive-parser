Is it just my windows machine or are the security dialogs in
Netscape3.0b6 completely unreadable?  I get a dithered grey background
behind black text.  Can'tread the dialog boxes that show up when I see
a new cert.  

	(Speaking  of which,  there  seems to  be a  new long  list of
acceptable CA's.  Has  Netscape published a  policy doc explaining how
Adam's  Quik & EZ CA can get on the list?  And, those CA's should have
hyperlinks, so I can easily find  their policies for key signing, so I
can decide rationally that I don't trust the Post  Office  to  certify
things.  Right now, its just a gut feeling that they can't be trusted.
"Please don't call them junk certificates.")
