Some time ago on the list there was some discussion of putting
together a CD full of cryptographic software and reference material.
Nothing came of it, but I think several people expressed an interest,
for those of you who were interested, take a look at:

	http://www.sevenlocks.com/

Only problem is the price:

	http://www.sevenlocks.com/Encyclopedia.htm

		Single issue                           $195
           	One-year subscription (4 issues)       $695 ($174/issue)
                Two-year subscription (8 issues)       $995 ($124/issue)

Ouch!  Bit pricy, perhaps they justify it by the value added
information they've supplied?

Interesting that they keep the information up-to-date, one issue per
quarter.

They have a large supply of crypto software available on-line as well.
(No mention of ITAR on their software down load pages (78 Mb of
security related software they claim), and it looks you could download
the lot even if you weren't in the US).
