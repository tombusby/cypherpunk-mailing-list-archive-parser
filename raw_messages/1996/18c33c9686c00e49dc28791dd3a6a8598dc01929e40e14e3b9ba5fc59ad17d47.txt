We discussed this a bit at the Bay Area cpunks meeting yesterday.
It'd be fun to know the politics involved and what we'll get out of this,
but "easing export controls" could be anything from "dropping the limits
on anything but designed-for-the-military crypto" to "64 bits with escrow".
And, of course, "we'll release a policy statement in a few months" isn't
highly informative either.  On the other hand, it's an invitation for lobbying
and public comment, so we might as well take advantage of it.
