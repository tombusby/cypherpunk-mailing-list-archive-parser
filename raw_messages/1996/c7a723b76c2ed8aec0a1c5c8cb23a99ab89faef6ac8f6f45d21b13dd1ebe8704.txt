Basic marketing stuff:

(I just abbreviated from their survey, which you can
go back and change at any time :)

Full address, phone numbers optional.  How often do
you use this computer, and for what?  Which of the
following (shopping, bill paying, horoscope, etc...)
would you do online if you could?  Which online
services (AOHell, CI$, MSN, etc. ) have you used/do
you use? What is your profession? What is your income
level?  What about children? Which major appliances/
electronics do you use? What magazines do you read?
What about your free time? What hobbies/other interests
have you? (Optional question: have you traded any
securities in the past twelve months?)

OTOH, there is nothing at all preventing you from completing
all of this with your favorite pseudonym's information; Juno
says that they can't/don't verify all of this, since they just
don't have the resources or the inclination.

Besides, the ads are cute - so far, I've gotten ads for
Welch's grape juice, an Okidata laser printer, Columbia
House record club, and Snapple.  I already buy from three of
those four, so I guess they're preaching to the choir :)
