Response to Freedom Now! program on PBS, regarding expanding use of cryptography by individuals.

Unfortunately, the NSA representative (Mr. Baker?) on today's (3/3/96) show neglected to mention that the Clinton administration called for the introduction of the Clipper chip in *all* phones, NOT just those used by the government. This may be readily verified online via the archives at the EFF (http://www.eff.org), EPIC (http://www.epic.org), and even the White House' (http://www.whitehouse.gov) own ftp-able copies of the President's speeches.

Also missed was the fact that the Clipper chip would readily permit the implementation of what is called "traffic analysis" - knowing who spoke with whom, regardless of content. Traffic analysis data could readily be misinterpreted. If I were to make a dozen calls to a KKK office, traffic analysis would show such; it would *not* indicate whether the calls were in support of, or opposition to, the KKK's existence.

I found 'interesting' the NSA representative's emphasis of the fact that with the introduction of the automobile, the government's response was licensing and requirements for absolute identification. Extending that response, and the extensive licensing and identification procedures used to (legally) acquire (legal) firearms, to the use of cryptography and communications: are we going to see licensed telephones? Are we going to be obliged to present a National ID card before being able to use a public pay phone? Somehow, I have trouble equating a submachine gun to a Princess phone... but then, I'm not a (probably justifiably so) paranoid government official.
