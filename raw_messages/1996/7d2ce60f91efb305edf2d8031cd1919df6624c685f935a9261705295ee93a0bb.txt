        considering our history of persecution, and our acceptance of
    the bloody marches across America, driven my mobs --I doubt you
    could get an Jim Bell AP movement going.  despite the fact the
    Federal army (an entire army) occupied Utah for almost 50 years
    and the U.S. refused statehood for almost 50 years, everyone is
    still basically very patriotic.

        yeah, as a humourous thought for the theatre of the absurd, 
    active AP might be ideal in NYC, LA, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland,
    Buffalo, and the District of Columbia with surrounding regions.
    let them clean themselves up for 9 cents a pop.

    life, promising to keep you in crack heaven!?
