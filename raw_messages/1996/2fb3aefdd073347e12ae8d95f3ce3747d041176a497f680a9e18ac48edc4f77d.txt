Not much.

I seem to recall a quote from Dorothy Denning a couple of months ago where 
she actually held out API's as a way to get around the ITAR restrictions.  
It sounds to me like even that was too much for them!

In any case, this position is very desperate.  Those of us who recall old 
Altair computers remember a time where even a "file" was a foreign concept.  
Files are, arguably, a standardized format on which encryption programs 
work.  Are they going to stop the export of MSDOS?
