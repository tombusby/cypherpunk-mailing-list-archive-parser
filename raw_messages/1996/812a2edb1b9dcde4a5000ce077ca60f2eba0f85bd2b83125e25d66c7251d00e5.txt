Subject: HP ships full DCE internationally

As I sit, somewhere not in North America, I can see a CD-Rom from
Hewlett-Packard, which I've had since last year. Recently I received the
following letter. I've attempted to retype its contents accurately.

Dear HP-UX Support Customer,

Hewlett-Packard has uncovered a bundling problem in the DCE-Core fileset
that is on the October HP-UX Application Release 10.0 s700/800
Application CDs. These products were bundled such that they are not
compliant with U.S. Government export regulations. The part numbers for
the affected CDs and products are listed below.

If you have updated your systems using these CDs or for the products
listed on the October HP-UX Application Release Media, please update
your system with the enclosed January HP-UX Application Release 10.0
s700/800 Application media, and destroy the October media.

If you have not updated your systems with this media, please just
destroy the October Application Release media and use the new enclosed
Application media.

If you require a replacement for the October HP-UX 10.0 s700/800
Application CD that has this bundling problem corrected, please contact
your local support office to request shipment of the new CD.

Hewlett-Packard apologises for any inconvenience you may experience due
to this bundling issue.

Sincerely
