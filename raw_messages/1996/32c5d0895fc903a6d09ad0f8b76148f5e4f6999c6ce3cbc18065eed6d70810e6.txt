I worked with an algorithm which sounds similar to this one back about 20
years ago when creating a diff for VM/370 at Tymshare.  Here's a quick
description of the algorithm so you can see how much the hashing discussion
below applies to your problem.

(1) Chose a way to break the files into "units".  We chose line ends.
(2) Hash each unit in both files making two vectors of hashes.
(3) Identify which units exist once and only once in a file by:
(3a) Initialize a (large) vector of 2-bit entries to all zeros.
(3b) Use the hash of each unit to index the vector.  If the entry is 00
change it to 01.  If it is 01 change it to 10.  If it is 10 leave it alone.
(4) And the two 2-bit entry vectors together to get the units that exist
once and only once in both files.  These units are anchors of similarity
between the files.
(5) Find the hashes which represent these anchors of similarity in both
files and link them together.
(6) Link the neighbors of already linked units.
(7) The unlinked hashes represent differences between the two files.

Note that this algorithm finds units that have been moved.  I had to do
something intelligent with this information to allow for diff-like output.

To handle binary files you may need to change the definition of "unit".


We used a simple barber poll hash.  We went for a number of years before we
had a hash failure.  (I know, there was a bug in the code that handled hash
failures.)  A hash based on a CRC calculation would probably be better.
