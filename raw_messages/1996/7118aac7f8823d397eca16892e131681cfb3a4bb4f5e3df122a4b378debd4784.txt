	Well, an anon.penet.fi one has the disadvantage of not encrypting
between the final sendings.... which means that it's relatively easy to trace
back a given message to whatever remailer sent it, via traffic monitoring.
A forwarding remailer that decrypted mail according to a published key would
get around this, especially if it were being run out of a POP or other email
forwarding account (otherwise, the operator of the system could just look and
see what the private key was, and thus be able to trace back).
