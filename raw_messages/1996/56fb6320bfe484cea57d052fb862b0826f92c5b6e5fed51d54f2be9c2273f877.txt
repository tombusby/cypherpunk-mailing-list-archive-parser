Even ears are not perfect.  Recall the case of the pretender to the 
Romanov/Feodorovich dynasty, "Anna Anderson."  Three independent experts 
used ear profiles to confirm she was indeed the lost Tsarevna Anastasia, a 
judgment later proved wrong by a combination of handwriting analysis, trip ups, 
DNA, and the discovery of the actual Tsarevna's remains.

I can't cite sources, but the current doctrine is silly putty (tm).  Aside 
from looking much like flesh, being easy to apply and mold, it tends to 
absorb and radiate heat fairly well.  The result is a nice distortion of 
IR shots of ears.  While careful analysis will reveal the putty 
eventually, (it will always be somewhat cooler than the flesh) when properly 
applied, silly putty (tm) will so distort the actual ear profile as to 
render identification by this method alone nearly impossible.  

Users with darker skintones are told to add a mixture of blue and red 
food coloring to the putty.  Add salt to taste.
