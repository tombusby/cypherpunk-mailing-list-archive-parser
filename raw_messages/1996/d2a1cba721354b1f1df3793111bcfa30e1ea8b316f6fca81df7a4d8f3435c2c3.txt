I certainly believe this - PGP now has the first real challenge to its
continued viability.

I would like to emphasize (at the risk of repeating myself) that it now
looks quite possible that the limitations of S/MIME that I discussed at
the next-to-last cpunks meeting will be addressed. It hasn't been
formally decided, though. I'd say this is an important opportunity for
cypherpunks to make themselves heard. S/MIME as it is currently defined
has severe implementation weaknesses. There are two concrete proposals
on the table to fix these problems - lobbying the S/MIME people will
help.

Undoubtedly a combination of both.

Almost undoubtedly still illegal, unless Pro-CODE passes.

No. As currently defined, the Netscape API does not export mail.

I hear conflicting reports on this myself, but my best guess would be
some time this fall - probably just a month or two before PGP 3.0 ships
;-)

Agreed.
