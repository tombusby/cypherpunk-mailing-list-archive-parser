First of all, is that megabytes, or megabits?  I've forgotten how
many instructions it takes to do RC4, but RC5 takes 8-10 per round per
pair of words encrypted, so it should do about 1/2 bit per instruction for
16-round.
Some processors can do more than one instruction per clock cycle,
though loads and stores are usually a bit slower.  But you only need to
load two words every 128-160 clocks, which is easy on a pipelined machine.
So maybe it's a typo, but it should be far faster than 164 kB/s.
