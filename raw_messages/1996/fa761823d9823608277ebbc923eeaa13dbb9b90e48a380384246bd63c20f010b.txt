> It seems that there is a possibility that I, as CEO of Dutch
> internetprovider Xs4all, could get arrested by German authorities.
> 
> This seems a bit far-off, but he is not the only person that
> warned me about this possibility. People in the left-wing movement

> German government against the Radikal publications. Subscribers

> by them that the German Authorities would not easily stop their
> censorship of radikal. There seems to be a lot of old pain.
> 
> Contemplating a bit further about the risk of being arrested,
> I thought about these developments on a larger scale. The first
> thing that popped to mind is that all the owners of the Radikal
> mirror-sites may also be arrested if they ever visit Germany. These
> are over 30 people and organisations. One of the sites Radikal was
> mirrored on is EFF. The Board-members of EFF could, in theory, 
> be held responsible by the German Authorities. John Perry Barlow
> could be arrested next time he comes to give a lecture in a 
> German city, because the EFF has illegal German documents on
> it's website. Declan McCullagh has put the Radikal information
> in the Well. He and the managers of the Well might be questioned
> when they enter Germany. Et cetera. It would be an outrage if

> These acts of agression against ISP's and internetusers will profoundly
> change the Internet if they'd be tolerated.

> The possibility of being arrested in our neighbour country is almost
> too surreal to think about. But now people start telling me to seriously
