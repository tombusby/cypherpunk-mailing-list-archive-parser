I have IE3 configured to ask me for permission to accept a cookie. Yes, 
some sites send (n!)+1 cookies during a session. If they send too many, I 
personally move on to another site, after sending them email (!).

Sorry for the confusion - the refuse-it policy I mentioned is a personal 
policy; there's no option (yet) to configure something like that in IE3. 
The only two things I've personally seen have been cookies with specific 
expiration dates (which I usually accept, if the date is reasonable 
[IMHO]), and cookies that don't display an expiration (which I refuse 
out-of-hand). It seems to be a compromise that suits _me_; YMMV.

I can 'automate' to the extent of automatically accepting all cookies; yes, 
by not accepting every cookie, I'm obliged to make a decision for each 
request. One of the 'benefits' of being somewhate security-aware :-)
