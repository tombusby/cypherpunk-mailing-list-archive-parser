Those cards are not debit cards. They are used to track a players time
and money spent playing slots and other games. I have a stack of them. 
Whenever I go to the blackjack tables, I give mine to the pit boss
and he writes down the amount of money I am gambling with and time spent
at the table. 

The only thing the cards are used for is "comps". I get a free prime rib
dinner after playing for "x" amount of points. I think the case will
either get thrown out of court, or the casino will drop charges. Since
the points have no monetary value, the fraud charge probably will not
stick (if that is what they were charged with). The two hackers will
probably get a call from "Guido" reminding them never to step foot back
in Vegas.
