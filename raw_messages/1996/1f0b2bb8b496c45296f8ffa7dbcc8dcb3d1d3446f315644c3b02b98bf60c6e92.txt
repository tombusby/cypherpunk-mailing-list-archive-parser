Adam,
Yes, and that's good news.  We can claim, while we are building up our
infrastructure, that we have a low-quality service that cannot compete
with the current LD carriers.  Meanwhile, several companies and committed
enthusiasts are solving IPhone's technological problems.  Also, ATM and
other high-bandwidth technologies that the LD carriers are deploying can
bring them profits when IPhone users request the _fast_ Internet.

But the real money is in the billing system.  And an efficient,
decentralized ecash infrastructure will change the world.  A cheap
telephone-to-telephone long distance and international voice service,
which people do want to buy, could provide the cash flow to jump start it.
