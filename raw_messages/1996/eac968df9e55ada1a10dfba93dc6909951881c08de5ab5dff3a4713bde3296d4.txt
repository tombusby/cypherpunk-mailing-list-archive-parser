I have no joke. I just like saying, "barratry.law.cornell.edu." Oh, and
the full-text availability of recent net.relevant decisions (numero dos)
should be useful to somebody.

So how do I get to be the Unabomber's pen pal? Hmm, what jail was he in
again? I wonder if they'll accept packages for him with excessive postage.

The announcement:
================================================================
                                             April 11, 1996

Two New Services from Cornell's Legal Information Institute

I. Landmark Supreme Court Decisions

 Cornell's Legal Information Institute is pleased to announce the
addition of important "new" decisions to its Supreme Court collection.
Under a license, recently concluded with InfoSynthesis, publishers of
the USSC+ CD-ROM, the LII will be placing a steadily growing number of
historic decisions on its WWW server.  The first of these historic
decisions are now in place, including: Brown v. Board of Education (I
and II), New York Times v. Sullivan, The "Pentagon Papers" case, and
Bakke.  These join an existing collection of important decisions dealing
with privacy, the First Amendment, administrative law, patents, and
copyright.
 All decisions in this collection carry links to current U.S. Court of
Appeals decisions in which they are cited (using the LII's full-text
index of Court of Appeals decisions on the Net) and to other related
documents in the LII collection (e.g., statutes, topical summaries, the
Constitution).
 The "new" cases are accessible from the base address for Supreme Court
materials
  http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/
or directly at
  http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cases/historic.htm
Additions will follow on a regular basis.

II. LII's Eye on the Courts

 Joining the current awareness services already offered by Cornell's LII
-- BigEar (http://barratry.law.cornell.edu:5123/notify/buzz.html),
liibulletin and liibulletin-ny (see
 http://www.law.cornell.edu/focus/bulletins.html) -- is a new WWW page
providing links to newsworthy decisions handed down by any of the many
appellate courts now covered on the Net, along with relevant
background, when available. LII's Eye on the Courts can be found at
  http://www.law.cornell.edu/focus/liieye.htm
