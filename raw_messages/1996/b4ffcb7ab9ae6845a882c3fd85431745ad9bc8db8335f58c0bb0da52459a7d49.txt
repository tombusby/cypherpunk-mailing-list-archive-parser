Well, I'll separate it for closer review:

>> While the sentence

>> to a felony," not the "obstructing" of that communication.

The problem is that the original sentence (in the proposed law) is 
ambiguous.  But I think the most likely interpretation is that it is the 
"information" which is in "furtherance of a felony," and "obstructing the 
commmication" of that information is the crime they define.

The law is POORLY worded.  Padgett Peterson noticed this yesterday, BTW, and 
commented on it on Cypherpunks.  You've stumbled on the alternate meaning 
that he complained about.  Realistically, however, I think we can probably 
agree that this meaning was not the one they intended; that's why for 
purposes of analysis I study the other meaning.

I think I disagree.  What we need, however, is an "emergency-call English 
major" who could diagram the various possibilities for us and we could 
study them separately.  There's plenty of ambiguity in this sentence; but I 
think that is absolutely intentional.

That depends on who you believe actually wears the white hats...

Well, I invite you to try to construct an interpretation of the sentence in 
as many ways as you can imagine.  I think you'll discover that it is 
practically intended to mislead.

Justa sec... I think you've forgotten that merely running an anonymous 
encrypted remailer could be considered "willful obstruction."  Now, if the 
communication wasn't "in furtherance to a felony" then it wouldn't be 
criminal (it would be a LEGAL "willful obstruction, right?) , but then again 
the operator wouldn't know that, would he?  

Which brings us to yet another ambiguity:  The operator of an anonymous 
encrypted remailer wouldn't know that any given packet was "in furtherance 
of a felony" but he MIGHT be absolutely aware that any one of them COULD be! 
 Does this rise to the level of violating the law?  If not, why not?

Who, in this case, is "the enemy"?  As far as I can see, "the enemy" are the 
people who wrote this section of the bill.

While it's been a few decades since I last diagrammed a sentence, I will 
start by putting parentheses around sections of this sentence to separate it 
into what I believe is its "intended" meaning.  


>> 2804. Unlawful use of encryption to obstruct justice

>>    impede, or prevent) the communication of (information in furtherance

I challenge anyone to re-write this section to:

1.  Achieve what he believes to be a "reasonable" result and

2.  Avoids the criticisms that I've previously mentioned WRT this portion of
the 
bill.


Also, I think anyone who supports this kind of section should be able to 
give me a few examples of crimes whose investigation has (or could be) 
thwarted in a way that would violate this section.  I've said it before and 
I'll say it again:  The average citizen is essentially never the victim of a 
crime of this type.  For whom, then, is this law written?  I think it's 
written for the benefit of the politicians alone.  They want to live.
