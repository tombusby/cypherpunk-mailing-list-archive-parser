Thanks to Eric Eden for forwarding a copy to cypherpunks. I'd like to 
comment on the proposed set of authentication options (authorization schemes).

I realize this is meant to be the simplest/least-secure option. Nevertheless,
it seems to me that checking the "From " header instead of the "From:" header
would increase the security of this option at essentially no computational
cost. (I think "From " is commonly called "From_" in the literature these
days.) From_ is harder to forge than "From:", although that's not saying a
great deal.

Might I assume that the current InterNIC practice is to check "From:" ?
If so, you might consider switching to From_ in the interim, before the
Guardian Object stuff gets implemented.

I think that Unix's md5(1) would be a better transformation choice. It is 
available to a similar extent as crypt(3), and is more inversion-resistant.
I'm not sure how the speeds compare. What sort of volume of update messages 
does InterNIC anticipate handling ?  

Also, if you use a hash function such as MD5, you don't need to fool around
with doing something like E_pass(pass). 

In Section 9.3, it says:

I certainly appreciate the sentiment expressed here that "security through
obscurity" is a wash. However, in this particular situation I don't think
that's the right issue. Keeping the details of a security algorithm or
protocol is rather dubious in many cases. But it's entirely reasonable and
good for a security protocol to specify that some sensitive application data 
handled by the protocol will be hidden. Encryption is, after all, a way to
hide information....

Let me wax concrete now. :} If a Guardian uses CRYPT-PW and the authentication
information appears in the public WHOIS database, then an attacker can learn
crypt(3)_KEY(pass) just by looking up the WHOIS entry. Assuming the Guardian 
isn't hassling with managing a distinct key to encrypt the password, then the
attacker knows crypt(3)_pass(pass). Now she is all set to do an offline
password guessing attack. So exposing the ciphertext of the encrypted password
introduces a weakness.

More importantly, the CRYPT-PW protocol is subject to a replay attack. A 
passive attacker just needs to eavesdrop on an update message to learn the 
plaintext password. Then she can forge additional update messages using the 
purloined password, causing annoyance to Guardians using AFTER-UPDATE
notification and disruption to those using NOT-CARE update notification 
(i.e. none).

As far as I can see from the draft, the contact update templates do not
include date or time information. This makes the protocol vulnerable to 
a simple replay attack. An attacker can record update messages and replay
them to InterNIC later. 

Depending upon a Guardian's notification status, this could allow the 
attacker to confuse things by restoring an old contact information record. 
Even if a Guardian is using BEFORE-UPDATE, she might not notice that a
subtle change has been undone. An update notification message arriving on 
the heels of a similar one might get approved by a Guardian, who chalks it
up to a mail transport glitch.

Requiring some sort of timestamp field in the signed portion of the contact
templates would be good.

Any hints on what this will be like ?

Hope this helps. Feel free to ask questions.
