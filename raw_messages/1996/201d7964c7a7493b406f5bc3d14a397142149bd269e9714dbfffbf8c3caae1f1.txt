Well, if your modems says to "hell with the switch", you can do a lot of 
things with frequencies. And since the filters in the switch are not that 
accurate, you *might* get away with 3400 hz, which I doubt. Now if your 
phonecompany for what reason ever supports more bandwidth, thats good for 
you, but try to get your 3600 baud = 3600 hz modem to be accepted by the 
FCC will pose a problem, since it states in the regulations, that a modem 
has to stick to the 300-3400 hz band limits.

Huh?
