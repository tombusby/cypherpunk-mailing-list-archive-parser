Your "grasp" of literature gives the list my answer without me having to
say a word.

I notice you chose to ignore the factual political examples I gave.  Not
that this surprises me.  "Your" concept, of rule by terror, has thousands
of examples in historical context.

I simply refuse to debate the matter any longer as it is clear you are not
open to reasoned debate, nor, it would seem, are you clearly possessed of
reason.
