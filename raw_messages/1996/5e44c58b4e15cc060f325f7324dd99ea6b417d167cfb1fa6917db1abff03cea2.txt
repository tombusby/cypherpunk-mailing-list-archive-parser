Actually, this makes sense for another reason.  Academic
cryptanalysis is often about finding any attack on a cipher that's
easier than keysearch, even if the requirements for that attack are
still completely impractical.  (Differential and linear attacks on
DES are a good example of this.)  However, if you're interested in
actually recovering data in your attacks with high probability and
low cost, then it makes sense to focus on protocol and
implementation weaknesses, and then on attacks like keysearch which
can be done with either ciphertext-only or known-plaintext.

I would guess that some of NSA's best people work on optimizing
keysearches.  This especially makes sense because of the widespread
use, first of DES, and more recently of exportable 40-bit ciphers
like RC2 and RC4.

The paranoid conclusion is that there is a significant weakness in
any cipher you're counting on.
