Process of elimination.
If the document that goes to a newsgroup is document #5, then you can
concentrate on the path after #5.  Which newsgroup is it?  Easily
determined by selectively seeding documents to different newsgroups.  You
get the idea.  Message pools complicate the process, but are not
impossible to deal with, particularly when output to the newsgroup can be
controled, as it can here, either by killing the feed the the group, or to
the party posting there.

This all of course begs the question as to whether this is even a good
idea, you address it below:

Agreed.  But not because it is technically impossible.

Not really.  Simply continue to seed and watch new subscriptions to the
list.  That narrows down the leak quite well.

Same thing as winding up agent nets that use dead-drops.  Identigy one
step at a time.

Agreed.

Mostly agreed.
