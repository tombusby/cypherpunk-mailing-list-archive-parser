Please don't send me extra copies of mail sent to cypherpunks. I put
that Reply-To: header in there very deliberately.

No, a program that doesn't obtain your passphrase at all.

Go back and read what Mike Ingle wrote 
(http://www.hks.net/cpunks/cpunks-24/1540.html)

He said "Instead of messing with user interfaces", and talked about a program
that "encrypts any mail it has a PGP key for the recipient of". That
sounds a hell of a lot like a program with no user interface to me. 
Furthermore, in my sheltered life, I don't know of any mail proxies that
have user interfaces. Mike has given absolutely no indication that the
program he proposes makes any attempt to base its decisions on user input,
including passphrases. Hence my original question.

I'm very happy for you if you have in mind a program that does something
different. But I don't see how it's relevant to whatever questions I
might ask about the program Mike Ingle has in mind.
