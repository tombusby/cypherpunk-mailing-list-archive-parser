I know Bruce and his problem is quite real.  I happened to have the three keys
that he is wanting to revoke in my keyring.  (And one of them he had forgotten
he had made at all.)  It would be nice if there was a way to use the "web of
trust" to certify a key revokation in the same way that one signs a key.
Basically get a couple of your friends who are accepted in the crypto community
and have them vouch for the actual loss of the key(s).  It would certainly help
patch the problem.  (It might open up things for spoofing anyways.  There would
have to be a way of overriding such a thing with the real key, but that would
require the passphrase.  (Which should be available if not lost.)) An idea at
least...
