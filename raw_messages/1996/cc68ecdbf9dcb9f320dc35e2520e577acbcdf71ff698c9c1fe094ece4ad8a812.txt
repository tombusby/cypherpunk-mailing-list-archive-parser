Why is it that personal freedom, sometimes expressed by choice of dialect
or language, seemingly has such arbitrary limits?  Many on the list
complain that they are subject to too many rules, and yet, seem to chime in
on multi-linugual issues in this way.

Crypto angle, here?  Much of Ebonics has been based upon a need or desire
to communicate in a private way.  "5-0" was initiated as a way to
communicate the presence of a police officer.  Surely, we are not arguing
against the development of a low-level way to scramble language.  Or in
fact, are you arguing that attempts to curtail the police should *not* be
encouraged?  This seems odd coming from some members of the list (Collapse
of Governments and all) ;-).
