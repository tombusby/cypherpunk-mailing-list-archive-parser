-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The keyserver running at pgp@pgp.mit.edu is once again operational. It is
using new keyserver software. The old keyserver software was a collection
of perl scripts that invoked PGP to do its key management. The new server
is written in "C" and does its own key management, complete with appropriate
indices.

Not all email commands are implemented. However "GET", "ADD" and "INDEX" (when
given an argument to look for) do work. Response is immediate (plus or minus
e-mail delays).

The best on-line way to use the keyserver is via the World Wide Web at:

Enjoy.
