A wonderful little annoucement for a new WWW site appeared in my anon
mail this evening, It was for a site offering Privacy Tools and Offshore 
Activities, Poor guy who sent the message,  sent it without BCCing it
and hence, Everyone who requested his autoresponder file on Anonymous
Banking is listed. (At least 100+ addresses!)  

Highlighs of the domains in the mailing:

nea.org       Gotta keep some money stashed for education!
uspto.gov     Nym's requesting infomation for hiding patent $$$
mot.com       Good year for Motorola stocks!
fmr.com       Fidelity Investments....Hmmmmm

I'll bet my last E-Ca$h coin that there will be alot of these people learning
about anonymous remailers the hard way.
