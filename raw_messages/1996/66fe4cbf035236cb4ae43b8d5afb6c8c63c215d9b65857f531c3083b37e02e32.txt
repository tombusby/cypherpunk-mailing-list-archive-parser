See Claude Shannon's papers on information theory. [Available as: C.E.
Shannon, Collected Papers: Claude Elmwood Shannon, N.J.A. Sloane and
A.D. Wyner, eds., New York: IEEE Press, 1993.]

Shannon invented information theory in 1948 and 1949. Part of his
papers discuss the information theory of cryptosystems. He
mathematically proved that only a O.T.P. using non-reused physically
random numbers could provide what he termed "perfect secrecy".  I
accept mathematical proofs above the Koran or the Bible. (The Torah is
a subset of the Bible.)

It is not possible.

The information content, or entropy, of the key stream is necessarily
no larger than its keyspace. That is, if you have a software
pseudo-random number generator using an N bit seed, the entropy of the
keyspace is necessarily never greater than N. This is mathematically
certain -- no amount of prayer on your part can change that.

Sorry, its even better -- a MATHEMATICAL fact.

von Neumann meant any deterministic algorithm, actually.

If it is a PRNG, you do not have a One Time Pad, period. What you have
is a stream cipher.

Furthermore, past examination has shown you have a POOR stream cipher.

If the entropy is limited, you do not have a One Time Pad, period, end
of discussion, its over.

Set by WHOM? By you? Your criteria bear no resemblance to those
accepted in general. Are you one of those people who sells someone a
loaf of bread and says "this is an automobile, by every criterion I
have set for automobiles"?

Something different from what everyone else means, so it makes no
difference.

I believe that we have already established that your cipher is easy to
crack, so your claims that it is hard to crack really don't matter.
