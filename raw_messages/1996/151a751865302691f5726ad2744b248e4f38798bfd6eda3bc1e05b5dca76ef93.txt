The V-chip described heretofore is considerably less nuanced than this,
having only a few states (roughly corresponding to MPAA movie ratings). No
switch settings to block Democrat programs, or Feminist programs, or Mormon
programs. Just your basic "indecency," with "violence" as lagniappe.

And most Cypherpunks would tend to reject it because it is not voluntary
(unless you think "so don't buy a television" is a viable voluntary
choice). It will add to the cost of t.v.s and VCRs, and possibly interfere
with the computer-based options to come.

And it's easily defeatable. For one thing, most households have multiple
t.v.s or VCRs, any one of which without the V-chip will defeat the system.
Also, it is likely that the households "most in need" of this chip--using
the logic about unattended children watching violent programs while their
parents are away--will be the least likely to buy the brand-new sets and
VCRs that have this chip. (I would guess that most families will have
existing sets and VCRs for at least the next decade or more.)

This is mostly the case.

My objection to ratings systems imposed by government is a general one. If
video and music is to be rated, why not articles and Usenet posts? The
principle is the same.

Anyone telling me I have to rate my work, or submit it to a ratings agency,
is aggressing against me. Now, if others rate my work (which is already
happening with digest services such as "CP-Lite"), this is their business,
not mine. But the V-Chip precedent is a precedent for the government to
insist that all sorts of content be rated. This should be fought in a free
society.
