While that's obviously an imperfect analogy he gave, I think it's inadvertently 
instructive for an unobvious reason:  Governments are  _supposed_ to be 
products of the will of the people (at least, in so-called "freedom-loving" 
societies they are).   If that's the case, then if society decides that 
governments should be reduced or even eliminated, those governments should 
have no objection.  To whatever extent they DO have an objection, it can 
only be because the government is no longer representing the population as 
it was supposed to do, but has started to represent the vested interests of 
people whose livelihood depends on that government.  And to whatever extent this is 
happening, that's all the more reason to get rid of that government.

Unfortunately, that's exactly the position we find ourselves in today.
