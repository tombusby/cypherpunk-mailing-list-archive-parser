Actually, it was _I_ who mentioned this quote, but didn't specifically 
recall whom to ascribe it to.  Perhaps Tim May didn't see it; a week or so 
ago May engaged in a shotgun-type killfile addition, including me when I was 
merely ( I still believe...) the victim in a local flamewar.  If there is 
somebody out there who:

1.  Is on speaking terms with Tim May.
and
2.  Has a little respect for my commentary, I would very much appreciate it 
if you would forward this comment to him to ensure that he sees it. 

The truly ironic thing is that Tim wrongly ascribes the comment to Alan 
Olsen, who is apparently the (recently admitted) perpetrator of at least one
flamewar 
against me.
