In addition to all the points made below, security would be extremely important
for a remailer cgi script.  If security holes were found in the source code,
it might discourage many web admins from running the script even after the hole
is patched.

Since maintaining a block list is probably one of the most time-consuming tasks
involved with operating a remailer, it would be a Good Thing to add an option
to the remailer cgi program to operate as a "middleman" remailer.  This would
only require the remailer operator to add or remove entries from a list of
allowed destinations.  The operator wouldn't have to deal with disclaimers and
would only receive complaints from other operators if the remailer is
malfunctioning in some way.

I don't know if any perl modules or *.ph files exist that implement http/https.
Http should be pretty easy, but https would require SSL code.  I think there
are perl modules that contain crypto functions, so https could use the
functions provided in the module.  Netcat can be used pretty easily to fetch
URLs (e.g. echo "GET /foobar.html HTTP/1.0" | nc www.webserver.com 80).  This
will print out the HTML files and cooresponding MIME headers on stdout.
