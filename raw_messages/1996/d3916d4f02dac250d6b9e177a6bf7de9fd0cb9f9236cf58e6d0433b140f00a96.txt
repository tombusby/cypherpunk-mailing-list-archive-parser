The NT Resource Kit has a cute little C2 compliance advisor that steps
you through a number of points that affect the C2 compliance of the
system.  My favorite is the section under 'Networks'.  It simply says
"C2 compliance require that the machine not be connected to a network."

Drawing from another message (attribution lost, sorry), if you have the
NT DDK, you need not be a particularly clever device driver writer to
write a malicious driver.  The DDK comes with _lots_ of example source
code.  You need one of {deep pockets | beneficient employer} to equip
for mayhem, though.  (MSDevNet Pro subscription is $499 and VC++ 4.0
subscription is ~$395) (thanks, boss!)
