	A more precise URL is
http://www.cnet.com/Content/News/Files/0,16,2181,00.html. There's a link to a
copy of the original letter. It looks like the UK police are coming down with
delusions of grandeur; they want to eliminate the newsgroups in question from
the Internet/Usenet period, not just block them from the UK. People may want to
look out for cancel messages for these groups coming from the UK, for instance,
and ignore the lot of them.
