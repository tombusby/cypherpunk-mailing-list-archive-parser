This is such crap, and I'll tell you why.  It is a classic example of 
political double speak.  Here Hillary says that children are in 
danger because of lost family values.  Absolutely true.  Let me ask 
you then why is it that Bill(ary) signed an unconstitutional law?  I 
am referring to the CDA and the telephony bill.  What about the 
terrorism bill?  They apparently support censorship on the Internet.  
They don't want "bigtitties.gif" on the net and accessable to little 
Johnny.  They say that it is WRONG for little Johhny to have access 
to "bigtitties.gif," and that the GOVERNMENT should DO SOMETHING 
about this.  What happened to family values?  Just HOW the hell can 
you support and promote family values when you are telling the 
parents (who you want to pay more attention to their children, get 
more involved, and be kinder) "WE know what is best for little 
Johnny, and WE will make the decisions, NOT YOU"  To me this sends a 
message of "The government knows best because most parents are stupid 
and uncaring."  

It is much more likely that little Johnny will go over to Sammy's 
house and look at the Playboys that Sammy's dad has hidden under the 
bed than collect nudie .gifs off of the net, but they wouldn't dare 
censor that.  The Internet is another story, however.  I got news for 
them, we had pornography LONG before the net ever existed, and there 
is NO solid psychological link to viewing porn and becoming a sex 
offender.  Anyone who thinks so needs to realize that they are 
talking about something about which they have no clue.

Anyway, getting off-topic again.  I'll be quiet now :)
