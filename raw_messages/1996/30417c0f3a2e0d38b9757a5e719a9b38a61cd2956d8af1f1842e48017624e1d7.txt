Not lately?  And why is that?  How is an abused child going to be helped
by encryption?

That's just rhetoric.  What normal state of mind?  I understand the
argument against "big government", but *coincidentally*, as government
has gotten bigger over the last 50 years or so, children's lives have
gotten much better.  It was common to have neighbors in a city 40 years
ago (I remember) who beat their kids so bad you could hear them several
houses away.  You don't hear that today.  Coincidence?

In other words, if it doesn't offer something for me, the selfish adult,
I don't wanna hear it.  You can't have just one side of the discussion,
because there are too many people like me around to remind you that there
is the other side too.
