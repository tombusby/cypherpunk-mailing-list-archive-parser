    why would they release *this* one?
 
  meaning the NSA study on how crypto regulations affect

  On 01 13 96 I wrote a message to the list headed "ITAR

  Subject: ITAR Re-write ? 

 
 
  Friend, 
 
 
  Bloomberg, the business news agency, reports 01 12 96: 
 
     The U.S. Commerce Department will recommend easing 
     export controls on encryption software after a study by 
     the department and the National Security Agency found 
     that American firms are being hurt.... 
 
     The report's release came on the same day federal pro- 
     secutors dropped a three-year investigation...of...Philip 
     Zimmerman.... 
 
     The government study comes a week after [the Computer 
     Systems Policy Project] released [its] own study showing 
     ...American companies will lose [maybe $60 billion] in 
     U.S. computer system sales expected in 2000.... 
 
 
  The 13-member Project 
 
     ...includes International Business Machines...and AT&T.... 
 
 
  Perhaps the let-go of Zimmerman is less a triumph of right 
  than of might? 
 
  But economic might is not the only kind of might: 
 
     [Easing export controls] may pit Brown's department a- 
     gainst U.S. defense and spy agencies.... 
 
 
  So... 
 
     [Commerce Secretary] Brown said his department will pre- 
     pare recommendations for easing [ITAR] controls that 
     should be forwarded to the president "within a few months." 
 
 
  Meaning: the 13 Project members should be prepared to pay 
  through the nose in the runup to the '96 gala. 
 
  And just so they get the big picture: 
 
     It's unclear if the NSA, the super-secret eavesdropping 
     agency, endorsed the Commerce Department's conclusions 
     in the report it jointly prepared. 
 
 
  The newsstory reports 
 
     ...federal prosecutors dropped [the Zimmerman] investiga- 
     tion without explanation.... 
 
 
  No explanation's required.  One hostage was released.  13 
  others were taken.  But the one release does afford the new 
  hostages, who have deep pockets, some hope... 
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim
