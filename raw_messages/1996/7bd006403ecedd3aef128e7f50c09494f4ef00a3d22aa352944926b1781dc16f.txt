In order to get government approval of CAPI, Microsoft made concessions
that we will doubtless find offensive.  But once CAPI is in place and
working, then those concessions can be taken back.

CAPI is a good thing:  It is sound design and it will open another 
front in the conflict.  Once software is around that has crypto hooks in it, 
we can then deal with restrictions on CAPI modules using technical 
and political means.  I expect that technical means will be effective 
and successful.
