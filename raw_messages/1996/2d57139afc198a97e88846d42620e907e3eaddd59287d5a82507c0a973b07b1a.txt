I doubt this is going to become a mass-market phenomenon, but some people
seemed to be interested in E.

Subject: CandleWeb V1.1 - Web client with interactive animation support

CandleWeb AS is pleased to announce version 1.1 of the CandleWeb client.
The client is freely available for Windows 95 and X11. Precompiled versions
exist for Windows 95, Linux, Sunos 4 and Irix. 

CandleWeb is a powerful and easy way to create interactive animations and
applications for use on the Web. The CandleWeb client is an interpreter
for the language E(pronounced like "awe" in english). CandleWeb features
include :

- - Vector graphics objects to reduce bandwidth requirements and simplify
  animation development. 

- - Bitmap graphics(GIF and JPEG).

- - Sound (MIDI and WAV).

- - User-interaction objects.

- - Web-protocols support. http(GET/POST), ftp, and file URLs are
  supported. Access to file URLs is by default prohibited due to security
  considerations.

- - Portability and architecture independence.

- - Security, interpreted programs is executed in a safe environment. 

The client has builtin damage-repair and double-buffering to achieve high
performance graphics. Animations are easier to create in E than in
traditional languages, due to the declarative nature of the E
graphicssystem.  

AweThor is an authoring tool for CandleWeb that simplifies the task of
creating animations and graphics in E. AweThor is available as shareware
for $100(US).

New features in this release of CandleWeb :

- - Composite objects. The language now has support for user-defined
  composite objects. 

- - Support for dynamic loading of libraries and automatic revision control
  to store library copies locally.

- - A new parser written in PCCTS has allowed us to clean up the language,
  and bring it somewhat closer to the C programming language in syntax. 

- - Global variables. 

- - Local function declarations.

- - Regular expressions, through the new function regmatch.

- - Support for MIDI and WAV on Win95 and Unix platforms using the Unix
  Sound Standard(USS). Linux has support for USS. Can play single or
  continuous sounds asynchronously.

- - Better color support for X11 :
  1. 24-bits support.
  2. On PseudoColor it does not install a private colormap by default
     anymore.
  3. Use the -perfect option to install a private colormap.
  4. When -perfect is specified it uses a dithering technique to achieve
     2048 virtual colors.

- - HTTP post is now supported through the function post().

- - Other new builtin functions : optimizeObjects, contentType, substr,
  getWindowSize, read, write, and link.

- - New functionality in the translation attribute : Motion(for motion of the
  mousecursor), ResizeWindow, Transparent (to send matching events onwards
  to the next inputarea). 

This release also include number of bug-fixes , and some speed
optimizations to the interpreter.
