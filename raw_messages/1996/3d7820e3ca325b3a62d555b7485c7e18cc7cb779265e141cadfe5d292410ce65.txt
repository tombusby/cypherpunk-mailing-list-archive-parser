I'm did not say that the people sending the messages to "unsubscrive" 
were justified in what they did.  YES, it is written in the welcome 
message.  I just think that maybe we need to be a little tolerant of 
a few people out of 1200 who made an honest mistake.

I still believe that the people sending the messages haven't read 
Tim's "nth Fucking Time" message.  Or his "Under attack by 
foreigners" message.  Or my response about their lack of ignorance.  
(Tim, I just mentioned your messages because they came to mind.  
**GRIN**)  

Steve, I even think that they didn't read your "unsubscrive list" 
message, which I thought was wonderful.

I just think that instead of complaining to the list they're trying 
to remove themselves from, we should send them mail individually.  
I'm sure that Tim already has. (at least he said he did...i think.)

Since I posted yesterday, I have received a nubmer of messages from 
people interested in removing themselves from Cypherpunks.  I sent 
them the paragraph from the welcome message.  And that was that.

Brad
