It's hard to tell the difference between "Assasination 
Politics" and government-sponsored provocateurism, a 
well-documented practice to stigmatize anarchical and 
anti-authoritarian ventures.


However, it takes guts and thick skin to advocate overthrow of 
authority, knowing that reasonable people will think you're a 
nut seeking celebrity martyrdom.


Happily for the careers of agent-and-anarchist back-stabbing 
back-scratchers, there is no easy way to know for sure which is 
which, or even if there's any difference when the media 
juggernauts are provocateuring both roles for melodramatic 
infotainment.
