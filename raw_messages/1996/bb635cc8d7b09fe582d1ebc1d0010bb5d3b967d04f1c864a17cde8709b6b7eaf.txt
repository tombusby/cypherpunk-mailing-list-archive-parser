San Diego Area CPUNKS symposium  Thursday, Feb 29, 1996

   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at "The Mission
Cafe & Coffee Shop" were I hope to get an update of Lance Cottrell's new
anonymous e-mail server, "mixmaster", exchange keys, and discuss other
topical CP stuff.  There might also be an announcement of a new Internet
Service Provider in San Diego providing, among it's other premier services,
anonymous remailers and other privacy services.

   Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint.  If you can figure
out how to get it on the back of a business card, that would be cool.
