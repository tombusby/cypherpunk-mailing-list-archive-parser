It's important to distinguish between what IS the law and what COULD BE 
the law.  And to recall that I at least am not talking here about what 
SHOULD be the law.

It's called "strict liability" -- you are liable when you didn't know.  
The economic justification is that you were in the best position to avoid 
the harm (either by doing some checking, or, in this case (they, not I, 
would say) not offering the service at all.

they are not now, but why couldn't they?  E.g. tell courriers that they 
have a duty not to carry drugs, and must pass all packages by drug 
sniffing dogs?  I don't think that's a good rule, but it's probably 
constitutonal.

No, we are not talking about "should" here.  I, at least, am talking 
about "can they" not "should they".
