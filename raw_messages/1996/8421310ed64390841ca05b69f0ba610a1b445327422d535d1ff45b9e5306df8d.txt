Unfortunately this is not the case.  The perpetrator would
simply have to convince the horny net geeks to pay their own
postage.  In fact, it is *in general* impossible to have both
anonymity and prevention/control of mail-bombing.  Of course 
digital postage will help the problem somewhat by making the
bombers pay for it, and smarter filters on the recipient's end
will help, but in general it is a problem we are going to have
to live with if we want anonymity.
