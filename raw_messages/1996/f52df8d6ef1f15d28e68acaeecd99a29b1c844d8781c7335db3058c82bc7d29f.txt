Cool.  I've got a test message going now.
Does your remailer accept PGP-encrypted email?
It's really critical for high-security applications,
at least for first remailer hops, but your key's not on
the MIT keyserver.

BTW, how do we know you're not a plant?  :-)
Aside from having an interesting nym,
you've probably got the first remailer that
makes it difficult to tell who's running it.
You could be Sameer, or you could be Louis Freeh,
but we don't know.  At least folks like Xenon were
known to be real people....

Even if you _are_ a plant, of course, we can still use
your system, but I'd want to do encrypted email through
other remailers on one end or the other.
