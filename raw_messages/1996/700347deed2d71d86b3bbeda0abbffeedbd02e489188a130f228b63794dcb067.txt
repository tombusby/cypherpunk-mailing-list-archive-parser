You want me to crack your silly cypher?  Goading me with insults won't 
work.  Pay me to.  It'll cost you at least $8000 before I'll even bother 
with it.  and yes I have seen your page. It's supposedly "pseudo code" 
but looks suspiciously like Visual basic.  Learn a real language!

Give me the full cypher source code in C or C++ and a check for $8000 and 
I'll take a look at the holes.  If not, quit pissing on this list.  
Cypherpunks get paid for their work and time.  We don't crack cyphers for 
free.  I recall the last time you offered your company to whoever cracked 
your lame ass cypher - it was cracked, but how come your company still is 
owned by you?  

Nope, goading and insults won't work.  Pay me up front and THEN I'll 
crack your weak stream cypher.
