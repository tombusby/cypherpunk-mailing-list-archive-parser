The flavor of optical amplifier and end equipment being deployed by one 
large telecomm company (ahem) over the next couple of years 
uses 8 colors, each at 2.4 Gbps (OC-48), giving about 20 Gbps,
which is about 10 times the current capacity (1.7 Gbps.)
(Some other telecomm companies are deploying 3-colors of OC-48.)
A nice thing about the optical amplifiers is that they have about triple
the range of the current regenerators, so one amplifier can replace about
16-24 regens,
reducing the amount of equipment that can fail and produce downtime.
Because of this increased capacity, it's a good time to upgrade to SONET rings
(which are dual rings that provide self-healing similar to FDDI's;
SONET self-repair typically takes 60 ms instead of the several minutes
to cross-connect the equivalent pile of T3s using current equipment.)

If the FBI wants to wiretap this stuff, they'll have to get on the ball :-)
