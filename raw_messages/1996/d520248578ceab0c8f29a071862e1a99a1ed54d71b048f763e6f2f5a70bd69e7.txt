What do you mean, "doesn't really fit the facts"?!?  What part of it was 
incorrect?  Fiber-optic _is_ commonly used in inter-office trunks, right?  
It doesn't wear out, right?  Higher usage doesn't entail greater costs, 
right?  The capacity, while not strictly infinite, is high enough so 
expanded usage doesn't strain most links, right?  Finally, modern phone 
switches have sufficient connect capacity so that they can handle usage 
which would have been considered "unusual" by yesteryear's standards.  All 
of this points to an obvious conclusion:  Telephone companies do not, in 
general, have increased costs as a consequence of increased telephone usage.

Here's what I think is _really_ going on:  You have decided that you think 
the costs of the telephone system should be apportioned by usage EVEN IF 
higher usage is no more costly to provide.  That's why you don't want to  
disprove my claims.  You're afraid that you'll have to say, "Yes, you're 
right Jim, but I _still_ think billing should be porportional to use."

Some of whom are probably unnecessary.  Interestingly enough, the rumor is 
that half the costs for LD are in billing and customer service.  Most of 
these costs would disappear if LD was unmetered.

I am confident that local phonecos can remain competitive even against 
"free" Internet telephone service.  What they need to do is simple:  
Entirely remove the LD/local subsidy, remove metering on LD (as well as 
local), bill yearly for far lower costs, etc.  Once this is done, LD will be 
"free", at least on a marginal basis, so no customer will have any 
motivation to move to "Internet telephone" service.

In the US, the current telephone company infrastructure is ALREADY PAID FOR. 
 It was paid for by over-inflated rates during a monopolized era.   If 
anything, the locals have an "unfair advantage" over the rest of the 
companies:  Only they have a copper pair into every home.
