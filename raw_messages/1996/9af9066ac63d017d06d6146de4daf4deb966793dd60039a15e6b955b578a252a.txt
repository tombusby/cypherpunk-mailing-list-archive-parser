That position would be a serious mistake.  Denning knows that she is a 
negative barometer:  Her position will be looked on with contempt by most of 
us.  That, ironically, makes her "useful" to the government should they want 
to sneak one past us.  I think we've already established that this bill 
sucks, although it could become good with major repairs.  Problem is, 
nothing that Denning wants to do to the bill constitutes an improvement, 
except not passing it in the first place!

"Far easier"?  That's an odd statement, because the export of encryption is 
easy with or without restrictive laws.  How much trouble is a "criminal or 
terrorist" going to risk by violating a few measly export laws?  Besides, 
Denning hasn't established that encryption will be any better inside the 
country than without; this means that export controls will have no effect 
even in the most optimistic scenario.

Since when is this news?  Freedom costs.  But it also pays.

Of what significance is the "practised position of our multinational 
corporations"?  They'd sell us out if it preserved THEIR rights.  I'm more 
concerned with the rights of the individual.

Notice that we've already established that this bill in no way produces an 
"unrestriction distribution of encryption technology."  Wish it did, but it 
doesn't.

That's odd.  Most people around here seem to be of the opposite opinion:  
CAPI's seem to be used by the government to justify controls even on 
software that has no encryption capability.

Notice that she seems to be making policy for the government, yet again.

It's only emotional because of malicious and counter-productive efforts by 
government, and government suck-ups like Denning.

I refuse to be used by Denning.  If we make the mistake of supporting this 
bill merely because she claims to oppose it, we would merely be falling into 
her (and the government's) trap.
