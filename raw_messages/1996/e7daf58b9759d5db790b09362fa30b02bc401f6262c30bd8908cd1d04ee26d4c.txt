There was a recent case of a restaurant suing over a bad review that did go
to trial.  The reviewer won.  There has also been litigation against someone
who wrote a letter to a scientific journal attacking someone else.  The
letter writer won.  Of course both the letter writer and the reviewer had
legal costs because they were unwilling to proceed in forma pauperis.
