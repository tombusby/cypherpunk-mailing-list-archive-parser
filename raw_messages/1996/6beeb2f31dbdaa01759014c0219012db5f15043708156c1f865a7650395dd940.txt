Unfortunatly, the law doesn't say that the government _must_ prosecute,
only that it can.

This is not a violation of the Constitution.  The Constitution specifies
that US civil servants (or whatever we intend to call them these days)
cannot be knighted by a foreign country for services rendered to that
country.  So it would be [possibly] illegal for them to have been knighted
by Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, but not illegal (in this instance) for them to
be knighted by England.

You know you've been spending too much time on the computer when your
friend misdates a check, and you suggest adding a "++" to fix it.
