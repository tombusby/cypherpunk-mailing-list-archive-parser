Sorry if this is a repeat - I got a rather
opaque 'delivery failure' message when I 
first sent it. - pt

While I'm reluctant to ever find myself in the same corner as
Vulis, he has a point. As one of the few folks on this list who
actually writes code, I say that hand-optimized assembler will
beat machine generated code every time.

I have figures to back me up.

As some of you know, I've been working on a DES key recovery tool.
I'm have both portable C and x86 assembler versions. They
are currently identical, except that the guts of the DES round is 
written in "C" in one, and hand-optimized Pentium assembler in 
the other. 

For this test, I modified the code to cut out the delays associated 
with incrementing the key schedule (this is not in assembler yet, and
slows down the assembler version about 30%), leaving the of the 
crunching in the DES decryption. Both versions were compiled 
under Visual C++ 4.0, with Optimizations set to 'Maximize speed', 
and inlines to 'any suitable', and run on a 90MHz Digital 
Celebris 590 under WinNT 3.51.

Averaging several runs:

"C":   102,300 crypts/sec
ASM:   238,000 crypts/sec

With Java, it's possible to add native code methods to the 
interpreter, though it requires extra work by the user - 
it's harder than 'click on this link to run my reely 
kool applet'. This violates the Java sandbox, and requires 
the user to  make trust decisions on the methods they 
are adding.

ActiveX lets you add and run native code with a click, but
again involves trust decisions.

My philosophy is 'the more the merrier'. I'd like to see
able to people work on DES Key Recovery on a large number
of platforms and modes - we just need to standardize on 
the input and output formats.
