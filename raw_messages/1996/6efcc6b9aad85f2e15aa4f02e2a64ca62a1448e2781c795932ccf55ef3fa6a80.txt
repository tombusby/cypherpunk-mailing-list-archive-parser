   I think there is NOT a one-to-one mapping of Iranian to Aryan. 
specifically, Farsi'im might be descended from the Aryans, but so are some 
others. Northern Indians, I think?

I have another problem with your statement.  Islam was a gigantic 
watershed in the sociocultural history of Persia. Islamic currents are 
stronger in contemporary Iranian culture, than ancient Aryan influences.
