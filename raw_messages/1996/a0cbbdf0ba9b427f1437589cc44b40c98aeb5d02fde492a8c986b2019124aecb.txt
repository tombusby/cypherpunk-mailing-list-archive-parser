C'punks:

Most who are familiar with the Fed's crypto products are aware that the
NSA categorizes crypto products by "type."  Type I is specified as being
for classified protections (and relying upon classified key) and Type II
being for SBU/other (with unclassified-only key).  I recall, however, that
there were also categories called Type III and Type IV.  I think that Type
III had to do with industry use, with Government-generated key.  Type IV I
can't recall at all.  Now, I can't find the citation where these things
were described.  The EPL cites only Type I & II, Dockmaster has proven of
no use, and the search engines can't find anything on the Net. 

Does anyone recall where a discussion of these types can be found?

TIA.
