On a personal and emotional level I *love* the idea of watching a group of
pro-CDA fundie christers having to sweat in court explaining how their
support for things like incest and murder are protected under the First
Amendment but other people's speech is not. 
 
But on a logical level, should we use (or advocate) the court system under
CDA-related topics. 
 
I think not. 
 
Allen's post has great emotional appeal, but it creates at least one
danger. 
 
The first is the hypocrisy involved in advocating something with which we
disagree, like asking the courts to support CDA and use CDA to punish those
we don't like. 
 
The second is creating an Orwellian doublethink in politics where we first
advocate something, like useing the courts. Then, when challenged (about
hypocrisy or anything else) turn around and state that we really did not
adovate what we so clearly did advocate or that we did not "mean" what we
so clearly said. 
 
Ultimately, we reinforce a form of political behavior where nobody is
responsible for their political behavior and nobody expects to be held
accountable for it. 
 
Witness the behavior of people like Rep. Shroeder who voted for CDA etc.
including the anti-abortion aspects, but does not want this to count among
the pro-choice crowd because she didn't "really" vote for CDA etc. to get
it to limit abortions.
