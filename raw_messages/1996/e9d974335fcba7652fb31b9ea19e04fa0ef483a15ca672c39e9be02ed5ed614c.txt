I am not an electrical engineer and do not play one in real life. However in
my on TEMPEST I heard nothing about varying colors to reduce RF radiation
from a monitor. Just set up a Faraday cage, much simpler.

Better to get TEMPEST rated hardware then... check government surplus...
I've had reports of TEMPEST class computer cases being sold with power
supplies real cheap...

Not that I have ever heard... 

Hopefully I am not feeding this troll too much.

No modern equipment can detect radiation that does NOT leave a Faraday cage.
