	Replace "mafia" with government, and "money" with power/control.

	Who says a _new_ morality? Maybe it is just a wider expresion of
an already extant morality. If you will accept the defination of Murder
being "immoral killing", then most people really don't have a problem
with killing. They just draw the line between murder and killing in
different places. To me, killing is justified in 2 circumstances. 1) If
the [man animal]s threat potential exceeds a certain limit (variable) or
2) food/warmth is needed and will be derived from said killing. To kill
randomly or indiscrimantely, wether man or animal is Murder (i.e. immoral
killing) to me this _does_ include trophy hunting, but not if you utilize
the animal for food etc.
	Where humans are concerned, killing them for food is rarely an
issue, but they often present some sort of threat potential. Certain
pepole in government approach this threat potential. Thus, to me, killing
them isn't immoral, but it could _legally_ (i.e. a different defination)
be murder. 

	As far as I am concerned there really is no difference between the
government and the mafia. Both use the same threat to accomplish their
ends, the Mafia is just more honest about it. Both suck. Out loud. The
mafia just tends to be better run, and less invasive personally until you
violate their rules.

	Why do you need new technology? The old stuff works just great.
You just need the new stuff to hide you from the feds.

	I am getting the impression that this last sentence was a little
sarcastic?
