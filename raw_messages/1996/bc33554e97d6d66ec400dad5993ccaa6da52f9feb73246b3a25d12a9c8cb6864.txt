Unicorn will do.  The nym, for those interested, is taken from our 
crest.  Dirsec, the username for a time, was a result of some ISP account 
shuffling.  Completely outside my control I fear.  I don't think anyone 
calls me by my name on the list, but I could be mistaken.

Again, Unicorn, or uni will do.  When I adopted the nym, I never planned 
it to be a long term thing.  I'm sure I would have been more obscure had 
I given it much thought.

I'm not liberal enough to be offended by the color/evil implication of my 
nym.  The blazon of the black unicorn has been with my family a long 
time.  I'd hardly consider it an offense, though I understand the 
caution.
