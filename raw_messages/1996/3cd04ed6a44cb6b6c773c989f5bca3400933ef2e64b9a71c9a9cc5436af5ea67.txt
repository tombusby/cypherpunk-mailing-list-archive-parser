I think this is the crux of the problem - they are simply misnaming
their proprietry algorithm.

I don't see any stigma attached with IPG admitting they have a PRNG
seeded with a key, and XORing the PRNG stream with the data - this is
exactly what RC4 does.  But of course RC4 (now) has the advantage of
open review, and before that it had the advantage of Ron Rivests
reputation associated with it.  Simply change all the literature to
replace "OTP" with "PRNG", or "seed" in appropriate places.

So, submitting your PRNG for open peer review would be a good start.
But I don't think the fact that IPG generates the keys for their
clients is good.  I don't see this as a viable key distribution
mechanism.

But you *really* must stop equating your system with a one time pad,
it absolutely is NOT a OTP.

exactly.

I do hope IPG will take the trouble to consider comments such as this,
and Perrys comments above, if they are at all serious about their
system every gaining any reputation.
