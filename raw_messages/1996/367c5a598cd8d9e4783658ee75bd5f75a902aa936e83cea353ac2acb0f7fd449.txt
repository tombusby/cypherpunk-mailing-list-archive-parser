Not at all.  (Did you mean sarcastic?)  His staff are some of the most
astute people on the hill technologically.  That their view might tend to
the statist side disturbs me, but I wasn't talking about their politics.
On the hill a competent and fairly reasonable enemy is much less a problem
than an incompetent publicity seeker.

I remember, I was sitting at the hearings.

One should bear in mind that it was Specter who pushed for hearings
originally, and Specter who was giving with one hand and taking with the
other all through the process.  I won't say I'm happy with Leahy for the
legislation, but that doesn't change the fact that he has a clue.  In my
view the legislation would have been much worse and Clipper more imposing
had Leahy not been involved.

Mind you, I never said Leahy was a giant in the movement for crypto and
privacy interests, just that I was glad someone had a clue.

Agreed.

Again, I never called him a friend, but I still submit to you, that his
influence in the legislative process blunted some of the highly offensive
positions.  Sometimes you have to expect legislators to make compromises.
It's a fact of the "democratic process" that Mr. Loomis is so very fond
of.  The result is that to gain influence over a given area of legislative
intent and effort, you sometimes have to sleep with whores (and
occasionally they have VD).
