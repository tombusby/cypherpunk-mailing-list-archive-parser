Has any work been done (yet) using the recently-publicised techniques
used to foil smart card tamperproofing against Clipper implementations?

Seems like it's a bit of a different story, since in the Clipper's
case the algorithm is (ostensibly) unknown, but I'm just curious as
to whether there is some compromise of its security-through-obscurity.
