	The courts are also (sensibly) seeing zoning laws attempting to outlaw
such small dishes as being completely ridiculous.

	I've gone even farther than that - I don't bother with having a TV, I
just get my info from the net. There is the problem with the satellite net
links that it tends to concentrate data production & distribution into
relatively few hands, from which it can easier be taken by government and other
forces. Larger corporation, despite the influence their size gives them, can
be easier to pressure than the small ones. Look at Compuserve in Germany, for
instance - they were having pressure from Christian Coalition types, etcetera,
and used the German investigation as an excuse.
	On the other hand, this is also a very good argument against rural
subsidies being necessary - if people want net access and are educated and
smart enough to afford it (and thus be able to use it properly), they can get
it even if they're in the wilds of Montana.
