 Or, get to Stanford's Campus Drive via 280-Sand Hill or 101-El Camino
 Real-Embarcadero. From 280, take Campus Drive left (clockwise). From 101,
 take Campus Drive right (counterclockwise). Turn South (centripetal) at
 Panama Street and take an immediate left into the Jordan Quad parking lot
 (empty on weekends). Walk between Pine and Redwood Halls to Polya. 
 Turing is between Polya and Cypress. It doesn't appear on most campus
 maps, but it's there, honest. Entrance to Turing Auditorium is by the
 Pac Bell payphone sign.

Notes:
  The short notice is my fault, I was hoping to get some folks to talk
at the meeting and waited far too long to give up on them.

Thanks:
  Much thanks to Rich Graves and the Stanford PGP Club for the wonderful
meeting space.
