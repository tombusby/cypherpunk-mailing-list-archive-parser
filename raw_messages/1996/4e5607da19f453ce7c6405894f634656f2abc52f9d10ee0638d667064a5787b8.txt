As far as I know, the 1st amendment to the US Constitution is there to 
protect unpopular, as well as popular, speech.  And while it may be a 
surprise to you, my kind of speech is getting far more popular and has been 
for the last few years.  Much of the reason for this has been the 
abusiveness that you describe but don't seem to try to do anything about.

In any case, the "clear and present danger" standard to speech such as mine 
is not satisfied.  Nobody is under the illusion that anybody else is going 
to rush right out and kill someone as a consequence of my comments.  It is, 
therefore, protected speech.  (Not that I really have much respect for the 
distinction, anyway.  The issue is, is there some OFFICIAL distinction, and 
there apparently is.)

Since you keep inventing these straw men and knocking them down, it is 
really questionable whether you have any kind of good judgment as to who is 
"clearly complicit in the destruction of material evidence."

It would be far more effective and credible if you would at least admit that 
not every action by a third party which has the effect of frustrating some 
court is actionable.  The simple action of FAILING to store information that 
may later be wanted by the officials is an excellent example, for instance.

Naturally, you won't like this either.  And you certainly won't want to rise to my challenge and draw a distinct line, because that would put you to your proof, and you have none.

What?!?  you don't have a better response to this?

Well, you're trying to change the subject.  It's "escrow agents."  And the 
question is, "must an escrow agent always know the identity of the people 
for whom the information is kept."  The simple answer, invoking existing 
software technology, is, "no."  

So now you need to explain why courts are going to be able to force a 
third-party to give what he doesn't know he has, and in fact nobody else 
knows either.  You'll fail at this task, of course, because the answer is 
not politically correct by your standards.

A position which fails to do anything about the current problems in society. 
 Show me that my solution is worse than the status quo, and you'll have a 
point.  Until then, you're just a complainer.

Still sloppy.  Classic Unicorn.

I take great pains and give them to others.  

Anyway the reason suicide is a 
silly option is that it assumes that the problem lies with me, not others.  
Obviously, other people are complaining about the same situation, so the 
problem is not my fault.  But I'm hoping to be part of the solution.

You REALLY won't like this!

There are not ONLY "two ways around it."  There are also clearly "ways that 
Unicorn likes" and "ways Unicorn doesn't like."  It is possible that if they 
were studied carefully a person would discover that (warning!  Set theory 
terms coming up!) intersection between the two groups, "Ways that work" and 
"ways that Unicorn likes" is zero.  As if by design.

I've never encouraged "random murder."  Quite the opposite:  It would be far 
more accurate to say that I encourage VERY SELECTIVE killing.  It is not, 
however, GOVERNMENT SPONSORED killing, which is why you won't like it.
