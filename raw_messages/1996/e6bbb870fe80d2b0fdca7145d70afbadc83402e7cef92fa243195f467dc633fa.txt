Ever wonder that a random number device driver or hardware will have a subtle 
flaw???

Relying on the /dev/random NOISE.SYS driver now while it's still in beta 
isn't nec. a good idea.  For experimentation, sure.  I'm also rather
concerned as to how this version of PGP handles it.  Very much so.

The current and latter versions of NOISE.SYS parallels the Linux random.c 
driver in that there are two devices, /dev/random and /dev/urandom... the 
older versions (pre version 0.4) will return as many bytes as are requested 
(from /dev/random) whereas the current version returns only as many bytes as 
are conservatively estimated to be "truly random".

If you are using the older NOISE.SYS /dev/random or the newer version's 
/dev/urandom for key generation then essentially you're using a pseudo-RNG 
based on SHA rather than real random data.

The implementation should try to get as many bits as are needed from the 
driver and then request some keystrokes, collect more data, etc. until you 
have enough bits (advantage over older PGP method? You only need to sample 
from driver, and not worry about processing raw samples yourself; driver also 
samples from other sources than keystrokes as well...)

I'd be wary of relying on NOISE.SYS or any similar driver for PGP-key 
generation until the driver gets more thorough examination; I'd also be VERY 
wary of an improper use of the driver.
