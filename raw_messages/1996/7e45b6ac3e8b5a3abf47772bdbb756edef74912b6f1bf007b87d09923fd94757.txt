In fact, Perrygrams are dead because I've given up on this list.
There is no more cryptography discussion going on -- the list is
basically a very low grade political rant forum, with most of the
rants having no relevance to crypto.

(I suppose "I told you so" doesn't help much.)

Anyway, as soon as I find a home for Cypherpunks Mark II I'm starting
it and unsubscribing from here. Cypherpunks is dead. This happens to
all mailing lists eventually. I suppose it had to happen here.

(Finding a new list home has been a low priority project for me
recently because I've been busy with "real work" -- however, if you
run (I emphasize *run*) a well connected site and can handle a list
with 1500 subscribers or so, and don't mind a somewhat more
restrictive charter than "post anything you like at any time", please
get in touch.)
