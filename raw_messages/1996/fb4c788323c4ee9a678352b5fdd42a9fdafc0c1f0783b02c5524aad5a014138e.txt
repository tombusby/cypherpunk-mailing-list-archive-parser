Undeniably true. I think Tim's point was more, "Who cares?  Everyone *I*
want to talk to speaks English."

One may quibble with the wisdom or morality of such a statement, but if
the second statement is true in your case, then there is no reason you
should have to learn another language. Most upper-income Americans have no
need for esoteric languages. Almost all upper-income Americans have a need
for English.

For example, *I* only really need to speak English, TCP, Spanish, HTML,
AppleTalk, and occasionally French and Perl. Most of the time, I have no
need to know C++, IPX, Tagalog, higher mathematics, German, or Java; I've
got "people" for that.  I'm probably wrong to put my faith in y'all to
write the code I use, but hey, we can't all do everything. I don't write
crypto code, and I don't haul my trash to the dump or tend to the
landscaping around my apartment. Why should I?

Then again, I do find it worthwile to be on the cypherpunks list, and I
will say hola to the gardener.
