	While this is certainly your business, I would suggest at least
one physical a year, including blood work, as a good preventative measure...
I believe it _has_ been shown to extend lives; I can do a Medline lookup if
desired.

	Actually, the major subsidy appears to be that employer-paid
health insurance isn't a taxable benefit. The status regarding self-insured
persons such as you is constantly changing, but they're looking at subsidizing
that also. Essentially, taxes paid by those with low or no employer-paid
health insurance are subsidizing those with high-cost employer-paid health
insurance.
