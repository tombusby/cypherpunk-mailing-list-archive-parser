This is hardly news.  An old and inconsequential distinction
unfortunately.

"Right to choose to be in contempt of court" ?  If only I could attach a
sound file with my howling laughter to this post.

Do not make the mistake of thinking there is no case law on wiretap simply
because you have not/are too lazy to go to the library and look it up.

Tried and failed decades ago.

Again, you're late.  Several years too late.

You propose to refight a case soundly resolved ages ago and you propose to
get the rest of the list to do your homework for you.

I propose you go to the library and do your own work for a change.

I wonder what caused you to think this was some kind of novel revelation.

I know you think you're being very clever and original, as if somehow you
aquired the skills of a noted constitutional scholar whilest no one was
looking. I also know that you have not bothered to research your own
claims.  I can't decide, however, if this is cleverness on your part in
trying to get someone else to do all your work for you, in which case it's
not working on me, or simple laziness, in which case it's apparent and
unsurprising.
