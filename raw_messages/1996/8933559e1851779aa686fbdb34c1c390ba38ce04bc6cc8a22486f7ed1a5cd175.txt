I followed the links and explored the web site of the "address verification"
provider ( http://www.abii.com ). The data they have about me is outdated
(by at least a year) and apparently derived from a phone book or directory
assistance. 

I picked up a copy of "The Net" magazine at the store tonight because it's
got an article listing several of these Web-accessible address/phone
databases. The article doesn't say anything especially fascinating but it
does list three such sites:

http://www.searchamerica.com/
http://www.switchboard.com/
