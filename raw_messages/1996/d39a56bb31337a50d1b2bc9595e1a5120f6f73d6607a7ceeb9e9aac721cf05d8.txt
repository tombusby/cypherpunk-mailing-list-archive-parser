Right! 10,000 volts is always fatal.

In fact, I died many times during my high school days, playing with 20,000
volt neon sign transformers, 100,000 volt Tesla coils, and (gasp) 250,000
volt Van de Graaf generators. (By the way, the neon sign transformer was
actually pretty dangerous, and my handling of it was careless, I now see.
Be careful when you convert one of these into a Jacob's Ladder, or use it
for plasma studies.)

However, maybe the a.c. nature of some of these voltage sources revived me
on the "reverse" cycle. (The V.D.G. is not a.c....so this blows this
theory.)
