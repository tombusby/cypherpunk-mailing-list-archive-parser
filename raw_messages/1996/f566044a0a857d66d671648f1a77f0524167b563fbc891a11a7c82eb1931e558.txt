Agreed.  You don't even have to read the newsgroup or the web page - just 
search for "John Young" or "Ed Carp", and in a few seconds read 
everything your detractors have been saying about you anywhere on the 
net.  Then all it takes is one phone call to your lawyer.

"Past the wounds of childhood, past the fallen dreams and the broken families,
through the hurt and the loss and the agony only the night ever hears, is a
waiting soul.  Patient, permanent, abundant, it opens its infinite heart and
asks only one thing of you ... 'Remember who it is you really are.'"
