Well, this one has a grain of truth in it, but has drifted a bit in the telling.

>From <alt.folklore.urban>'s FAQ:

T. *Indiana House Bill #246 of 1897 would've set pi=3.2. Killed in state Senate.

Fb. Some state (e.g., KS, OK, etc.) once considered a bill setting pi = 3
(or some other arbitrary, non-transcendental number).

Key to Listed FAQs:
T  = 100% scientific truth
Tb = believed true, but not conclusively proven
F  = 100% falsehood
Ft = A legend, mostly untrue, but with a true occurrence or known origin.
Fb = believed false, but not conclusively proven

there is further information on this point available via anonymous ftp.
See the AFU anonymous ftp sites noted in Part I of the FAQ for more
