I would.  If you look at who has the oppertunities to go college you will
note that those who are good at taking tests (SAT, ACT, or IQ) are those
who get to go.  You will also note that money also breeds success, or can
someone give me an argument for the fact that there are more rich kids
going to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and the like than poor kids. (These
schools almost gaurentee success.)

If you want to find a correlation look for it in money not tests.  And if
you are insistant on finding it in tests, ask why the scores are as they
are (was the test written to the advantage of one group over another or can
one group buy the "A" with special courses which teach the skills needed to
score high.)
