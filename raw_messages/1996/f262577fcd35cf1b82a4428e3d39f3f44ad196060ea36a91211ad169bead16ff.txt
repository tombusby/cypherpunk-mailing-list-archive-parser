Seems the demise of PGP in favor of S/MIME has been somewhat exaggerated.
Blurb in this week's InfoWorld led me to
http://www.ftp.com/mkt_info/onnet32/tr-pgp.htm

It would be a mistake, though, to say that they have a clue:

  E-mail compatibility

     Most e-mail systems can send and receive only plain text (technically,
     7-bit ASCII characters). So PGP converts the encrypted information
     (which is 8-bit) into plain ASCII text using the radix-64 algorithm.

     This has a side effect that enhances security even when you don't use
     encryption. If you merely add authentication to the message, radix-64
     still converts the whole message using its own algorithm. The resulting
     message -- even though it's not securely encrypted -- looks garbled to
     the casual snoop.

D'Oh!
