Your not dissapointed?

Ok.  I now have a link from my main page to a page with my policy.

What I said (or meant to) was that MY LAWYER SAID IT WAS ILLEGAL IN 
ANGUILLA.  

In my first post I quoted the wrong part and said "this is fraud by
taxbomber - he did sell fake passports".  I meant to quote a part
where he said something like "I never sold fake passports".

It may be covered in the anti-fraud sections of the laws.

He got a little warning, then only web access was cut off.  And I forwarded
his email and was the nameserver for his domain name so that he could move
right away to another site.  Then he sent a message to the Internic to
move the management of his domain to another site.

Understood.

Not saying that is fraud.  The most I said was encouraging fraud.  It
has been pointed out that under common law using another name is not 
fraud.  However, under certain countries laws using a fake passport
to open a bank account may be defined as fraud.

It is both a lesson to be learned, and part of the overall situation.

Sure.  And you can run your offshore services as you wish.  I like mine
better.  :-)

If selling fake passports is illegal in Anguilla, and the US has freedom
of speech, they are not comparable.
