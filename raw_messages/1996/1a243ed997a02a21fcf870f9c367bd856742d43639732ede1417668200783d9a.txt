I think that the original poster meant twiddling some of the (relatively)
unused fields of the header which most routers and applications do not
care about, the type-of-service field or priority would good place to
start.  This would have no effect on the data in the packet, particularly
if you fiddle at the IP level instead of TCP.  While it is a low
bandwidth comm channel, it has a couple of advantages which you seem to
overlook:

        -It can be applied by two routers which are in the middle
         of the connection.  The two endpoints of the TCP/IP
         connection would not even notice.  For example, if I control
         a router "upstream" of a major connection point and the
         site I wish to communicate with is in a similar position
         then I can run the subliminal channel in a "spread spectrum"
         mode across many connections and the packets can get reset
         to their original settings by the other site. The user
         whose stream we fiddled with does not even know that they
         were used as carrier wave...

        -While the per-packet information rate is low, such a system
         has a _lot_ of packets to work with and a much larger choice
         of endpoints.  Your hypothetical .WAV file may pack more
         information in, but there are a miniscule amount of such files
         moving on the Internet; just by transmitting such a file you
         could be suspect (honestly, how many soundfiles do you think
         you could ship around before people get suspicious...)  By
         hiding the information in the lower layers of TCP/IP you also
         make it less likely to be noticed; unless someone hooks up a
         packet sniffer and filters at the IP level the stream will
         go unnoticed, while a soundfile is an application-level
         communication and much easier to watch.  It is, in effect,
         hiding the channel in the low-order bits of the comm channel
         used to transmit your soundfile...

        -An application encoding method (pictures,soundfiles, etc.)
         also needs a "reason" for being sent.  You can legitimately
         send packets for no reason whatsoever, at least from the users
         perspective (e.g. DNS lookups, ICMP messages, faked fragments,
         etc.)  A packet system also has a constant stream of traffic to
         play with; you could run TCP/IP _on top of such a system_!
         Passing soundfiles and images back and forth would not work
         for interactive communication, it is UUCP at best.
