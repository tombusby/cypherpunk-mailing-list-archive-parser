Absitively, posilutely yes.

But it's going to be a political/bureaucratic decision made by people
without Net access or knowledge, which means it will take time. I don't 
think any more provocation is necessary. Right now, the press even in 
Germany is inclined to see us as the good guys. Every reader of 
alt.censorship, soc.culture.german. alt.revisionism, and a number of 
other groups has known how to access Zundel's writings from inside 
Germany for two days. I submit that no further penetration is necessary.

Yup.

But Zundel and other Nazis now quote this too, which I find rather
offensive.  It's a battle over who owns the symbols, in part. OK, probably
nobody should own symbols or rhetorical devices.

No, it's much worse.

They are calling on their followers to establish "censorship-free zones"
at major universities. They don't even acknowledge that this was done days
ago. And they know --- one of the guys who is now calling for mirror 
sites, and totally shunning me, is the person who uploaded Zundel's files 
to my server.

They are calling major newspapers in several countries, and Time 
Magazine, proclaiming their "censorship-free zone" strategy.

They are more organized and media-savvy than I am. They are professional 
liars; "we" are not.

I do not expect these news outlets to bother to, or know how to, check
whether mirror sites had already popped up before these "demands." I do
not expect these news outlets to find out and publicize the fact that it 
was a couple of cypherpunks who detest Mr. Zundel who came up with the 
idea the afternoon of January 27th, and handed it to Zundel the next day.
