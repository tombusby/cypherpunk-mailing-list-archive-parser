At most, they might be privately directed to the appropriate URL or 
other reference.  Some take the time to answer such questions by 
providing an exercise which should lead the individual to the answer.  

Chances are, though, that they're perfectly aware of Schneir's book 
and numerous other FAQ's of relevance.  That means most likely we're 
dealing with laziness - which does not deserve a response

I believe that's called "learning."  Unfortunately, far too many 
people engage in what I call "willful ignroance."   

I'm not an engineer.  I'm not a mathmetician.  I don't fully 
understand everything I've read here.  If I'm interested, however, I 
look further and read up on the subject so I can make informed 
queries if needed.

Some seem to think that this list is cruel to newcomers by posting 
sarcastic responses to newbie inquiries.  This list assumes some 
amount of prior knowledge on the part of it's members.  It is not the 
place for "what does PGP stand for?" questions.
