I couldn't find any mention of either filename in -our- docs.
Please point out the reference if I missed it. I think this was
an MIT "feature". I don't plan to copy it.

Not as useful as you might think. A bug has been reported in the
MIT version that +makerandom produces -weak- pseudo-random
output, as (I am told) can be verified by just generating a large
"random" file and viewing it with a hex viewer, looking for
regular patterns. I don't know if this was ever fixed in Stale's
version. This bug does not produce a weakness in the normal
functions of MIT or Stale's PGP.

MIT heavily rewrote the random number functions for their
versions of PGP and the +makerandom feature depends on this
rewrite. I did not want to try to import "mass quantities" of
code from MIT both to respect their copyright and to maintain to
some degree the independence of the MIT-derived and 2.3a-derived
versions to that a bug in one might not be reproduced in the
other.

For Random numbers up to 24 bytes (192 bits), just use a -copy-
of RANDSEED.BIN.

For a longer random file, just encrypt (either RSA or
conventional IDEA) a file a little longer than the file desired.
Throw away a few hundred bytes from the start and end. The result
will be just as strongly random as +makerandom even without the
current bug.

I haven't tried to imlpement the "Charset" header and probably
won't. If this feature is important to you, use Stale's version.
I will look into this for the next version, but no promises.

Clearsig is working correctly as we document it. Another MIT
change. It would be more work to change the documentation than
the code, but I will consider this for the next release.

Thanks for your constructive criticism and comments.
