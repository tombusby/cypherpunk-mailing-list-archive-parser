	Understandable.

	What are the exceptions?

	I kind of knew that already... as should others.

	A good point... although if it hasn't been proven whether something is
stolen (e.g., an encrypted piece of data sent to the attorney), I would hope
that privilege would still obtain. Of course, there would be the question
(also important for First Amendment issues) of whether information that the
recipient can't understand is communication.

	A good question. Of course, again there's the point of what if the
attorney has investigated the matter and decided that no crime is being
committed, but that the material should be destroyed because it could be
embarrasing, lead to other problems (e.g., civil lawsuits), etcetera. If a
court later decides that the attorney was wrong, would privilege still obtain,
and would the attorney be a co-conspirator? I would hope the answers would be
yes and no.

	The P.O. box signed up in the name of the nym would be a problem,
however, given the current laws on ID necessary for this. Of course, this
assumes not using fake ID (including that of a fictitious employer). I've
gotten a couple of P.O. boxes in my own name recently (not wanting to disclose
my current address), and they did want a couple pieces of ID. I should check
what ID they will accept.
