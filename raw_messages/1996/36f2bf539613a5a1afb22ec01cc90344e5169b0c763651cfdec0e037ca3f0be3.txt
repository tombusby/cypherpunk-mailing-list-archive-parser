This is surely a reasonable statement for Esther to have made, even though
connotatively it may seem to have an anti-anonymity thrust to it. Who can
dispute that individual freedom (of any sort) entails the potential that
someone will use that freedom badly, and that the greater the freedom the
greater the theoretical potential for harm?

The civil-libertarian argument can't be any naive denial of this sort of
analysis -- instead, it has to something that acknowledges the truth of the
principle, yet simultaneously denies the inference that the principle,
standing alone, amounts to a case for limiting that freedom. One way to do
so is to argue  that the theoretical threat is outweighed by the benefits
both to society and to individuals. Another is to point out that there
seems to be no evidence that the theoretical problem has transmuted itself
into a real one.

You may feel free to forward this.
