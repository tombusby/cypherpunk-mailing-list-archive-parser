Part of the reason past Clipper schemes haven't been deployed is because they  
had been shown not to work!  I say if there are weak spots, keep punching  
holes in them.  While Washington is spinning around trying to come up with a  
new-and-improved version, keep deploying good strong crypto and working the  
free-speech/civil-liberties angle in the courts.  By the GAKers come up with a  
workable solution (which is probably impossible given the politics involved  
in global-GAK) it will be too late.
