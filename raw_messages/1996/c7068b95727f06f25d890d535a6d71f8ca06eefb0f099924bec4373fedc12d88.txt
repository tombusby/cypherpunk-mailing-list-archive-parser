Hmmmm...   Unlawful email bomb?   My understanding is that the entire problem
of spaming, which you reportedly enage in (and admitted such in another
message),  is at best a grey area.  Otherwise you'd probably be needing that
legal department to defend yourself.

I'd suggest you read up on the concept of a mailing list.  
cyperpunks@toad.com is one of those.   If you send a message there, it'll
reach all 1400 people who've actually signed up (note the difference from
spamming? They *requested* it!).   To me it looks like you got subscribed.   
send a message to majordomo@toad.com with the text of "unsubscribe
cypherpunks" and you'll be removed.   Speaking of which, remove me from the
list you mentioned in your other message....

Really?   I must have missed the E-Mail Regulations Act of 1996 . . . 
Speaking of which, 
Reply-to:	adamsc@io-online.com (Chris Adams)
must be a valid address; your inane message reached me, right?

Hmmmm...  The message I sent to the list actually got distributed to the
list.  That majordomo thingie must work, after all...
