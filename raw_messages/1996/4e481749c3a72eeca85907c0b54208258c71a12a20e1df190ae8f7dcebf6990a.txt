This is not an idle threat.  When Pierre Trudeau was elected prime minister
of Canada (1969?) there was some scrambling in the US to get him off the
_persona non grata_ list.  Seems that in his student days he had been busted
for trying to kayak from Florida to Cuba.  Canadian author Farley Mowatt
(sp?) was turned back at the border for imagined pinko associations (best
guess was that it was because he had traveled to the USSR to research _Sibir_).

Such a blacklisting would really hurt me in my current job.  I made about 15
business trips to the US (from Canada) last year.

That makes no sense.  "Country Y would pass a law saying that country X may
bar you for something country X doesn't like"??  That's unnecessary on two
counts: Country Y has no jurisdiction in X, and X doesn't need Y permission
anyway.  Example, so called "sex tourist" from western countries travel to
the far east to have sex with minors.  You can't do it back home, but there
nothing to stop you from doing it abroad.  Or if you want an example closer
to home, how about Californians traveling to Nevada to gamble?
