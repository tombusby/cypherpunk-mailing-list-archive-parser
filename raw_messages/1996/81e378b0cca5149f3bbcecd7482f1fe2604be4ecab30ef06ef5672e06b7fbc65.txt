My commentary below supposes that the robbers are _not_ cypherpunks,
but are fanatic logicians, and prefer poverty to death.
It also assumes that all motions are non-debatable,
which reduces the amount of dealmaking possible.

Wrong.  If 16 gets killed, 18 knows that 17 and 20 will probably 
split the money, so it's in 18's interest to team with 16 and 19.

15, 17, and 20 can also vote to split the money.

14's position is a bit shakier, but he's got more people to deal with.
