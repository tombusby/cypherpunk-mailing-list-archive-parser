Keeping a client's secrets happens to be an ethical and legal requirement of
the legal profession.  It used also to be a requirement of the medical and
banking professions.  If it is good for lawyers to keep secrets why not
doctors and banks?

So we can retain the ability to say 'fuck you Jack' to fascist bastards such
as yourself.

The definition of a totalitarian is one who wants total involvement in and
control of the lives of those he rules.  We're just trying to keep you and
all the world's rulers from becoming totalitarians.  Quite a public service.
Our fathers used heavy artillery and bombers rather than offshore bank
secrecy to discourage totalitarianism.  Pretty mild of us.
