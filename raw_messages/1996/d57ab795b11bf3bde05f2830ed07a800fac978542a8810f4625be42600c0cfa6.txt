It won't be worthwhile for a year or two for spam artists to go to the
trouble of figuring out how to do this.  I'm not sure I have a good
solution to this problem in the long term, however.

If our custom was to send money to people who make good posts, then
you could imagine the fee being quite high, say $20, since most of
the money will be made back.  Voila! We have a wonderful feedback
system for how much contribution we have made.

People who want to make sure that they are putting in at least as
much as they take out can make a little rule for themselves: I won't
take money out of my cypherpunks e-cash account.  I will only
send it to other people for their good posts.  In effect, this is
a fully distributed tokening system without the choke point of
a single token administrator.

I agree that we should keep it sweet and simple.  That's one nice
aspect of the e-cash scheme.  All the software is already out there,
except (maybe) the majordomo part which I have volunteered to do.

Keep in mind that if the list brings in, say, $1000/month that buys
a lot of food.  I have to think that this will liven up the
monthly meetings and create many positive and lasting relationships.

This is exactly the sort of process which is facilitated by paying
a dollar.  In your case it won't make a difference, but most people
will find their presence on the list becomes much more responsible
when they have to put up a buck.
