No. Line-items refer to budgetary allocations.  If it were part of a 
budget bill that allocated monies, then a line-item veto could zap it.

Those folks really *don't* want a line-item veto now that a different 
party could use it.  I doubt it would ever be more than a rhetorical tool 
since it would limit the allocated pork... even be used as a form of 
political blackmail.

ObCrypto: None.
