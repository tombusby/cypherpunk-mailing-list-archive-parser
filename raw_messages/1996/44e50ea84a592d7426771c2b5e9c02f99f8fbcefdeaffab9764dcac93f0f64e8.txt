I don't think this issue is as simple as Friedman wants to make it sound.
(Then again, he may have been quoted out of context.) In any event, what he
said is true, modulo explicit or implicit contracts to the contrary, rules
about union activity, common-law privacy rights, Title VII, the ECPA and
similar state statutes, and so forth. The quote sounds like a self-serving
statement intended to scare people into believing that their rights are as
limited as the speaker wishes they were. That's not so unusual, but it's not
always useful to get legal advice from someone who sees their interests as
adverse to yours.

(We've gone over the "I think the law regarding employers rights vis-a-vis
employees rights *should* be 'x'" ground a zillion times, and another rehash
seems unproductive. I don't intend to respond to messages along those lines.)
