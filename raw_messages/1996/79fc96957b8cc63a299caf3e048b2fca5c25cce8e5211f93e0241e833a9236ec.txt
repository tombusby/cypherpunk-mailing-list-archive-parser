There is an extensive survey at the European Cryptography Resources page,
http://www.modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~avs/eu-crypto.html

The EU commission's group DG XIII has been discussing key escrow for quite
some time, but they have not yet been able to agree on a position.
Jerome Thorel has posted some rather scaring interviews with EU official
David Herson who is in favor of a key esrow scheme. Victor Mayer-Schoenfelder
reports that crpyo regulation is likely to be delegated to the more liberal
DG XV.

A number of member states, such as Denmark, very unlikely to accept key
escrow.

Ross Anderson has analyzed Mitchell's scheme, drawing the conclusion that
"The GCHQ protocal is very poorly engineered." See

The final decision will almost certainly with the member states, because
cryptography is considered essential for national security.
