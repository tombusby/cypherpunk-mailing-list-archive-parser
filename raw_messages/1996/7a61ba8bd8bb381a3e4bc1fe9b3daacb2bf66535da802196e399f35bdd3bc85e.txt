Clickshare launches Internet's first multi-site micropayments service
"Internet Information Utility" delivers commerce a la carte

        WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., Sept. 16  --  Clickshare Corporation's
pioneering multi-site, single-ID, Internet micropayment system went live on
Friday as users began clicking on -- and paying for -- information online.
Purchases from Friday to Sunday by over a dozen first registrants totaled
$62.60.

        "We're the web's first working multi-site distributed
user-management and micropayment service," said Bill Densmore, Clickshare's
chairman. "Now publishers can charge for valuable information on the
Internet, rather than giving it away."

       "Now that 'The Internet's Information Utility' (sm)  is up and
running," said Felix Kramer, Clickshare marketing director, "we'll finally
see whether people will buy information by the click."
