	I FTP'ed middleman from hacktic and have placed it in the noexport
directory on the anonymous FTP site at ftp.jpunix.com. Since it contains a
copy of Mixmaster with the crypto-code intact, the instructions for
downloading mixmaster also apply to middleman. You can find it in the same
hidden directory as mixmaster.
