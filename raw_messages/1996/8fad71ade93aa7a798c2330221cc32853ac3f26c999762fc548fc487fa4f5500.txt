First of all I support John's decision.

However, these types of actions make it difficult to further any 
common carrier legal development.  As most on the list will agree, we 
would like certain content freedom on the Net.  When the SPA 
discussed thier contributory infringement we all cringed (especially 
those running small ISPs).

My point is that this decision should be based upon anything but 
content.  Arguments can be made that the Dr. "asked" to be removed by 
techincal means.  Arguments can be made that the Doctor abused 
remailers (assuming a writing analysis can identify him and that 
"abused" has any definition 8-).  Saying that the Doctor was 
decreasing the S/N ratio IS content based restriction.  It DOES open 
up the door.

While I wish he was wrong, I have to agree.

That is not completely true in the USA.  Content can and is 
restrained.  You cant yell "FIRE" in a crowded theatre.  Commercial 
speech is restrained.  And, yes, sexually explicit language used on a 
jobsite is effectively restrained (I am a discrimination lawyer, 
believe me, it is).

All of the "advertisements" and their "extent" are totally 
irrelevant.  John does not advertise.  Members might.  So what?  Am I 
to understand that if I get enough people to tell others that my 
favorite privately held company is really a public one that I can 
then have a court force them to make an IPO?  It is private, it is 
controlled by John, not the government (unless that white van outside 
his house is actually filtering his packets 8-).

Very happy to volunteer my services.
