Actually, the lesson to be learned is that the news media is filled with a 
bunch of hypocrites.  These people are supposed to be REPORTERS, for god's 
sake.  Are they trying to tell us that they've never gone to the DMV and 
forked over $4 to find out the owner of a car?  Can you say, "investigative 
reporting"?

I think they're just carrying water for their friends who work for government.

While I think that the information should be disseminated on the net 
REGARDLESS of whether "it's legal" in any particular jurisdiction.  Or, 
perhaps more accurately, I think that this information shouldn't be 
collected at all.  Then it couldn't be abused.
