I think he meant that it might cost him several $10000 in computing time to
actually demonstrate a flaw, should it be found. Proving the flaw exists
should be enough. If a company really needs unbreakable encryption, a few
hundred thou isn't too much for an attacker to pay for million dollar secrets.
On the other hand, it would be quite a bit for an individual to come up with,
just to illustrate a point.

And this thing about keeping a copy of the one-time-pad, now just why is it
that you need to at all?? After all, if it doesn't arrive safely, then who
knows who has it... And if so, then you don't need a copy that could, say,
accidently get smuggled out and sold to [foreign government, domestic
covernment, competitor, curious onlooker - pick one] for the right sum of
money.

For your next version, you might want to add in the capability for a slight
remixing of the random pool at both ends (a passphrase, for example)
protected by secure-hashing properly-sized chunks. There's nothing like
being able to lock the door behind you, ya know...
