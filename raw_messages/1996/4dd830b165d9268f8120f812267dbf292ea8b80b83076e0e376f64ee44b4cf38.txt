        If RSA made toasters...
           They'd tell you the price *only* after finding out how much toast
you wanted to make and how badly you wanted the toast; then they'd insist on
you making a piece of toast for them every time you used the toaster.

        If cypherpunks made toasters...
           Jim B and Black Unicorn would argue about whether toast should be
buttered, and what the appropriate flavor of jam/jelly should be; TC May
would point out that it wasn't really toast, but rather, sliced and
slightly-burned bread; Perry would kvetch about the lack of crypto-relevance
of toasters; and a few others would form a new listserver for toasterpunks.
The service department would be flooded with calls from newbies, asking how
to make toast.

        If Netscape made toasters...
           They'd beta-test the toasters for months, then make one slot too
wide and the other too narrow. It wouldn't be until a cook in a diner
pointed out that the toast wasn't coming out right that they'd have their
design reviewed by a 3rd-party Toaster Engineer.

        If Microsoft made toasters...
           They'd put the slots on the side, the actuator on top, make the
cord too short, and design it to only run properly on 177V, 41Hz. Then
they'd declare the toaster to be the new industry standard.
