 First I would like to mention Lucky that I always enjoy your
posts. Second I would like to say that as I have mentioned
previously, the RBOC I work for filed for complete unbundling of
the local loop in March of 93. We are not the one's holding up the
show.

10 Mb/s ethernet and 100 ISDN B channels (64k each)? I would
certainly like to here more! Unfortunately as I have also
previously pointed out, point-to-point copper is a thing of the
past, it is rare and expensive now. The current fiber-to-the-curb
standard involves "slick 96" muxes which use 4 framed T-1's (1.536
Mb/s) to provide 96 voice channels.

Thanks for the info.
