This Saturday, Turing Auditorium, Noon-5. Unrestricted Ethernet
connectivity (both thinnet and 10BaseT) will be available; email me for an
IP address. Turing Aud has a Mac and a PC on the Net connected to an 
EXCELLENT presentation system. If you have something you'd like to show 
off, this is the place, and we're still short on topics.

Graphical actualizations of ideas raised at the last meeting regarding 
crypto GUIs would be one way to use the space.

The agenda is rather slim... Hugh was working on it, but nobody seems to
have anything to say. If we get really desperate for ideas, I might end up
talking about what I've REALLY been doing for the last five months. Dave
Harman will probably miss this one, but he's still invited.

Long, anal form of the directions follows.

 Or, get to Stanford's Campus Drive via 280-Sand Hill or 101-El Camino
 Real-Embarcadero. From 280, take Campus Drive left (clockwise). From 101,
 take Campus Drive right (counterclockwise). Turn South (centripetal) at
 Panama Street and take an immediate left into the Jordan Quad parking lot
 (empty on weekends). Walk between Pine and Redwood Halls to Polya. 
 Turing is between Polya and Cypress. It doesn't appear on most campus
 maps, but it's there, honest. Entrance to Turing Auditorium is by the
 Pac Bell payphone sign.
