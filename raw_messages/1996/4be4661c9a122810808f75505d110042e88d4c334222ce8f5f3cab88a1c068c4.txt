In this regard, I called into a local (NYC) National Commie Radio talk show
(Brian Lehrer's) last year and was talking with the host about G. Gordon
Liddy's remarks on shooting federal agents who unlawfully break into your
hose.  I said that self defense *could* (not necessarily *would*) work as a
defense to a murder charge involving the killing of federal agents in this
circumstance.  He asked me if I could come up with any examples from real
life where this had worked and I immediately shot back with "Yeah, Randy
Weaver and Kevin Harris."  That was the so-called Ruby Ridge case.  They
were acquitted of murder.

Then there was the guy in New York who shot six NYC cops who surrounded the
apartment where he was hiding (none died).  He was acquitted of assault and
attempted murder charges because he argued that he thought the cops had been
sent to kill him by the drug dealers that it was his profession to rob.
Love those NYC juries.  And they say that there's no justice for a black man
in Amerikkka.

Don't try this at home though kids.  Better to be elsewhere when they come
looking for you.
