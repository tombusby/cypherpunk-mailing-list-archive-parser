After reading about the great moral indignation & general dispeptitude
people seem to be finding over Dimitri's removal, I basicly have
one response.

Get a life.

I mean really, the guy was (and is) freakin intolerable. He just caused
major noise on the list and that's about all.

The bottom line is that his removal just makes the list a more
sane, less crap filled place.

As for all the upset & indignation, well jesus, like you people can't
find better things to get indignant about? How bout spending the
same amount of time writing to your congressman about the bletcherous
crypto policies being promoted by government facists? Or the same
amount of time on sticking an html interface to an anon remailer
in your web page... etc. 

It just comes across as sanctimonious and incredibly irrelivant b.s.
for people to be "upset" in any way over some nitwit being jerked
off the list after he's been given far, far, more reasonable alternatives
than to act the way he had been.
