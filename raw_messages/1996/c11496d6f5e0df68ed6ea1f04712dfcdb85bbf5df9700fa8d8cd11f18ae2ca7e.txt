Well, unfortunately the force of your will can't change fact.  Nor can the
use of profanity or caps.

Funny, I got mine without preforming such research.
I think you better write to Harvard and Georgetown and tell them they are

You claim that a J.D. and Doctorate in Law are the same degree.  I show

I'm cowering from the big powerful hacker with a Doctorate in Law and such
scary words.

You seem quite familiar with the disciplinary boards proceedures.  I think
a query for their records might be interesting.  Perhaps it would make an
entertaining post.

Clearly you were never a criminal lawyer.
