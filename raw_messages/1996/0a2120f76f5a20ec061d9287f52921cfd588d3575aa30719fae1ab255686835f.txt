Or, just maybe, some DoJ employees wanted to see what folks on the outside
were doing to tweek their bosses:-)? Reminds me of the *thousands* of hits
the "Intel Secrets Page"(http://www.x86.org/) has gotten from users at
intel.com since it went up. True, Intel was considering legal action against
the site, but there's almost no way all those hits are from Mr. Grove's
investigators....
