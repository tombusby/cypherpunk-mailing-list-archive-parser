I played with Magic Money recently.  I wondered:

Where are the passwords of the various PGP keys stored?

Now, suppose you want to use this system for serious use:

What, if any, are the critical files that must be protected
from outsiders to prevent tempering (altering without the owner's ability to
quickly discover the manipulation) with the system data?

Is is necessary to encrypt the whole client directory when you
don't use it?

Ditto, for the server?
