This is probably a bit off-topic; if so I apologize.

Can anybody comment on the item forwarded below my sig file? It claims
there's a database w/ people's credit card no's etc on it and you have to
give your name and social security number to get off of it.  This strikes
me as being a scam to get your ssn, but this went around at work and
people are actually calling and giving it out.  I know ssn's aren't really
as secure as they're supposed to be, but  still...

So, does anybody know if this database is for real or if it's just a scam?

TIA,
Mary Wise
