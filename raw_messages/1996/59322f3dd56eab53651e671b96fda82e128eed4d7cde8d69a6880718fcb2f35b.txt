	gee, Alan, maybe I was a bit hasty calling you a liberal!  but at
    least your friends got a laugh out of it. they say as you get older,
    you are supposed to mellow...  Tim --any comment, are you more or less
    irrascable? I know my answer!

	looks like the Telegraph is retracting the stories in a big
    way, including the possibility PRZ may be a hero for freedom!

	This is a contest:

1.	    "The Constitution is not a law, but it empowers the people
	to make laws....  The Constitution tells us what shall not be a 
	lawful tender.... The legislature has ceded up to us the 
	privilege of enacting laws as are not in consistent with the 
	Constitution of the United States.... The different states, and 
	even Congress itself, have passed many laws diametrically 
	contrary to the Constitution of the United States.
	    "...Shall we be such fools as to be governed by its laws, 
	which are unconstitutional?  No!  ...The Constitution 
	acknowledges that the people have all the power not reserved to 
	itself. I am a lawyer, a big lawyer and comprehend heaven, earth, 
	and hell, to bring forth knowledge that shall cover up all 
	lawyers, doctors and other big bodies. This is the doctrine of 
	the Constitution, so help me God. The Constitution is not law to 
	us, but it makes provisions for us whereby we can make laws. Where
	it  provides that no one shall be hindered from worshipping God 
	according to his own conscience, is a law. No legislature can 
	enact a law to prohibit it. The Constitution provides to regulate
	bodies of men and not individuals."

2.	    "If we have to give up our chartered rights, privileges, and 
	freedom, which our fathers fought, bled, and died for, and which
	the constittion of the United States and of this state guarantee
	unto us, we will do so only at the point of the sword and the
	bayonet."
	
 !!!    the test: who said this, and when, and where is it referenced?

        I haven't figured out a prize, but maybe a character mode face
    --how about Bubba?  or even better yet, King Hillary, standing up to
    give the oath before Congress tomorrow --do you think she will finish
    the oath as written: "So help me God"  -?  

	too bad I do not even own a television (snake oil makes me break
    out in hives); Hillary should be great as my money says she will still
    lie --until she learns that the only way of not trapping yourself 
    in contradictions eventually means your tell the truth

	I agree, except the press forgets rights in favour of scandal

	advertising dollars going down the drain. litigation, even if 
    frivolous against corporate advertisers for supporting falsehoods
    and innuendos which will destroy the american way of life. Stockholder
    lawsuits are often the most effective.  I do not like the "means" of
    U.S. Courts, but they are always using the courts against us, so 
    turnabout is fair play.
