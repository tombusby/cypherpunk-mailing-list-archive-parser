Notably, the emphasis is on the needs of business, not "people."

We are in an excellent position to observe and document the process whereby
"business" -- that is, organizations motivated primarily, if not exclusively,
by the desire for short-term profits accruing to vested interests -- comes
to dominate and control a technology.  The auto and television industries come
to mind as two prior examples.  We are about to see the net go the same way.
Take notes.

			"I have to praise the administration and Ira for
                      reaching out to the private sector for
                      comments," Computers and Communication
                      Industry Association President Ed Black said.
                      "There's a great emphasis on the needs of

                      Even so, privacy activists remained
                      disappointed with many of the document's
                      features. "This isn't anything new," said David
                      Banisar, counsel to the Electronic Privacy and
                      Information Center. "The privacy stuff is
                      terrible. They say it's market driven, but
                      markets don't work with privacy. It's like what
                      happened with P-Trak."
