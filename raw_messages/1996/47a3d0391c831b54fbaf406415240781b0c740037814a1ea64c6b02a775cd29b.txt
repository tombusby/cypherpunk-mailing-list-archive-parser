If it's been done, it won't likely make any difference. Information that would 
affirm or refute the existence of an investigation by law enforcement is 
exempt from FOIA.

 Have the cypherpunks requested data on whether they are being investigated
 by the same agencies under the FOIA individually or as a group listed by
 that name? If so, what are the results, if any, so far?


Does anyone know if this has been done? The FOIA, that is.
