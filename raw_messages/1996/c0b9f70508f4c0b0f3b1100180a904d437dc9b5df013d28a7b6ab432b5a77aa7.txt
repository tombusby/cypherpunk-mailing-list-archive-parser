It seems that you have a very broad view as to what constitutes terrorism. 
According to you, somebody who hacks into a system is a cyberterrorist. It 
seems, that would make a burglar a real life terrorist, too.

So, to state my point: you use the word cyberterrorism in conjunction with 
ALL possible attacks on a system. Did I get that definition right? If not, 
why not?
