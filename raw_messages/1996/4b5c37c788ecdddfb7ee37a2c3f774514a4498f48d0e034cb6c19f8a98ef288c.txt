Free evaluation is hardly a threat.

"SCO today announced plans to provide a free license
to use its popular UNIX systems, including SCO OpenServer and SCO UnixWare,
to anyone in the world who wants to use them for
educational and non-commercial use to enable the evaluation and
understanding of UNIX systems."

Hmmmmm. I don't even think that could qualify as a threat to Linux let alone
Microsoft.

The rest of "Unix Unbound" reads like an overpriced, underexperienced
marketeer wetdream filled with empowering bold moves, 20 years of this and
60 billion of that. The comparison with AT&T's similar move 25 years ago is
essential market-speak. Any student of posturing should study this.
