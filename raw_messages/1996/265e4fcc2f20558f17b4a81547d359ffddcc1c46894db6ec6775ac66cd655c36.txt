Well actually... The passphrase in a mixmaster remailer is defined as
an environmental variable at compile time. The passphrase is not
stored in any cleartext fashion but is embedded in the
executable. Additionally the newer Ghio code (Matt's latest revision)
has the passphrase defined as an environmental variable in
remailer.c. Once remailer is compiled, you can delete the passphrase
from the code. I can't speak for the freedom or other remailers as I
haven't tried them. It's a little harder to get the key than just
looking for a cleartext file that contains it. That is, if the
remailer operator is being careful.
