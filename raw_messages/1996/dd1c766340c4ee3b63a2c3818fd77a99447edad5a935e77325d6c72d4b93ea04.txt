A mimimal DES chip implementation can be found at:

It was written to go with a paper on DES Hardware I'm putting the
finishing touches on.  Note that this site requires a password to
belong to group ftpsec to download.
 
It will encrypt in 47 clocks (8 IP, 29 Key Schedule, 8 FP) or
decrypt in 46 clocks (28 Key Schedule), and will fit in some of
the larger FPGAs.
 
The paper, when finished, will describe various performance enhancements
such as double buffered IP and FP (which is covered by an Ultron patent,
although probably invalid), direct key schedule  (16 clocks), or
superscalar DES (approaching 1 clock per 64 bit block).

For any hardware wonks, this is done in Synopsys VSS, although the
README file contains enough information for other VHDL implmentations.

There are also 4 or 5 'C' programs for generating VHDL files of the
S Boxes in various configurations, and a sample 'C' DES program done
in 1988 for the original UNIX libdes (source included).  The 'C' program
can be used to generate equivalent structures for debugging your own
DES hardware variations.

The test vectors are from NBS Special Pub 500-20 (circa 1978).
