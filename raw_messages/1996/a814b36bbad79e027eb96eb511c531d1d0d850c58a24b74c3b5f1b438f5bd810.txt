Sorry if my formulation was unclear. I ment to point out that it is
acutally easier to commit fraud in a way that is undectectable than
in a detectable way. So on the assumtion that the concept of binding
cryptography is a good thing, this scheme is flawed.


But to answer your question: Encryption software has already been
available for years. You may argue that PGP is not very user-friendly,
but it is secure and every computer user who takes the time to read
the manual can use it. So nothing much would happen that will not
happen anyway or has already happened.

But since - as you admit - it is not possible to stop criminals, the
question is: Do you want to cause a dramatic drawback in privacy and
create new potential security hole just in order to force criminals to
do a few hour's work of installing a secure encryption system from the
Internet, or when that is illegal buy it on the black market?

Then it is not even necessary to use additional software to circumvent
government access. The user can simply configure himself as TRP for
the inner layer of encryption and the official one in the outer layer.
