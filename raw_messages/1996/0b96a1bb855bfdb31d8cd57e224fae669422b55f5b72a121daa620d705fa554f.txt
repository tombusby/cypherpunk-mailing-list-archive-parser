I did an Altavista search on Westat with these results:

1.) Westat's Internet site
2.) A document from the DEFENCE LOGISTICS AGENCY on YATS

I guess that phone call wasn't a scam after all...

BTW, whenever in doubt, just run your Internet browser and use the
search engines. You'll be amazed at how much info you can get by just
typing in a word or two.
