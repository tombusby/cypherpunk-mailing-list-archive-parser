DECA (pronounced "DECK-UH") is the FBI's program for the
Development of Espionage, Counterintelligence and
Counterterrorism Awareness. The DECA program disseminates
information concerning national security matters.
   
The FBI is the lead counterintelligence agency in the
United States. It has the principal authority to conduct
and coordinate counterintelligence and counterterrorism
investigations and operations within the United States.
The FBI, supported by other U.S. agencies as needed,
conducts espionage investigations when the subject of the 
investigation is not under the jurisdiction of the
Department of Defense, Uniform Code of Military Justice.

NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT LIST
   
The FBI's foreign counterintelligence mission is set out
in a strategy known as the National Security Threat List
(NSTL). The NSTL combines two elements:

*  First, it includes national security threat issues
   regardless of the country of origin.

*  Second, it includes a classified list of foreign
   powers that pose a strategic intelligence threat to
   U.S. security interests.

The issue threat portion of the NSTL was developed in
concert with the U.S. Intelligence Community and key
elements of the U.S. Government. As a result, the FBI
identified seven categories of foreign intelligence
activity that were deemed to be significant threats to 
U.S. national security interests. The FBI will
investigate the intelligence activities of any country
that are related to any of these seven issues. They are:

1. Proliferation of special weapons of mass destruction
   to include chemical, biological, nuclear, and delivery
   systems of those weapons of mass destruction.

2. Collection of information relating to defense
   establishments and related activities of national
   preparedness.

3. U.S. critical technologies as identified by the
   National Critical Technologies Panel.

4. Targeting of U.S. intelligence and foreign affairs
   information and U.S. Government officials.

5. Collection of U.S. industrial proprietary economic
   information and technology, the loss of which would
   undermine the U.S. strategic industrial position.

6. Clandestine foreign intelligence activity in the
   United States.

7. Perception management and active measures activities.

National Security Begins With You
  
You may be the target of foreign intelligence activity if
you or your company are associated in any of the critical
technologies listed above. Foreign powers may also seek
to collect U.S. industrial proprietary economic
information and technology, the loss of which would
undermine the U.S. strategic industrial position. Foreign
intelligence collectors target corporate marketing
information in support of their nation's firms. Overseas
travel, foreign contact, and joint ventures may further
increase your exposure to the efforts of foreign
intelligence collectors. If you suspect possible foreign
intelligence activity, or have questions concerning the
National Security Threat List strategy, please contact
the FBI DECA Coordinator at the FBI Field Office nearest
you.
