This happens any time anybody signs up with an an######@anon.penet.fi address.
Ideally, someone could, in their copious spare time, hack majordomo
to automatically translate all subscription requests of that form to
na######@anon.penet.fi ; as an alternative, if majordomo has some sort
of subscription blocking list an*@anon.penet.fi belongs on it.
