Hi!

I read the work Cypherpunk often in alt.security.pgp and alt.privacy

I had no idea what it is.  So I hit Lycos and it led me to various, but unfortunately unclear articles.

So, here is my question: what is cypherpunk?

I suppose, from the adress, that it is some type of mailing list.

If yes, could anybody send me the "how to subscribe" file?

Thanks.

JFA
