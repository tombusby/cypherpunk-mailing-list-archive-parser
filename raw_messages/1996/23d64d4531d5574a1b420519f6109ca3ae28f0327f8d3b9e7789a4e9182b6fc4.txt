Contracts are the key. If Alice contractually agreed to hold data
confidential, then didn't, Bob would have a case for suing. If Bob revealed
information without a contract, Alice can do with it as she pleases.

And in most of the cases I was talking about a few days ago (I was gone for
the weekend and could not participate in this debate until now), Alice is
using various records or observations that are free for anyone to remember,
save, use, etc. Alice compiles a dossier on Bob based on press items,
public court records, bankruptcy filings, divorce decrees, and all the
various things that are available to anyone who is "observant."

(The government has attempted to interfere with this record-keeping and
-reporting, such as with the "Fair Credit Reporting Act," which makes the
"remembering" of bankruptcies, defaults, and other such indiscretions a
crime if the records are greater than 7 years, or somesuch. My point is
that such laws are not only unconstitutional, even under the "regulate
commerce" clause, but are laws which ultimately invite the government to
inspect the files and records of someone...so much for "secure in one's
papers.")

Face it, if one makes public utterances, or utterances on lists like this,
or one files for bankruptcy protection, or any number of such things, then
others can and will "remember" these things. How they use these
remembrances or who they pass them on to, or sell them to, has *never* been
something that the U.S. government has been empowered to control or
regulate. Until recently, of course. All to the worse.

As others have noted, the proper solution is to make contractual
arrangements with those doing blood analyses, or handling the data. It
works for financial data, more or less, and so on. There is no
justification (and many reasons against such a thing) for invoking some
nebulous "right to personal information."

Fine, you draw the line at "Cypherpunks information can be revealed, but
you'd better not reveal XYZ." Others would use your same logic to argue
that even the "who cypherpunks" command information is "private" and not to
be compiled into a dossier or revealed or, God forbid, sold.

Again, what are the contractual relationships?

Here you seem to be referring to contracts. A good start.

And much better than mere appeals to intuition about what ought to be
private and what ought to be public.
