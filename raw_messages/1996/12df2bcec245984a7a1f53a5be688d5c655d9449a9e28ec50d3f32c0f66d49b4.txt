I was asking for you to support your position that my 'assumption' that 
"this reaction" will continue (i.e. that telecos and ISP's would 
cooperate with investigations), was false.  What the history of wiretaps 
has to do with this, except that it supports my position the government 
has enough intimidation power to bully their way, is not clear.

Actually, this is not reasonable to assume, mostly because it's false.  
While some very small number of illegal wiretaps might have involved phone 
company complicity, the vast majority of illegal wiretaps were of the 
alligator clip vareity and require little if any phone company 
assistance.  This is why Digital Telephony was such a big deal.

This is indeed a creative intrepretation.

I don't follow.  Phone company does outrageous things to help feds, so 
it's safe to assume that they would do less?

I have never offered the view that these things are not distasteful.  You 
see inconsistancies in my view because you have assigned that position to 
me.  The reality is that all court rulings require a bit of whim.  We 
differ in that I don't suggest killing judges is the way to deal with it.

Change the sentence above to indicate that I take the position that is it 
"difficult in the extreme to prevail in court against those actions." and 
you have hit my position on the head exactly.

Again, you find this amazing because you have attributed to me an 
approval of this status quo which I do not have.

I find it interesting that Mr. Bell, who demands formalism as a rule when 
reading the bill of rights, is so quick to condemn officials to death 
without their right to due process.

How is this a contradiction?

Service providers can expect to have their equipment preemptively seized 
if there is reason to believe the data might be destroyed (this is the 
sun devil example) and as such if you want to resist compelled discovery 
as an ISP, an open policy that you will assist the account holder in 
thawarting the authorities is not the way to do it.

Ripco BBS and Steve Jackson Games both contested their seizures with 
passion.  It didn't get them their equipment back any sooner.

The result will simply be resort to seizure warrants to get the 
equipment, followed by contempt charges for refusal of the account holder 
or ISP to reveal the key.

You can fight this, sure, but it's only going to do you any good if you 
win.  In any event the ISP will be out the equipment for the duration.  
Prosecutors are not going to take these developments sitting down.

And so how is B less required to comply with the law, including 
cooperating with lawfully issued search and seizure warrants executed by 
duly appointed law enforcement officials, appearing to testify at the 
request of the court and complying with court orders?

I thought it might be easier for you to understand.  Clearly this was my

Mr. Bell proves that no knowledge is a dangerous thing.

It was Mr. Bell's position that an ISP would provide warning to an account 
holder, and if it refused it would be subject to the consequences of 
breeching some agreement.  This was how he 'got around' the problem of 
the authorities compelling the ISP to cooperate in their investigation.  
To do so, he argued, would expose the ISP to contractual liability.

A clause in a contract which reads, and to be clear would have to read, 
"ISP shall send regular certifications until such time as law 
enforcement officials, civil litigants, or other parties unrelated to the 
account holder enquire as to or require disclosure of account holder's 
personal information or data."

Now, please tell me how this clause, and the warning therein, is passive 
resistance.

I merely acknowledge that government centric enforcement is the status

I can't comment as to ISPs.  BBSs have been a frequent victim of compelled 
discovery and preemptive seizure.  Why precisely you think that court's 
will make a distinction must be an interesting chain of logic.

Compelled discovery is a wide judicial tool.  I don't know what the 
circumstances under which it would be ruled illegitimate would be.  I am 
almost positive that these circumstances would not include an 
uncooperative and or obstructive (legal or illegal) ISP.
