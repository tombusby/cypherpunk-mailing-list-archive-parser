	SINGAPORE CRACKS DOWN ON INTERNET

	The Singapore government has informed Internet content and access providers
	that it will hold them responsible for voluntarily restricting pornographic
	and politically objectionable material in transmissions to the country's
	100,000 Internet accounts.  The Singapore Broadcasting Authority is charged
	with enforcing the ban on materials that could "undermine public morals,
	political stability or religious harmony."  Most content providers will be
	deemed "licensed" unless they violate the restrictions, but political and
	religious groups must register their online intentions with the SBA.
	Punishments for transgressions have not yet been determined.  (Wall Street
	Journal 6 Mar 96 B6)
