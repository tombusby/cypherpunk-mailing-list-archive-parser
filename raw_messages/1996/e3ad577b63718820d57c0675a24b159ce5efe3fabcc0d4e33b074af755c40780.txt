This doesn't work because the input and output buffer will almost always be of
different lengths.

No.  Each chunk is a new hash with <whatever>, where <whatever> defaults to
SHA1.  Since (for SHA1) 64 bytes of input affect each 20 bytes of output, I
don't think there's much need for chaining.  I'm trying to keep the
specification as simple and easy to check as possible (one of the problems with
the PGP data management was that it was rather complex and hard to follow.  I
suspect it would be difficult to implement a compatible version going only from
a written specification).

The input wraps, just like the output, so for example the letter "a" would be
hashed as:
 
 <length>a<length>a<length>a<length>a<length>a<length>a[...]

That's another possibility.  The only thing here is that you're only changing
one byte for each pass, and I'm not sure if this is healthy.  I'll see what the
sci.crypt crowd (those who've survived the spamming) has to say about this - it
may actually be stronger than my increment-by-one method if you're worried
about related-key cryptanalysis.
