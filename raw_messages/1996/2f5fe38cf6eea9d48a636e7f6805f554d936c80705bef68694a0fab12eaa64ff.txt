 Two reports lagging the attack on tamperproof devices
 post last night from the Info Sec Group of NUS (which
 we've put at: http://jya.com/isghak.htm):


 10-22-96. Reu:

 "Singapore scientists invent secure Internet system"

 The new system, developed by the NUS team in
 collaboration with several banks for Singapore at a cost of
 Singapore $500,000 (US$355,000), used smartcard technology
 which allowed the transmission of hidden digital signatures.
 Sponsors of the new system include Singapore's four large banks
 -- Development Bank of Singapore, Oversea-Chinese Banking
 Corp Ltd, Overseas Union Bank Ltd, United Overseas Bank Ltd
 -- as well as Singapore Telecommunications Ltd and Citicorp's
 Citibank.

 10-22-96. PrNe:

 Biometric Technology Firm Refutes Reports of Vulnerability 
 to Smart Card
 
 A biometric facial recognition protects smart cards from tampering 
 by denying access even if digital codes are obtained. According 
 to the company's president, recent  reports from U.S. and Israeli 
 researchers on ways to crack encryption codes are needlessly 
 alarming security managers in government and industry.
