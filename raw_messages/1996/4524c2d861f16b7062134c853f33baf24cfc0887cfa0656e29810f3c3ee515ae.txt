-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

We have finally released a Windows '95 version of PGPfone. This release
includes PGPfone for Macintosh version 1.0b6 and PGPfone for Windows '95
version 1.0b1. Note: The Macintosh version does not talk to earlier versions.
However the Macintosh and Windows version talk to each other!

Connections can be either via modem or the Internet.

Note: This code is beta test code. Future changes may continue to be
incompatible with these versions.

Also Note: We are now only distribution PGPfone via the World Wide Web, we
have shutdown the PGPfone FTP site. To get PGPfone over the Web, go to
the PGPfone home page at:

        http://web.mit.edu/network/pgpfone

WE CAN ONLY DISTRIBUTE PGPFONE TO U.S. PERSONS AND CANADIAN CITIZENS.
