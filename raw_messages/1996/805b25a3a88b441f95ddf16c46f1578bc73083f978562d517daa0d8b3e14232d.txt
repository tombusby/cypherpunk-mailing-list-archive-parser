That's a good solution.  Another idea might be to stego the 
accounting info (real info ;) inside one of pictures using a similar 
method.... in some ways this method is better suited for stego since 
it becomes lunacy for the cops to insist that every picture or 
audiofile  you have has something or many things hidden... (unless 
they've been watching you and know you keep accessing your jodi 
foster pix after a client visits you...)
