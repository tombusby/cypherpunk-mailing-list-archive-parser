Seems to me Ms. Anonymous wasn't taking it seriously, but was posting the
news clip here for our amusement, or to show the kind of shabby work some
journalists do, or to scare us by demonstrating how insane rumors get
started.

I can't imagine that anyone who knows the address of the cypherpunks list
and can use an anonymous remailer could take a ridiculous claim like that
seriously.
