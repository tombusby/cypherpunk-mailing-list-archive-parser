People outside of the US may be interested to know that there is a small,
fully legal, free browser with 128-bit SSL security: it's called
WorkHorse, and is available with ftp from ftp.mkt.co.uk (that must have
got a 110 bps feed, if the connection speed is of any indication). The
link inside Banknet's home page, at http://mkn.co.uk/bank/, seems to be
wrong and anyway most browsers time out before getting connected.

WorkHorse's interface is pretty ugly and the rendition is buggy, but the
SSL connection does work: I got through mbanx's "Sign in" link
at http://www.mbanx.com/banxing/5welcome.html , whereas MSIE and NS3 were
kicked out due to their 40-bit RC4 limit.
