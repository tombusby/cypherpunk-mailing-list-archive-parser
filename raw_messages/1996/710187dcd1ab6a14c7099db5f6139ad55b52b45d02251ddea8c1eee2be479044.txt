        First, I'd be interested in knowing some of those online reporting
addresses, and how much limits they place on what can be mailed to them...
persuading these cops to deal with the improper use of another's computer
(i.e., spam) would seem to be a distinct possibility in diverting them from
other activities. Second, it would appear possible (unless they're 
encrypting
it) to intercept some of these email lists of theirs - if necessary, by
forging a subscribe to an _overseas_ nymserver that isn't too well known
(unlike, say, anon.penet.fi). That's about on the same grounds as their
mention of "know thine enemy." (It is, of course, pretty certain that
various libertarian groups are among those monitored, such as cypherpunks.)
Third, this gives additional reasons not to give out one's address to 
anyone.
What people know about me is a post office box and my old address.
        -Allen
