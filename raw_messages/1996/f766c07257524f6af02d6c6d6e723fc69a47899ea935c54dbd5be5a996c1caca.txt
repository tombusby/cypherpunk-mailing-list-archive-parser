Been tried.  Does not work.

1.  If foreign capital is allowed to freely enter and leave, internal
players find ways to sneak their capital out.  This forces the

in ways that at best terrify them (such controls look very much
like creeping confiscation), and at worst cause them huge harm
with no real benefits to anyone.
