"Key Decisions Likely On Encryption Exports" by Stephen Barlas

    In fact, should he win, Clinton may go on the offensive.
    Goodlatte, whose bill is the House companion (HR 3011) to the
    Burns bill, said the Clinton administration told him that if the
    computer industry does not agree to a key management
    infrastructure, the President will seek legislation forcing
    Americans to use only encryption to which the government has
    access.

Of course, this intention (to outlaw all non-GAK/KRAP) has been the
desires of FBI/CIA/NSA all along, so no big surprise.  I just would
hate to see Congressional leaders cave in because of the "threat" of
the administration's bozos attempting to introduce more restrictive
legislation.  The old "if we want 5, we demand 10, and we'll get 5 in
the compromise" plan is really screwy and dishonest.
