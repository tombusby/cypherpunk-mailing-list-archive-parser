howdy folks,

so what?  fv has a keyboard sniffer...

if you're going to d/l programs from the net and not pay attention to 
what's going on you'll always be at risk and a fool as well.

for what it's worth, this sort of program could easily be used to get 
info more important than credit card numbers.  passphrases and 
passwords of all kinds could be obtained leading to broken accts or 
worthless cryptography.

additionally, this hardly has anything to do with netscape.  this is not 
a 'bug' in netscape.  it's a malicious program.  the only way to prevent 
malicious programs from causing you problems is to know what your 
computer is doing; what it's loading when you boot and what data it sends 
through your phone lines when you're online.

my $0.02...
