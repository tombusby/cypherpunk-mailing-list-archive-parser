The coauthors (the other works for Science Applications) have never
supplied evidence for the verbal claim, as Michael notes. From there paper,
they seemed ill-informed, and apparently took most of their material from
published Web pages (e.g., Raph Levien's).

But I'm not as sanguine about chaining being enough. Think of it as a
"percolation" problem, similar to finding a path through a network.

To make this clear, if there are M remailers and N of them are "colluding"
(whether NSA-controlled or working for Burger King), and one chooses O of
them for a chain, what are the chances that one is compromised? To put some
numbers on this, if there are 30 remailers and 15 are NSA-owned and one
picks 5 remailers in a chain, there's a 3% chance that all the remailers
picked are NSA-owned. And so on. A standard probability calculation.

There are nuances to consider. Reputations of remailers (beliefs by others,
a la Demptster-Shafer propagation of beliefs). Using one's self a remailer
is always a nice touch. And so on.

I do think there is almost no chance any of the "well-known" remailers are
NSA or GCHQ-controlled, but the situation may change as remailers become
less well-known and more fluidly instantiated, and as the NSA begins to
take more serious notice of remailers than they apparently have so far.
