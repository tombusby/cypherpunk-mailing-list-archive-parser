Jumping on the bandwagon a bit here...

Walt makes a plausible business case for key escrow for software
that encrypts static information for archival purposes. 

Has anyone been able to come up with a good business case for
key escrow of communications keys? Note that if you're concerned
about communications history, that this is really just a special
case of static information that is archived.

Note that all key escrow proposals to date have focused almost
entirely on  "escrow" of keys used in communication. The recent
attempts to manufacture a business case for this by confusing
these two very different situations is part of the tactics we have
come to expect from the government when dealing with this issue.

If anything good can be said about the badly written, vague and
clearly unconstitutional new regulations from the Department of
Commerce, it's that they're less mealy-mouthed and weasling than
previous attempts to explicate the government position on 
cryptography.
