I don't have any connection with these guys, except that I use
their software.  Check out www.privnet.com and the Internet Fast
Forward netscape plugin for Windows.  It can selectively filter
cookie transmissions to web servers as well as some other very
cool stuff like filter out unwanted images, including but not
limited to advertisements.  You will be amazed how much more
information you can get on your screen when you filter out the
useless images, like the one netscape puts at the top of their
home page.

I know who'd enjoy seeing someone in uniform on their porch are leathermen...
