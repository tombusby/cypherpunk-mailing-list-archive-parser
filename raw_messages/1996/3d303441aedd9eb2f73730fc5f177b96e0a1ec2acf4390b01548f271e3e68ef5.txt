This does appear to address both my moral concern (raced-based lending) as
well as my liberty concern (favorability of less regulation).  I support
the repeal of much of the over-burdensome banking regulation already in
existence.  I continue to work closely with a Congresscritter who satrted
off on the Banking Committee (Now has a good Ways and Means seat) whom I
have expressed my concerns to.  What helps is to have concrete deregulation
proposals.  In Wisconsin I have supported the extension of personal
property tax exemptions to business computers (and an elimination of the
personal property tax in total.)

While discussions on the list often deal with theory it is important for
those with the inclination, to act.  Cypherpunks write Code (as in USCA? ;-)
