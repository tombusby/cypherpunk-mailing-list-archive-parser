Where did you live?  I used to walk home from school (in Ventura, CA - about 1
hour away from LA) and see a vending machine selling copies of "LA X-Press" (Or
something like that) right next to the vending machines for the Star-Free Press
and the LA Times.  This was on the curb by a busy shopping center, on the block
opposite of the County of Ventura's government center. Hypothetically, it was
even plausibly deniable (the watchword of the Clintons) - "I was just buying
this copy of the newspaper." And before someone asks, no, I wasn't buying them.
