While I've not read the book, what you describe fits with the concept of 
"sensitivity to initial conditions" that chaos theory discusses.

In this context, what Tim describes is a "sharpening" effect--i.e., the 
differences in initial conditions necessary to distinguish between the two 
eventual outcomes described is becoming smaller.  

A neat way to visualize this is to picture what happens when you crank up 
the contrast on a black and white TV.

Eric Hughes made an interesting comment, something to the effect that 
this process only seems to be occurring in occupations that have 
something in common, like easy transfer of job skill from one 
worker to another, I don't quite remember.  Anyone remember specifically?
