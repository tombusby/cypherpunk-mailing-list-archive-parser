There are a great number of errors in the book.  (Details of many can be
found at http://www.wam.umd.edu/~ctmunson/aol_cookbook_faq.html .)  

The one error I found in the book when I was in High School was the recipe
for Nitrogen Triodide. (sp?)  The Anarchist's Cookbook lists four steps for
making it.  The first two are correct.  The second two (running alchhol and
ether, if I remember correctly) dry the mixture out and probibly detonate it
in the process.  (The ether would make things much worse, as ether is pretty
volitile in and of itself.)

I found better formulas for simple explosives in "Lee's Priceless Recipes".
(Which was published in 1912.  Long before the Internet.)

Ah, memories of High School chemistry classes...
