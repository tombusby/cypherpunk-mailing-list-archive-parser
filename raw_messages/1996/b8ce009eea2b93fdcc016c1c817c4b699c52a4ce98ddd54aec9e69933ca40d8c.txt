I am sure this is a very real concern and a very real motivation for some
of the work being done on international key escrow (GAK--Global Access to
Keys?).

The various governments may be trying to get the several LEO satellite
projects to incorporate GAK circuitry now, before it's too late. Once the
satellites are up, and the handheld units sold in Fry's and CompUSA, it's
too late.

I'd hate to see the U.S. on the same side of the issue of free and open
communications (which means encrypted, if people so choose) as Burma,
Libya, Singapore, and France.
