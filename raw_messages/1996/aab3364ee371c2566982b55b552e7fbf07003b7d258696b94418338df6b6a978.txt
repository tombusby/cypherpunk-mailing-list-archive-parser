We don't think they're all NECESSARILY evil...they just turn out that way.

Whose fault is this?

Phase of moon?  Season?  Maybe it has something to do with the 11-year 
sunspot cycle?  Bi-millenialism?

The government seems to be BEHAVING as if it is always going to be our 
enemy.    Whose fault is that?

And it is our goal to not "get forked."

That's me...

On the contrary:  The existence of a "legal warrant" doesn't mean that the 
government ought to (or even can) get access to data via a "key recovery" 
system.  It's been mentioned numerous times that there are plenty of things 
that could be done (multiple encryption; encryption of GAK'd key; foreign 
key escrow with no request cooperation, etc) to prevent this.

Pollyanna, meet Eric Blair.

No, they're going to lean towards yet another system, (3), whatever suits them.

If it had not had the desire to "twist this process to evil ends" government 
wouldn't have interfered with the natural development of key-keeping systems 
which serve only the key owner, not anyone else.

And I am in favor of some kind of mechanism by which the government can be 
destroyed by ordinary citizens.

I'd disagree with that.  I've devised a system...

I guess that means that anything they call "reasonable," you'll agree with?

Hint:  Between about 1932 and 1968, wiretaps in the US were ILLEGAL.  
Nevertheless, they were done anyway, by the telephone company on request by 
the cops. (they were not admissible in court, however.)   Question:  Should 
we define the standard of 'reasonable' on the opinion of a group of people 
(cops, officials, politicians) who have a proven habit of using illegal 
techniques to get information?

Apparently, cops are unwilling to let illegality get in their way.  I'd say, 
on the whole, cops must have a rather enormous motivation to get wiretaps, 
and only a fool would think that this would fail to motivate them to adjust 
their standard of "reasonableness."

So far, such an opinion would fit the facts far better than anything you've 
said so far.
