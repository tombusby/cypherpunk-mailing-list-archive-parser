"I can't quite figure it out" - says a lot right there.

Per that comment about rationality: That LEA's knew about the ring, or 
that they would participate in a scam of some kind?

You should know that "many on this list" bears no relation to the LEA's 
mentioned above.  People on this list have relatively small agendas, in
