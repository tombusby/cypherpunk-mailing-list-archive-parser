    Not to harp, Tim, but the summation thought in and of itself is 
    probably "discriminatory" to many as it, intentionally or not,
    appears to single out a specific ethicnic group.

    OTOH, without or without the description, the indicated class best
    fits your model above --and I agree with the thesis; even so far as
    to say that the implentation of CA's anti-affirmative action, which
    is now blocked by yet another bleeding heart liberal Federal judge,
    will reduce tension vis a vis ethnic relations --if the supposed
    victims (of the what was at one time the ethnic majority in CA), will 
    stop crying.

    and so that everyone can see bigotry: when the demographic changes
    brought along their ethnic gangs, I moved the children to other 
    schools. when the billboards in the far NW corner of LA city/county
    were converted to Spanish a couple years ago--  

        "...that's it; we're leaving! now, regardless of the cost!"

  Now, with a black jack mule you wish to harness, you walk up, 
  look him in the eye, and hit him with a 2X4 over the left eye.   
  If he blinks, hit him over the right eye! He'll cooperate.  
        --so will politicians.
