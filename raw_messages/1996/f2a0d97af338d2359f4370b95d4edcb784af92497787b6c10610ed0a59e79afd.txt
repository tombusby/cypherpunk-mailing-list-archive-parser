	Yes; one could also take out a great deal of Washington DC via toxic
gas. (If it weren't flammable, hydrogen cyanide would work nicely; just mix
potassium cyanide and hydrochloric acid). Unfortunately, this would also kill
a lot of innocent people (including, under my system of ethics at least, some
governmental types. Look at Governor John P. Altgeld if you don't believe that
any can exist; he pardoned the Haymarket riot scapegoats, and ruined his
political career by doing so).

	You have a point. Of course, this gets back to the ever-present debate
over whether the death penalty causes deterrence or not. I suspect it doesn't
for most gang members; whether the actual (as opposed to rhetorical) psychology
of governmental employees would predict the same is an interesting question.

	You've got a "tragedy of the commons" problem. Everyone would assume
that everyone else would do it. (Admittedly, that libertarians have among the
highest charitable donation rates of any group may argue otherwise). Now,
targeting whoever audited you is a quite likely possibility.

	You have an interesting point here.
