I took the JavaScript stuff that was posted and put it in one of my web
pages (http://students.cs.byu.edu/~don/mail2news.html). I had to pick a new
address because support@netscape.com is reportedly now just an autoresponder.
I've disabled java, I've changed the mail server to null (from the default
localhost) and none of it stops the JavaScript from sending mail.
