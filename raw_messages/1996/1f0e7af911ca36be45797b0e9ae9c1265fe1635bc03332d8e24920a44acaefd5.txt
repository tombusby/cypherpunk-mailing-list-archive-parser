If you're _employing_ Anglos, you're currently required to disrespect their
honesty and demand proof that their papers are in order to fill out the I-9
form.
There's a list of "one from column A or one from columns B and C"
of acceptable papers, such as passports, birth certificates,
driver's licenses, US Military ID, etc., which the government uses
to determine whether they want to give you permission to hire them
and give them permission to work.  If you don't have these, 
you can join the Army, and they'll give you some papers.
I hope you weren't Un-American enough to be born at home, though -
without that government-issued birth certificate, the Army
won't be able to verify your age.

None of that is really proof of citizenship - after all, you could 
have renounced your US citizenship and become stateless or joined 
a foreign government.  But President Buchanan's loyalty oath requirements
should take care of that, as well as help with the problem of all these
immigrant Brits and Irish and Canadians flooding our shores - I mean,
look around you, they're everywhere.  Y'all can't walk into a 7-11 these days
without some clerk speaking funny-soundin' English at you.

And the reason you can't legally just hire contractors and not have them
count as employees has a lot to do with Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ),
who made a lot of money running ADP, a computer-services bodyshop,
that wanted to preserve its advantages against more flexible competition.
