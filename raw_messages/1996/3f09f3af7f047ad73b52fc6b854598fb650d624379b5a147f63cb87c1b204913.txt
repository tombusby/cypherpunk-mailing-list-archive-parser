how does posting notifications to the list satisfy that objective?

True.  But my opinion is that this list isn't the appropriate place 
for it.  Opinions were asked for, that is mine.  A separate list 
maybe...

Oh lord. I don't want to get into semantic hair-splitting.  It's the 
word I chose at the time.  It may be the wrong one.  Don't read too 
much into it.


To put the issue simply.

Bob doesn't like Jane for whatever reason.  Jane signs all her 
messages with PGP.  Bob posts false" bad signature notifications" to 
the list to discredit Jane.  Am I to just read Bob's messages and 
believe the notifications he's posted.?  No.  I still have to examine 
Jane's messages myself for signature authenticity.

I understand that this is one person who wants to perform this 
service objectively.  But why should I trust his motivations?  I 
still have to do my own individual signature checking to be sure.

For this reason, I think the idea accomplishes little.   The 
intentions are good, but I don't see a major benefit.  Maybe someone 
else has another idea or angle....
