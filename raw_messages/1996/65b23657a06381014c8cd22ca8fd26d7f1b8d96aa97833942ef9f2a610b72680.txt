I think this is exactly the point. On a given page I might have several
mailto tags. One for comments on some subject, one for feedback, and one
for the webmaster. I expect the person mailing me to take the time to use
the correct mailbox. I created a page urging political activism, and
included a mailto for all the relevant Senators and Representatives. I
hardly think they are interested in this kind of spam.

Trawling the web for every address you can find, then mailing them all
seems very inappropriate.
