I have anecdotal evidence (which I don't want to share) that certain college
teachers are reluctant to discuss state-of-the art crypto research in class
because they feel they're not supposed to share it with foreign students. It
may not be a fear of prosecution as much as the belief that it's against the
intent of the laws.

I recall that the (in)voluntary review process did slow down the publication of
ZKP by a year or so. Rather than rely on my memory, I'll dig up the exact
details and will most definitely get back to you.
