  Even private key systems are quite workable. I actually work 
  with these firms [large organizations] -- its what I do for a 
  living. They have existing systems based on KDCs (do you even 
  know what a KDC is?) and they function just fine. As for public 
  key technologies, they [large organizations] are in many cases 
  implementing technologies based on public key system.

  Key Distribution Centers, the center of Needham-Schroeder and 
  similar key management protocols, like the Kerberos protocols.

  Subject: breakable session keys in Kerberos v4 
 
  I'm a bit suprised this hasn't turned up yet on Cypherpunks.  A couple
  of forwarded messages: first, an announcement made Fri Feb 16 by Gene
  Spafford at COAST about an exploitable flaw they've found in Kerberos,
  and then a comment on the www-security list that it is due to a bad
  random number generator. Same old story!

  There will be a fix distributed by MIT later this week. The problem is 
  that the random number generator in V4 is worse then we thought! The 
  fix is to retrofit the V5 generator (which is decent) into the V4 KDC. 
  Note: Only the KDC needs to be updated, clients and servers are unaf- 
  fected.

  Kerberos offers a better network security model than ignoring 
  network security entirely.  Unfortunately, it is plagued with 
  holes, from windows that remain "authenticated" for hours while 
  the user is at lunch, to passwords that are stored in plain text 
  on the authentication server.
