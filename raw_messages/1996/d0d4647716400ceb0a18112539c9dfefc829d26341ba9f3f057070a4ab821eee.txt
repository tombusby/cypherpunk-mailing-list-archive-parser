It is possible to understand intelligence as "pattern matching" skills,
without having to have attendant math and statistics to define it more
precisely or clinically. This understanding (if you have it) is the key
to knowing that Black persons do *not* have less IQ than White persons,
regardless of the standardized tests.  Something I know about, as I've
scored in the top 1/1000 of one percent, etc.

Nice that you have good intuition on this point, however, the big question
in your paragraph is not wherefore the genetic determinant, rather, it is
the understanding of intelligence in its overall context, which I dare say
most researchers in that field are probably ill-equipped to grasp.
