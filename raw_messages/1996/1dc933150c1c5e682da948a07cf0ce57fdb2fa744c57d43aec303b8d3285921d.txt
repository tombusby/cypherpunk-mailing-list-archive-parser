Big deal.

Mispelling are an acknowledge means of screwing up the algorithms I gave you.
 However, they are usually close to the original spelling.  In addition, once
most of the cipher has been dealt with, these fall into place quite nicely
anyhow.

So tell me what the difference is between a bunch of messages with th, st, ya
da ya da and messages with instances of say 27 27 27 27 27 obviously the
dashes from your pgp insert.  If anything, you've added more ammunition
against your self.  Think expanded pattern matching if you can something like
pa*tern...

Including the user, after all, you show a transformation by setting all
vowels to the front, then a transformation into numbers, a shuffle by number
order, then a transformation back into letters.

During decryption:

How do you place the vowels into the correct position?

How do you place the numbers into the previous order before ascending sort
them?

You are a , lets see a good name I was once placed with,  a TROLL.

The first pot was not to insult you more so than to inform others of attacks.

This post can be considered a personal attack, you TROLL.
