Piracy.  Some pirates may have black Jolly Roger flags on their ships,
but most have flags that say "Coast Guard" or "Navy" or "Harbor Police",
and think they're protecting their National Security or something.
Satellite launching is generally somewhat government-controlled,
though you could get a remailer into space if you didn't tell the
government too much about it until it was launched.
The US apparently has restrictions on crypto capabilities of
satellites launched from the US, according to something I read on the
net once.  But I suppose you could launch a programmable satellite,
and then reprogram it by radio....
