Netscape didn't find www.PINmail.com for me, but I assume that it
probably costs money to sign up for pinmail.  If it's even $6,
you won't win by creating a few thousand accounts for the $5 commission :-)

Of course, anywhere you have a concentration of email,
especially where there's bait like a promise of privacy, you have
to wonder about security risks.  Besides PINmail, there's
www.mailmasher.com (which has a strong privacy policy),
www.hotmail.com (which wants more information and may do
advertising or something), and there are the big services like AOL,
Compu$erve, and Prodigy.  What would happen if Sameer and Lance gave in to
the Dark Side?   What would happen if ATTMail were taken over by TPC?
Risks happen - deal with it.

(OK, so nobody but AT&T ever really used ATTMail :-)  We still
own the Death Star.

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
  and the politicians had to count them all.
