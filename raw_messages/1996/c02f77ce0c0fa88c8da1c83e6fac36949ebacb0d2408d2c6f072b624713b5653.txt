Well, we're all operating based on speculation, as to intended modes of
operation, what the contracts may ask for, what may eventually get
delivered, etc.

Certainly the described mode, that of a police car _pursuing_ another car,
suggests a car-launched signal. Rewiring the nation's roads to include
buried cables in anticipation of a future use would be pretty expensive!

(And if the cops can plan for a suspect/fleeing car to pass a specific
location, low-tech solutions like laying a row of caltrops across the road
will do much the same thing as "zapping" (which may not even work.))

As to high-voltage zapping, on this I am _extremely_ skeptical, at least as
Jim's proposal above goes. Modern chips are equipped to deal with
high-voltage, having electrostatic discharge (ESD) provisions. Voltages a
lot higher than 20kv.

And getting this hv signal in to the interior of the engine compartment,
and past the various thermal and other shields would be a chore. Certainly
the rubber tires will provide an _awful_ lot of insulation!

No signal at the road level is going to get through the tires, at least not
until the dielectric breakdown of several inches of rubber and air is
achieved!

(And even then, what is the current path? Where does the current coming up
from the road surface go? Even lightning strikes, from above, where the
place for the current to flow is clearly down into the ground, have
virtually no effect on cars and especially not on the insides of cars.)

If cars routinely survive lightning strikes, involving hundreds of
thousands of of volts and fairly substantial currents, then I can't imagine
anything humans can plausibly do along the same lines having any effect.

I won't debate this further, though. I don't know just what the DARPA (or
whomever) contract is asking for. Maybe something can be built, maybe not.
