I have read that we already have proof that the FBI informant lied on
numerous matters.   I am not familiar with this proof, but it is 
consistent with the other facts surrounding this incident.

Let us put this in its proper context:  The FBI murdered Weaver's dog, his
wife, and his son, and did their damndest to murder Weaver.  They shot
his wife while she was holding a fully loaded assault baby in her arms.

They lied about this extensively on oath.  The judge and the jury rejected
their story during the prosecution of Randy Weaver.  Later, 
when inconvenient facts came out, they pleaded the fifth amendment.

Give a dog a bad name and hang him.
