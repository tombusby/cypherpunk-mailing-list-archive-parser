I agree about Netscape.  IMHO they started with their hearts in the right
place, but with a naive lack of experience in real-world security.  Since
their hearts are in the right place, and they have good people, they have
improved a LOT in the last year.

I was assuming that you would interface software crypto where the hardware
crypto goes.  The best way to hack this will depend on the specific
implementation.  (At the same time you are gronking* the software calls to
the hardware, you can gronk the signature checking code.)
