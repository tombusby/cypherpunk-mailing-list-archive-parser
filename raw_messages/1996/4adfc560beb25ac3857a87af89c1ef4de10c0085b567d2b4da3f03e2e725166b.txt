Gee, biotech has come a long way.  Now I can download the Anthrax DNA
sequence from the net and insert it in some carrier bacteria and start
making Anthrax bacteria.  Neat!

Or did he mean I can chemically synthesize Anthrax toxin?  Or did he mean I
can get information on culturing bacteria on the net, but must obtain a
sample of the bacteria from other sources?

BTW - My dictionary says that Anthrax is primarily an animal disease which
only occasionally infects humans.  It sounds like a poor choice for bio-war
terror.
