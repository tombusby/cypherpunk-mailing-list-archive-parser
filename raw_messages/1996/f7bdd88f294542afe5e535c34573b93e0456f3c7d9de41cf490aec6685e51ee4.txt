I would appreciate if everybody would stop using that example.  No
threat or heinous tone here, but simply a reasonable request. I am
getting tired of it.  Of course, the collectivist who wrote that
sentence is totally wrong because I never said such things in the
context he meant them. But again, it is not everybody that followed
the thread and I am fed-up of seing thoses words attributed to me. 

I have no problem in building my bad reputation myself.  I don't like 
it when other do it...

So, please, if ever you quote it again, put at the beginning of the
paragraph: "Vlad Z. Nuri wrote:" or 
"Vlad Z. Nuri aka L. D(R)otweiller wrote:"

Thanks and Regards.
