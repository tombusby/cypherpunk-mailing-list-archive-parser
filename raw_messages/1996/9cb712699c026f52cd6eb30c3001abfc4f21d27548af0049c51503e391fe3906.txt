It seems these arguments raise yet a third point.  It seems that one could
quite easily extend the 'Commerce Clause' to beyond our own borders and
infer that countries have no right to regulate Net commerce from servers
which originate outside their borders.  It seems a key question hinges on
the 'source' of authority for the laws of countries, which most would claim
is their NATURAL and INALIENABLE SOVERIGNTY insofar as matters of commerce
and diplomacy are concerned.  But should one country have the legal right
to regulate the commerce of parties with no physical presence within their
borders?  After all, if it is reasonable to assume too much of a burden for
interstate merchandisers to keep track of variations in state sales tax
rates and classifications for interstate publishers to keep track of
variations in the far less certain "community standards" of obscenity and
indecency, on what NATURAL basis should the U.S. (or for that matter any
country) attempt to impose such national burdens on international
merchandisers and publishers?
