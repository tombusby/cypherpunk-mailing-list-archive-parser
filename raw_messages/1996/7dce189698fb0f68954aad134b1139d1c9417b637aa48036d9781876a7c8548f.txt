I don't provide legal "advice" on the list.

If you mean, as I believe you do, that there is or can be a manner of 
"unofficial" expiration, I am in agreement with you.

This is about exactly correct.  While occassionally actual sentences are 
passed down, this is rare and contempt generally falls into the bucket of 
"until the witness becomes more cooperative."

The above is essentially correct.  The variable of the most consequence 
in such cases is the judge however.  One must convince the judge that no 
further incarceration will prove effective.  A witness' attorney could 
make showings to the court until he was blue in the face about the 
unavailability of the data because of cryptographic protocol.  He could 
even be right, but unless he convinces the judge, the witness is still 
going to be subject to the whims (yes, Mr. Bell, I do mean whims) of the 
judge.  Appealing contempt orders can be frustrating.  Most jurisdictions 
I've worked in use the "clear error" standard, which is difficult 
enough to beat in itself, and nearly impossible when the subject of the 
ruling before an appeals court is a fellow member of the bench.

To me this entire thread has threatened to suggest to people that they 
need only thumb their noses at the authorities, be it by cryptographic 
protocol or otherwise, and sit back in their easy chair and smile to 
themselves.  Practically speaking security is a self assured right in 
this regard.  Depending on anyone, be it your ISP, your attorney, or the 
constitution, is a foolish measure.  Mr. Parekh hit the nail on the 
head.  No ISP in its right mind is going to ask for trouble.  If I'm a 
prosecutor and I suspect that the ISP may be complicit in hiding 
evidence, I'm going to ask for a search and seizure warrant (a la sun 
devil) and just walk in and take the equipment I believe the data to be 
on and then satisify myself that it's unattainable.  In effect even some 
kind of insurance pool, or professional group of ISP's will have to 
provide for replacement of seized equipment to effectively prevent harm 
from government intervention.  This gets expensive real fast and as risk 
can only be assessed by the stated policy of the ISP with regard to 
resisting government, it will be the active resisters who find themselves 
with the whopping size premiums.

I understand that direct confrontation with government is appealing to 
the authority hater.  (I happen to be one).  Overt resistance, however, 
of the character suggested by Mr. Bell and others, is going to cause 
problems in two ways.  Firstly, its going to cause the individual 
resister a good deal of headaches.  Secondly, its going to make bad law 
eventually.

The solution is more about protocol than anything else.  

I'll be interested to see what courts come up with when it becomes clear 
that offshore and properly protected data is impossible to obtain with the 
current tools available to the judiciary.  I suspect that if enough big 
cases get stung by the crypto bee, someone is going to try and invent a 
bug lamp.  One need only follow the evoltion of law that followed strict 
banking secrecy in tax evasion to see where that might end up.
