This opinion summarizes what's wrong with the world today.

Facts are facts. Statements about reality. If I happen across a piece of
information, such as "Chris Adams is subscribed to the Cypherpunks list," I
need not get permission from Chris Adams to sell this fact to another.
(Unless of course I have a contractual relationship with Chris involving
this in some way.)

Not even in these Beknighted States, unless the laws have recently gotten
much worse that they were a short while ago.
