>          ELECTRONIC FRONTIER CANADA (EFC) --- PRESS RELEASE
>
>(For immediate release --- February 27, 1996)
>
>
>                "Freedom to Read" in Cyberspace
>
>        A few members of Electronic Frontier Canada have
>        developed an amusing and interactive Web page
>        to celebrate 'Freedom to Read Week'.
>
>The Internet, some people say, is out of control and in need
>of strict government regulation.  But just what might a censored
>Internet look like?
>
>One possible answer to that question is given by the "Black Thursday Machine",
>an interactive Web page that was the brainchild of three multimedia designers:
>Brian Hall, Andrew Chak, and Rob Stanley.  Stanley is also a member of the
>online civil-liberties organization Electronic Frontier Canada.
>
>"Black Thursday Machine" Web pages:     http://www.vex.net/~brian/Censored
>                                        http://www.hyperactive.net/censored
>
>The "Black Thursday Machine" invites Internet surfers who visit the site
>to type in the address of their favourite Web page, to see what it might
>look like if a Canadian version of the new and controversial American
>"Communications Decency Act" were put into effect.
>
>The "Black Thursday Machine" will fetch any page you request, but it
>presents you with a censored version.  The algorithm it uses is simple
>and unsophisticated -- but these are the same kinds of rules recently
>used by America Online and CompuServe when they blocked access to
>discussions including the words "gay", "sex", or "breasts".
>
>"Any naughty word is replaced by the word 'CENSORED' in bright red,"
>says Rob Stanley, who was the chief programmer.  Which words are on
>the forbidden list?  "It works just like government censorship,"
>says Stanley, "you don't get to choose.  It's an arbitrary process."
>
>The Web site has links to a few representative examples, including pages
>about "Breast Feeding", "Safe Sex", "Planned Parenthood", and help for
>troubled "Gay Youth", that are rendered almost unintelligible by the
>crude censorship.
>
>"Despite well-intentioned desires to protect children,"
>says Jeffrey Shallit, vice-president of Electronic Frontier Canada,
>"adults need to be able to communicate freely about controversial issues.
>Otherwise, we'll reduce the level of discussion on the Net to
>Winnie-the-Pooh."  Paraphrasing a U.S. Supreme Court Justice,
>Shallit said that censoring the net to protect children is
>like "burning down your house in order to roast a pig".
>
>"The 'Black Thursday Machine' demonstrates the ravages of censorship
>in an amusing and provocative manner", says David Jones, president of EFC.
>"I hope people will take a moment during 'Freedom to Read Week' to visit
>the web site because it illustrates what the wired world might look like
>if artistic expression, vigourous debate, and all the subtley of human
>communication and interaction were subjected to the cold, calculating,
>and heartless scrutiny of a machine that filters out what the government
>might deem as controversial, offensive, or just plain inappropriate for
>the eyes of its citizens."
>
>
> * Why "Black Thursday" ?
>
>New and harsh restrictions on what can be communicated through American
>computer networks were signed into law on Thursday, February 8th, 1996
>-- "Black Thursday".  "This sent a shock wave through the Internet,
>where concerned individuals around the world "Painted the Web Black"
>for 48 hours as a sign of protest," says David Jones, EFC president.
>
>
> * About "Freedom to Read Week" in Canada (February 26 to March 3)
>
>"The purpose of 'Freedom to Read Week'," says Sandra Bernstein,

>represents the Periodical Writers Association of Canada on the
>Book and Periodical Council's Freedom of Expression Committee,
