But of course one's compiler may have been subverted, as Ken Thompson
showed some years back. Software implementations are sensitive to different
sorts of attacks than hardware implementations are.

Me. I don't have any hardware crypto chips at all, and think it unlikely I
will in the next several years. So I use only software crypto
implementations. And I admit to not having verified that my copy of MacPGP
is the same one now at the various sites...I figure that if the NSA has
pulled a blag bag job on me and replaced my MacPGP with a special version
that I've got other problems to worry about!

Your mileage may vary. If I were responsible for crypto for large financial
transactions, I'd have a different set of worries.

Boycott "Big Brother Inside" software!
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
