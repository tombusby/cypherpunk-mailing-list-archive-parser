fast it would process commands before he typed them..

well, maybe we should update this measure to meet the range like they did 
with the bel.. since an encyclopedia per second (eps) is a useless 
measure, maybe we should institute the mega-encyclopedia per second, or 
`meps' which would be 1024x30volumes of text.. `this little number over 
here'll do 30 meps!'..
