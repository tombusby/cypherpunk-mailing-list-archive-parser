Does that mean that general-purpose ftp won't be accepted unless the
user gives up their email? Greaaaaaaat... Can't have it both ways, I
guess. What can be added as far as user control; inline vs non-inline,
for example.

The FTP explanation certainly explains why my personal system is able
to confuse the username part of it. And I know there's nothing anyone
can do about the reverse-ip, but what about http referral field? Will
there be a way to turn off (blank, actually) this field?

Jeff, your efforts are certainly appreciated - your ability to get these
things done is most valuable.


Regarding the anonymizer:
First, are there any working anonymizers yet?
Second, is there any ISP that would be willing to give a home to the
  anonymizer?
