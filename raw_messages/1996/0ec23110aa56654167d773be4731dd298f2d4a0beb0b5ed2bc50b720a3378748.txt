I admit I am at a disadvantage having deleted the first few messages on this 
thread without actually reading them -- but when I am out one day and come 
back to 200+ cypherpunk messages of which perhaps 10 are relevant to 
cryptography, I get a little quick with the delete.  However, I am assuming
from the stated speed requirement that the original query was intended for 
just such a hashing scheme.  I interpretted Ogren's comments along the lines
of "choose an algorithm based upon a best fit for the requirements, where
security is just one of the requirements (although the most important)" 
(quotes used to indicate paraphrasing rather than actual quote).  If these
assumptions are valid, then he is quite correct, for a blanket condemnation
of MD5 is unwarranted.  If the intended application is for use with 
signatures, then I too would be quite leary of MD5 -- but only if I am
signing a document that I did not originate OR I need to ensure the
validity of the signature for longer than 12 months.  Condemning an 
application of MD5 without understanding the specific requirements placed 
upon the hashing algorithm is unjustified.  Complacently accepting the 
strength of the algorithm for all applications based upon recent findings 
is foolish.
