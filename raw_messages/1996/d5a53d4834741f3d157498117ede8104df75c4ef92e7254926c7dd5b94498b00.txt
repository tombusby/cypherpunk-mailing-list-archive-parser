I couldn't resist smiling when I read this.  Not that I want their access 
cut; quite the opposite.  But it is REALLY reassuring to see the authorities 
behave in exactly the fashion you expect them to!  Attempting to cut off 
dissenting political voices IRL is de rigeur; now, this shows that they 
believe "threat" to the government posed by allowing others to voice 
contrary opinions on the 'net is real.
