Some lists require plenty of time to read each day (let alone if I go 
on a vacation for a few days and want to catch up).  Managing a 
rating system would double the work if I were to do it by hand-rating 
the raters, etc.

It's easier to put certain people or subject threads in a twit-list 
folder and delete the rest by hand rather than put twice that effort 
into a rating system... chances are most people who quickly tire of 
maintaining it, let the rating system run on autopilot and then 
disable it when they realize they missed something really important 
or interesting.
