I find it difficult to equate the actions of a volunteer grand juror
(which is what we were originally discussing before your knee started
jerking so wildly) or IRS auditor with those of Mengele. I am aware that
some so-called libertarian leaders accuse the IRS of crimes against
humanity, but I think they're demagogic idiots. See the non-libertarian
FAQ, at http://world.std.com/~mhuben/libindex.html

SW does not go after any old Nazi, just those convicted in absentia for 
enumerated crimes against humanity.

Of course I agree. Actually, at the Bay Area cpunks meeting the question
whether any law that can't logically be enforced is valid was brought up. 
Examples include the illegality of using credit information more than
eight (?) years old when evaluating a loan, proposed limitations on Web
spiders and Usenet archives, the Swedish laws that are supposed to outlaw
maintaining computerized records with just about any kind of information
about people without a license, and censorship in general.

Where we differ is that I think it's bad taste and bad ethics to invade
anyone's privacy. It's a question of "justifiable force" for me. I believe
just about everyone with any technical understanding who reads this list
has similar ethics. 

I don't post private email. I don't investigate politicians' home phone
numbers and past relationships. It's just not relevant, unless there's 
specific probable cause.

The threat of investigation is valid, and has a positive deterrent effect.
But no one should have to live under the assumption that she has no
privacy at all.
