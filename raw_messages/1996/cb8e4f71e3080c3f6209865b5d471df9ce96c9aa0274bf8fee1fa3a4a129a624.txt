To do that, the user's system have to communicate with the government,
which would be unlikely and avoidable.  Alternatively, if Lotus is willing
to release copies with different serial numbers (either on the disk
or printed on the label), the installation process could include
public-key encrypting a 64-bit key for the user with the GAK key,
generating a (say) 512-bit encrypted key which could be dragged around
in the headers or (if they wanted to minimize overhead) handed out
in 64-bit chunks with every message or some such silliness.
