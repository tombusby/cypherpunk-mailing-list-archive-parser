 mailto: links take you to a anonymous remailer web page that lets
          you choose among remailers.
 news: can be read anonymously but posting doesn't seem to work yet.
 If converts all links in a page to use the service.

 Some info does get through , such as your broswer type.
 Soon, i guess browsers programmers will start passing info there!

 Don't know what happens with shttp:? anybody tried?

 Slowness is probably because the "service" is free and they don't
  have the funds for more horsepower.

 They do claim that they cache documents, so if one person gets
  a page from a slow server then everyone else can get it faster.
  (of course they'd have to be faster!)
