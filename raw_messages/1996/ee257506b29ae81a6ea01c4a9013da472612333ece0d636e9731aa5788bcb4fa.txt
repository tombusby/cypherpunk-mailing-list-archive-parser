New Mersenne Prime!  2^1398269-1 is prime!
------------------------------------------

Thanks to everyone's hard work, GIMPS (Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search)
has discovered the 35th known Mersenne Prime!  Joel Armengaud made the 
discovery on November 13.  Amazingly, he kept this secret while he
double-checked the find on two other computers.  On the 18th, he notified
Richard Crandall, Chris Caldwell, and myself.  I verified it on my machine
on the 20th.  Slowinski, who was out of town at the time, provided the
independent verification on the 22nd.

As had been agreed upon before hand, credit for this new prime will go
to Armengaud, Woltman, et. al.
