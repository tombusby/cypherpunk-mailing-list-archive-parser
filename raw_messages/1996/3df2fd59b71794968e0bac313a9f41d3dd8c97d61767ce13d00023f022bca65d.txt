Certainly people would look for "loopholes" and mechanisms for reducing
their officially-calculated wealth, were such a wealth tax to be
implemented. For example, they might find ways to transfer their wealth to
trusts, corporations, foundations, etc., and then "use" this wealth by
hiring themselves as high-priced consultants, providing "company cars" and
"company yachts."

(Arguably this already happens, with such corporate perquisites considered
part of the compensation package for many highly-paid executives.)

As to whether there are schemes for reducing the valuation of equities only
at certain times of the year, I can't think of any that would have a
significant effect. Deals to sell stock at artificially low prices are
frowned upon. As are "parking" schemes.
