Another possible monkey wrench is to send non-GAK messages containg random
data.  Since the entropy of encrypted and RNG data should be identical you
can always maintain the messages contain nothing at all and cannot produce
a decrypt key since none exists.

See above comment.

Another casuality could be anonymity.  Once GAK is in place, look for a
requirement for Clipper cards in order to access ISPs.
