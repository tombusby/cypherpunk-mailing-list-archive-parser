It was interesting how the Agent made the point that the FBI was there to 
enforce laws, not make policy.  Then his Boss's role in the law making process
was brought up, the Agent said "but any of you can do the same thing, you
all have a voice" etc etc.  Then he refused to answer political questions 
based on the fact that he was there as a representative of the FBI, failing
to see that his Boss is also a representative of the FBI when recommending
legislation.  (Again, I realize he was "under orders" not to discuss it, I 
wish he wouldn't try to justify it with obviously faulty logic.)

A more cynical view is that they are there to protect some of the biggest
institutions of "organized crime" (ie: Congress, At&t, Microsoft, etc) who
are ripping people off on a daily basis from the other organizations who
refuse to play by their rules.
