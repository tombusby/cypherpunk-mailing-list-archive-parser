One thing I've never heard is an explanation of how computer software and 
especially mathematics went from "extremely not patentable" in the early and 
middle 1970's, to "patentable" once Messr's Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman 
invented a piece of mathematics that the government wanted to deny to the 
public.  How convenient.

Coincidence?

Even if we accept the supposition that at some point, "they" decided for 
non-suspicious reasons to _start_ issuing patents on software and 
mathematics, I've never heard an explanation of how R, S, and A _knew_ to 
apply for a patent, long before the first software patent was issued, and 
even longer before the first pure mathematics patent was issued.  (which, 
was, probably, on RSA!)

Were these guys psychic or what?  Who told them what, and when?  Patents 
have to be applied-for within a year of disclosure, which means they had to 
decide whether to pay the money for a patent application that by historic 
standards could not possibly be issued.  Yet they did it anyway.

What's wrong with this picture?

Something tells me that given the unblemished history of non-patentable 
mathematics, RSA could never have withstood a patent challenge.  They had to 
have known this.

Implying that he's unwilling to do anything useful for free, which raises 
interesting questions about why he's bothering to  send his notes to me.  Is 
he being _paid_ for this?

Yet another misrepresentation.  The purpose of the risk-pooling is obviously 
to set a friendly precedent, and it does not require any "overt illegal 
acts," merely challenges to an overly broad interpretation of subpoena 
power.  Any siezure of ISP equipment would simply result in another "Steve 
Jackson Games"-type decision that would be expensive for the jurisdiction in 
which it occurred, and would further cement the precedent that the 
government couldn't do anything about.

In fact, one of the most obvious precedents that needs to be set is that the 
government has no right to sieze equipment from an ISP (and thus shut the 
ISP down) if all it wants is _data_.  Clearly, that's exceeding the bounds 
of what the government is realistically entitled to.  I think the most any 
ISP should be required to do is to present an encrypted version of all the 
system's data, and then the appeals process can start.  The government won't 
be able to use the data until the process is complete, months or years down 
the line.  Naturally, the fact that the information on the system is 
subpoenaed should automatically become public knowledge, because the data is 
already fixed and immutable.

And an ISP should NEVER be required to act as an agent for the cops, and in 
fact should be prohibited from doing so if his contracts with his customers 
certify he won't be.
