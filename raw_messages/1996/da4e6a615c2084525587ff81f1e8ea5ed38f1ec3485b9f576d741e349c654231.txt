I didn't initially use the the car-hire analogy, I was just trying to
bring it more into line with the anon-remailer situation.  Perhaps a
better example would be an agency set up for the sole purpose of hiring
cars on behalf of anonymous customers - as long as the customers didn't
abuse the anonymous facility too much, then I guess they would be allowed
to carry on operating, much like the remailers operate at present.
However, I guess they're in for trouble when their service starts being
abused at the expense of big brother, and I guess their policy of shredding
all evidence at weekends won't help matters either.

But this doesn't match the remailer scenario - this example is better
likened to me letting you use my email account whilst at my house.

Yes, but when was the last time someone physically mailed copyright source
code (eg RC2) to half the world?  When was the last time a pair of lawyers
made worldwide news due to making a phone call?
Again, the anon-postal-mail/anon-telephone-call analogy doesn't work.
