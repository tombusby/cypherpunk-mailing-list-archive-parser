The SCSI Zip drives do act as normal SCSI drives (though they have a limited
number of SCSI ids available. (5 & 6 if I remember correctly.) Later drives
may have this changed.)

The problems i am encountering are due to the _parellel_ version of the Zip
drive.  (I bought it because I needed to be able to visit customer sites and
not all of them have SCSI.)  The drivers fake a scsi port.  (Some laptops
use a similar driver to attach hard drives to non-scsi systems.)

Maybe I will just get a Jaz drive and not worry about it...
