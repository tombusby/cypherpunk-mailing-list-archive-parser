	democracy is _never_ the ideal government. the difference in the
    American government is that it is a _republic_.  the problem with a 
    republic in the techno age is that the press and/or advertising 
    creates the images --and can be bought, stolen, coerced, etc.

        my intent is to "lament" that the American voters do not 
    influence the choice of candidates --who are vetted my money, or 
    money's interests. 

        most mat not wish to consider the hidden importance of the CFR 
    and related groups --it is not a conspiracy; it is just another
    group with an agenda --except they have the money and influence to
    _buy_ the agenda over time --amd on their schedule.

Overseeing first-rate programmers is a managerial challenge
