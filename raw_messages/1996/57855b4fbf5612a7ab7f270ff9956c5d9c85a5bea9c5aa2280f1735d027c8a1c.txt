	Yes, it is censorship.  At least, it is if you aren't watching
every program on every channel available to you right now, because
your channel selection allows you to censor public/cable TV at will
right now, without the V-Chip.  What the V-Chip does is allow you to
censor what is shown on your television, even in your absence.  I'll
concede that there are positive aspects to this for parents, but I
resent the 'you must install it in all TVs' part. If enough people
want it, they can get TVs with it.

	The content information is transmitted as part of the program,
in the between-frame band which is normally not in the displayed area
of the picture, not on a separate signal.  (Now why can't they use
this band for something truely useful, like an automatic time sync and
VCRPlus ID, so that your VCR could pick it up, and know that VCRPlus
ID 69 is on channel 13, and is broadasting with a +2:30 skew from what
you think the time is?)  Because of this, there will be _one_ content
code, not a select-your-rater content method.

	The other reason for not having a select-your-rater method is,
first, the sheer volume of TV broadcasting.  No service could possibly
rate all TV content.  Second, no service could rate _live_ TV, such as
the nightly news, or post-game NFL locker room films.  My guess is
that the producer of a program will get first shot at putting a label
on a program, or not.  Then the distributor will be able to keep the
producers label, change it, add their own, or remove it.  This will
continue until the broadcaster gets to decide whether or not to
transmit a V-Code, and whether to use the last distributors label or
their own.  But do you really think that MTV will use a V-Code?  (It
could be amusing if they did - 10 minutes of blank screen, then 2
minutes of commercials when someone cranks all of their settings to
Full Filter.)

	Incorrect.  The 'V-Chip' exists (at least according to a
demonstration on NBC News ("Home of the Exploding Chevy") the other
night), there just isn't sufficient consumer demand for it to have hit
the market yet.  And, from appearances, it doesn't pixelate the
picture, it blocks the signal entirely.  They should at least have put
a 'Sorry, kiddies, you have to hack your parents passcode to see
this.' message up.  That's the weakness here - it was only a 4 digit
passcode locking the V-Chip level - does anyone really think that some
kid who wants to watch HBO or MTV isn't gonna cycle through the
numbers, even if it is only a few dozen at a time?  Or that there
isn't a reset mechanism for when Pop forgets the code and he really
wants to watch 'Showgirls' on PPV?
