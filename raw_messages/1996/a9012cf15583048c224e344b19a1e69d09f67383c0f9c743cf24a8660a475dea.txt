Political speech, not commercial speech.  The act doesn't apply or is
unconstitutional.

Of course.  Why do you think I said (in the 4th paragraph which you didn't
quote) (ZING :-) ):

BTW - I consider non-free markets, produced primarily by oligarchic
combines of large organizations to be a major impediment to removing
government influence from the economic system.  Easing market entry is one
way to reduce the power of these oligarchic combines.  I don't want to just
trade elected government oppression for unelected corporate oppression.  To
put it bluntly, to suppress the 19th century coal mining strikes, the
companies hired the Pinkertons.  I don't see a whole lot of difference
between this kind of private enterprise transaction, and Ruby Ridge.
