Edupage, 22 February 1996.  Edupage, a summary of news items on information
technology, is provided three times each week as a service by Educom, a
Washington, D.C.-based consortium of leading colleges and universities
seeking to transform education through the use of information technology.

	This is the first I've heard (I think) that theirs will allow
electronic cash. Wonder what exactly this means? 

>ELECTRONIC WALLET FROM ORACLE AND VERIFONE
>Oracle, which specializes in database software, and Verifone, which
>specializes in credit card verification systems, have formed an alliance
>that will allow customers using "electronic wallets" built into Internet
>browser software to access a full range of financial transaction methods,
>including credit and debit cards, smart cards and electronic cash.  The
>companies call it an "end-to-end" system for secure electronic commerce on
>the Internet.  (Financial Times 22 Feb 96 p16)

	Somehow, the cluelessness of governments sometimes amazes even me. Have

>TAX REVOLT ON THE INFO HIGHWAY
>When officials in Spokane, Wash. thought they could wring some extra revenue
>via a 6% tax on Internet providers, they were inundated with e-mail and
>phone calls protesting the action.  One firm even set up a Web site for
>users to vent their opposition.  The result was the city council decided to
>delay the tax pending further study, but the Spokane experience is likely to
>be played out in cities across the country as local governments look for new
>sources of cash.  (Information Week 12 Feb 96 p10)
