Does it have any identifying numbers?
NCR OEMed a line of ADDS Viewpoint terminals for a while,
and while the numbers no longer come to mind
(unless they're like 2920), they might look familiar
if I saw them.  This keyboard sample doesn't look
quite like them, though.  Most of their keyboards
like that were for terminals, not for PCs.
Are the connectors even PC-like?

Also, if there are function keys through F20, it might very
well be a 3270-emulator of some sort.
