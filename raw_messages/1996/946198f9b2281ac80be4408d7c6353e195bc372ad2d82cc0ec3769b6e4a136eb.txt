anonymizer has moved to www.anonymizer.com:8080 (hosted on c2.org.)
There's also the Great Web Canadianizer, if you don't mind reading
pre-hosed web pages, eh?   Anonymizer does a better job, fixing up
things like REMOTE-HOST, REMOTE-ADDR and HTTP-COOKIE which pass
some information about the originating system.  HTTP-DONUT, eh?

Also, Netscape 3.0 is a bit quieter than earlier versions.
