I have read it, a long time ago. Frankly, it's a spectacularly bad
example. He writes of the two child-protagonists gaining reputations as
great philosophers on a sort of Usenet. (At the time I believe OSC was a
member of Delphi, UNCLEORSON)
 
Look around on the real Usenet. OSC could not have been more wrong.

You don't seem to realize you are actually including at least one major
example of a counterfeit reputation here.
 
I speak of Siskel & Ebert, whom I have caught at least once giving a
strikingly dishonest review. I had seen the movie (See You In The
Morning) on opening day, before they reviewed it. It stunk. After the
credits rolled, the audience walked out in sullen silence, unable to
believe they had spent money to see it. Nobody in the entire audience
gave any sign of liking any part of the thing even a little bit. Whereas
they had been talkative and somewhat excited before it started. A few
days later, I saw S&E's review. One of them (Siskel, I think) raved and
raved about it. Perhaps he was the only person in the country who liked
it, but I don't believe that. He gave it a lengthy, raving thumbs-up.
Then the other (Ebert, I think) said "Well, I didn't like it as much as
you did", thumbs down, and *stopped*.
 
Conclusion: They knew it stunk, but for some reason I won't speculate on
they wanted to say they liked it so they misreported it, and covered
their butts with a review that would look mixed later but sound like a
rave now. I see a counterfeit reputation.

I'm tempted to tit-for-tat, but I will not refute your points by telling
you you just don't understand.

Fine, but resolving good vs counterfeit reputations takes time too.

How? I ask for something more specific than In The Future Everything
Will Be Done Right.
