That is correct. Sorry that the BTW-statement is so evident. Some people 
did not understand that if you *do* agree, then you *can* be breaking any 
rules...

I do not agree. For instance, the encryption possibilities of wordperfect, 
and MS-word are weak; my mail-system (ms-exchange) does not have any 
encryption at all. The security of these important Custom of The Shelf 
products can and will be enhanced..

The point is that public available systems should *aid* not them in their 
criminal activities, let them search for alternatives. Compare it with the 
legislation we have here on the sell of guns. You sort of say: hey, that 
does not help cause criminals will get it somewhere. I say, that is true, 
but it will make their lifes more difficult, or maybe I should say less 
easy.

Our system slows down criminals too, or maybe I'd better say does not speed 
them up.
Locking my house and my car, certainly limits my freedom too because it 
gives me
the risc of losing the key (happened a few times). Finding the middle of 
losing freedom by law-abiding citizens on the one hand and stopping 
criminals on the other hand is an important issue in any democracy. We 
believe our system gives a solution in which every democratic country on 
his own implement to their middle, without losing connectivity with 
countries that think otherwise.
