Thanks to Catfish Friend for the fine research work.

So how often are people prosecuted under these laws?  That is, if you
pay your taxes and don't steal from people, but do give your employer
the wrong SS number, what are the odds that you will be prosecuted?

If prosecuted, are the odds high that you will receive jail time?
Assume a good lawyer, spotless criminal record, and a favored
racial class.
