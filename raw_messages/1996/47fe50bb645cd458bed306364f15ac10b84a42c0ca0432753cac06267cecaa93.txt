I read Henry's question to refer to the case in which the Web page
author rates a page "too low"; that is, in such a way that despite the
use of RSAC/SurfWatch/etc. software, "undesirable" material gets
through the filter. 

Suppose that an author provides a page which lists, say, clothing-
optional beaches, complete with pictures.  The author rates it as
"suitable for family viewing" -- either naively, believing that no one
will be offended; or deliberately, to make the point that the content is
harmless and _should_ be considered suitable for family viewing; or
simply in order to widen the potential audience.

Henry's question (as I interpret it) is this: If prudish parents now
catch their kid looking at a page with pictures of barenaked people,
figure out why the page wasn't filtered out, and file suit against the
author, what is likely to happen?

ObCrypto, sort of:  What if the page were retrieved through an HTTP
proxy which, unbeknownst to the author (and the filtering service/SW),
deliberately removes or alters the PICS-Label or other rating
information?  The author did, after all, _provide_ the "undesirable"
material....  To what extent does the author's intent matter?  Must Web
authors now add a digital signature to each page (including its rating
info), to prevent tampering?

the tiniest shred of [Exon]ing responsibility for themselves and their
[Exon]ing kids?
