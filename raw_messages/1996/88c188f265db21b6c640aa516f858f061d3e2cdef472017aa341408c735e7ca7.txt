Obviously, we're taking "<user name> sucks" messages to a new level.
The author seems to be striving for some display of literary prowess,
albeit one that's a tad heavy on similes.

So that we can all save some time (why use valuable time to think of "you
suck" messages, when you can just have the computer build them for you?),
perhaps folks should take a look at the "Chomskybot" that's running at
"http://www.ling.lsa.umich.edu/cgi-bin/chomsky.pl".  Being familiar with
Noam Chomsky helps, but most everyone will see the value of what the site
has to offer.

By changing the initiating, subject, verbal and terminating phrases, the
Chomskybot should be able to provide exactly what's needed when trading
insults with other Cypherpunks.  We can have contests for "Best of Breed" 
(hell, we *already* have contests, it's just that nobody ever wins any
prizes), and "genre" categories based on upcoming events, holidays,
political headlines, etc.  Eventually, someone will link the Perl code
into procmail or cron, and we can have a new "<user name> sucks" message
automatically mailed to the list every few seconds by battling Cypherpunk
super-computer-powered "clans".  When enough automated insults fill the
list, human interaction will simply cease and then we can all enjoy the
enormous amounts of free time that we'll have since we won't actually
have to read anything any longer. 

So, we got any Perl programmers out there?
