Both Eric's product and PGPhone use Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  They
protect against man-in-the-middle attacks by displaying (part of) the
resulting symmetric key and having the phone's users verify they are both
working with the same key in the conversation.  Until the AIs/eavesdroppers
get good enough to imitate a person on the phone, this verification
technique is good enough.
