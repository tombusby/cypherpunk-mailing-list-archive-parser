No it was not SPAM.  John Gilmore attacked Vulis's style, plain

No it is not, asshole!  That is the old way of doing things.
It is NOW and always will be the "InterNet" -- I helped build the
motherfucker in 1969, I should know.

No, it is capitalized, because Grubor tells you.
The name is the GruBoursyNet.

I never would join that mailing list, because it is all a bunch
of shit.  The EFF must die, and that is all there is to it.

Look Tim, you ain't even on the IFC or the F-K lists, so
what the fuck do you care anyway?  Just go publish this shit
on UseNet, like Mr. Boursy says you should do, and stop
bothering our mailing lists.
