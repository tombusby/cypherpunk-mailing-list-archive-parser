No, I didn't say I was "cutting off all prediction of money appearing."   
But it would be a long shot from having particular donor's names associated 
with particular dollar figures.  And, the system would simply have to 
adjust.  Campaigns would have to adjust their spending to match the current 
realities, and donors would have to recognize that they're going to have to 
donate a bit earlier to accomodate the delay.

I'd prefer doing something far more...uh...permanent than to merely REPLACE 
officeholders.

"Firefighter's voting records"?  I _thought_ we had a secret ballot in this 
country.  Maybe you're from some  town that I don't know about!

Besides, what you're saying can be considered a bit of self-fulfilling 
prophecy.  Some cities ALWAYS vote one way, or another.  Over time, public 
employees simply adjust their politics to match their wallets, etc.  
Remember, these are PUBLIC employees after all, which really just means the 
employeees of the thugs who get into office.  It does not serve their 
interests to go against the winning candidate.  If, one year, the party 
normally out of office appears to be winning, the Firefighters will simply 
adjust their politics accordingly.  Simple.

Whichever candidate wins, "has sufficient numbers to win."  Tell me 
something else I don't know.

Size of government is evidence of the size of the corruption.
