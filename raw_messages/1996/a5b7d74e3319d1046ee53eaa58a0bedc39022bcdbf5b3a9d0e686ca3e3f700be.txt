What is described is not self-defence by any stretch of the imagination. It
is a pre-meditated act which causes any plea of self-defence to fail.

If it is wrong for an individual to kill another except in immediate
self-defence then it is wrong for any group of people to kill another
individual or group unless there is an immediate threat to the group.
Capital punishment by governments is wrong under any conditions. If you
seriously believe it is ethical for a government to kill another then please
answer me a simple question.

How many people have to decide that another should be killed for it to be
ethical? In short, how many people does it take to decide it is a legitimate
act to take your own life?
