        kickboxer is full of shit  --or trolling.
 
        since when can a jpeg or gif file viewer execute anything
    --nothing starts automatically, in any operating system.
    that is expecting a jump call of some sort.  we haven't yet 
    fallen into the impending insecure abyss of MS objects.
 
        to have a piece of code embedded execute, a "start-up" 
    program would need to be previously passed to the target 
    machine which literally scanned all memory for the startup
    sequence in the foreign material --and translate it.
 
        on unix, the code would need to be sophisticated enough 
    to remove itself from the process table --even in sleep
    modes.
 
        and, in any system, the startup sequence must be 
    readable, and therefore traceable by anti-virus routines.

        now that kickboxed has baited the hook for trolling, what
    new wet dream will we have for rebuttals?!?

you can fool all of the people some of the time,
  you can fool some of the people all the time,
    but you can not fool all the people all the time.
