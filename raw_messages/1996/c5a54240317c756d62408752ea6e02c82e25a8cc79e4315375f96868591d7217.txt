As Bryce addressed this to me as the primary recipient, I have to assume
he's ascribing these ideas to me.

I never said there is going to be a simple scalar rating. In my last major
post on this, several weeks ago, I even elaborated, saying that even
Alice's rating of Bob, for example, would have multiple components, such as
her rating of his taste in movies, his taste in restaurants, his political
beliefs, his technical expertise, etc.


This area is complicated enough to talk about with
oversimplifying-and-then-critiqueing. These are usually called "straw man"
arguments.
