Actually,  I just went through this.  I wanted scytale.net, but my ISP
rep was very upfront about my chances.  The .net is now reserved by
InterNIC for ISP's.  The .org domain is held for provable nonprofit
corps.  The .us domain was a possibility, but pragmatically impossible
due to the >4 month update latency in Minnesota.  Literally, the only
choice I had for a domain name was in the .com area.  It somewhat pissed
me off, since I really did not want my net.presence to look commercial.
