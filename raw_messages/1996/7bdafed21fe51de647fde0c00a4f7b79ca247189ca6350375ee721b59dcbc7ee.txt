Yes, Dr., this latest tripe that has spewed forth from Tim's keyboard 
reeks of bigotry.  And all this time I felt you may have been too 
hard on him.  This latest rant of his has made me reconsider your 
rough treatment of Mr. May.  I kinda think he deserves a slapping 
right now.

I find Mr. Mays comments quite racist and are quite off topic for 
this list.

I would much rather talk about what rights I have to do bulk, 
targeted e-mailings!  Or the fame of "The Spam King"  I saw him on a 
TV show called The Web on the SciFi channel.  This guy is a great 
example of the old adage that there is no such thing as bad publicity.

Just my two cents.  It's been too long since I last posted, but I was 
compelled to post about this racist crap.  I went to an inner-city 
school in South Gate, California and found it better to be friendly 
with anyone who would be my friend, despite the color of their skin.  
I went into the US Military and that idea was reinforced there.  So I 
hate to hear people who are unwilling to find humanity behind a 
darker color skin.  That just pisses me off!
