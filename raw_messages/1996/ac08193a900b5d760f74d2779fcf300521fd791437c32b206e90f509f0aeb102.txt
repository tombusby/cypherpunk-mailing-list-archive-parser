>   BONN (Sep 13, 1996 4:05 p.m. EDT) - Germany's Federal Prosecutor's
>   Office said on Friday it was investigating a number of so-called
>   Internet providers because they were giving computer subscribers
>   access to a radical left-wing electronic newspaper.
   
>   A spokesman for the office said the firms were suspected of inciting
>   criminal activity and advertising for a terrorist group because they
>   had failed to block access to the left-wing Internet page "radikal
>   154."
   
>   Among other things, the electronic site provides instructions on how
>   to sabotage railway lines. Prosecutors consider it to be terrorist
>   propaganda.
   
>   On Friday, the page was still available via major Internet providers
>   CompuServe Inc, AOL and T-Online, the online service of
>   telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom.
   
>   AOL said in a statement that it was technically impossible to block
>   the server where "radikal" originated, and that the page was anyway
>   now available via at least 30 other servers and in thousands of
>   electronic copies.
   
>   Authorities have been getting increasingly frustrated that radical
>   left- or right-wing material whose distribution is a criminal offence
>   in Germany can be picked up here on the Internet from computers in
>   foreign countries. The server where "radikal" originates is located in
>   the Netherlands.
