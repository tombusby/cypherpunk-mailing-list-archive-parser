For those who are curious, Indonesia is an interesting test case among the
Pacific Rim counties because the current iron-fisted ruler is beginning to
get a bit long in the tooth and no one has any idea what it going to happen
when he finally croaks.  Indonesia has had almost no political opposition
since a rather violent anti-Communist crackdown/coup in the 60s.  All media
access was rigorously controlled and the possibilities the Internet and
similar computer networking technologies offer (ObCryptoAnarchy ref...) are
just now becoming apparent to those who are in charge.  How this plays out
will have interesting reprecussions in other such countries where politicial
discourse is a new phenomenon and where the Internet is just now being seen
as a threat to the current order.

bloddy than Indonesia's last change of government...
