Life is short.

Get a life.

Of course you could simply spoof the identity of someone else 
in order send some exit mail.  use the port 25 trick. A parting 
shot will work wonders, by alerting others that their views are 
likely to be censored, thus discouraging them from posting on 
the list, thus causing the list to die, but if you actually 
put serious work into this and make a big effort to keep up 
a conversation and keep on going and going then you are a 
total loon.
