make this warning. Regrettably, my political views and financial condition
make me a potential target for prosecutors seeking to "set an example" as
well as to collect the $500,000 penalties for proving a violation of the
CDA. Hence my caution. Furthermore, quoted material may also contain
putatively indecent material, as the CDA makes much of ordinary speech a
felony if communicated by means of computer, so censorship of certain words
and ideas may be necessary.

This is of course an old idea. Regrettably, the CDA is not based on a
simple bright line test invovling the "Seven [exonized] Words,"
immortalized in the FCC--Carlin--Pacifica case. Rather, "indecent" is
broadly interpreted to mean essentially whatever a prosecutor can convince
a panel of bluenosed citizens is indecent.

In particular, the examples Blanc includes, which I have exonized to
protect myself from having to pay up to $500,000 in fines (and wouldn't you
guess that they'd love to make an example out of me...and collect from
me!), are still likely to be considered "indecent," as the allusions about
what Gingrich can do are still clear.
