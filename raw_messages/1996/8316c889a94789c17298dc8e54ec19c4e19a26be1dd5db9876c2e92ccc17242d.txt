I won't comment on who I will or won't hire.  I will state that I believe
that what a person posts is a relevant issue when it comes time to make a
hiring decision.  Hiring is based on many factors other than simply
technical ability. If someone thinks that another should not be hired for
whatever reason, I support their right to hold that belief and even to
publicize it.

I won't follow you into the gutter on this one.  That horse has been dead
for days (and it is beginning to smell really bad).
