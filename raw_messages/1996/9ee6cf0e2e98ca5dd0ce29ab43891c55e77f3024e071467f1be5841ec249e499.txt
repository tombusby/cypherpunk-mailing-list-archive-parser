Hey, that was my too-long sig, Ross.  There is obviously more than one
person who disagrees with your assertion that listing an email address
somewhere is an open invitation for mail to that address on any topic or
for any purpose.

Also, I charge $500 per message.  I've always liked flat fees. :-)

Interesting perspective.  However, placing an email address on a web page
is by no means an offer to take "comments" (i.e., marketing spams) on
anything that strikes the spammer's fancy.

The context in which any email address is mentioned will tell you what
sorts of messages are expected at that address.  To maintain otherwise is
just a flimsy excuse for "seedy low life multi-level-marketing jerks" who
want to cover their postage-due unsolicited advertising/promotional email
in some false cloak of respectability.

To continue the comment box analogy, the stuffing of salsa sample comment
boxes (next to the salsa sample booth in the grocery store) with ads for
anything you're pushing is most decidedly not what the comment box is for.
