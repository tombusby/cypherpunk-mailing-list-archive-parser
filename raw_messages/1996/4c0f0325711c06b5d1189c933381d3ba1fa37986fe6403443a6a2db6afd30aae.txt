Computer Encyclopedia & Computer Accessories are the fastest growing 
destinations on CCI.  If you haven't checked 'em out yet, see why others 
flock there. You can download a free WebPhone and browse the Computer 
Encyclopedia at

Used or refurbished equipment could be the way to go, especially 
considering how fast the technology changes.  Look for a new 
used/refurbished equipment buying service here in a few weeks.



Ten people will be selected at random from those who complete the ISP 
survey to win the top-rated DeskPorte 28.8S external modem from Microcom. 
Plus, you'll get the warm fuzzies knowing you helped us inform others 
about who's performing up to snuff, and who isn't.
