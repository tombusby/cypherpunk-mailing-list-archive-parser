This is getting off-topic,  if there is such a thing on this
list, but anyway... of course legislation alone is no good.
Typically, it is accompanied by efforts to provide alternate
livelihood to the older children or parents, free schooling, etc.

Take your point,  though we may be talking chicken and egg here.
If you have lots of children, you and your children never will
become rich enough to change...

Socialism as an economic philosophy is fairly discredited, and is
on its way out without my expressions of outrage needed to help
it along. Yet, the capitalist economy seems to be no better at
dealing with extreme poverty.
