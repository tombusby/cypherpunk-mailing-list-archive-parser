The question is whether you wish to be tortured by the Government forces or
the Peoples Revolutionary army.  (I guess is comes down to which side has
had more practice this week...)  Also, will this be deliberate torture or
the accidental kind.  ("Oops.  Sorry.  We were actually after a dully
elected representative of the four horseman.  You just got in the way.
Maybe it will grow back...")

This assumes that there are only two basic axises that rights are based
opon.  Some of those can get pretty fuzzy.  To properly describe how the
system works would require an n-dimensional hyperpolygon of indeterminate
size.  (Kind of like describing the black budget.  You know it is there,
but looking at it is difficult, and if they catch you looking the hounds of
tindalos will be coming at you out of every corner of the woodwork.)

Personally, I am a political non-euclidean.
