Then you need to read the license agreement:

1. Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") grants to you a
non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, license to use this Beta version of
the Netscape network navigator (the "Software"), in binary executable
form for evaluation and trial use purposes only.  THIS SOFTWARE
CONTAINS CODE THAT DISABLES MOST OF ITS FEATURES AFTER SEPTEMBER 17,
1996.

5. Title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to
the Software shall remain in Netscape and/or its suppliers.  You agree
to abide by the copyright law and all other applicable laws of the
United States including, but not limited to, export control laws.  You
acknowledge that the Software in source code form remains a
confidential trade secret of Netscape and/or its suppliers and
therefore you agree not to modify the Software or attempt to decipher,
decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Software, except to the
extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction.

6. Netscape may terminate this License at any time by delivering
notice
to you and you may terminate this License at any time by destroying or
erasing your copy of the Software.  Upon termination of this License,
or in any event within thirty (30) days following Netscape's release
of
a commercial version of the Software, you agree to destroy or erase
the
Software.  In the event of termination, the following sections of this
License will survive: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.  This License is
personal
to you and you agree not to assign your rights herein.  This License
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of California and, as to matters affecting copyrights,
trademarks
and patents, by U.S.  federal law.  This License sets forth the entire
agreement between you and Netscape.

8. You may not download or otherwise export or reexport the Software
or
any underlying information or technology except in full compliance
with
all United States and other applicable laws and regulations.  In
particular, but without limitation, none of the Software or underlying
information or technology may be downloaded or otherwise exported or
reexported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Haiti,
Iraq, Libya, Yugoslavia, North Korea, Iran, or Syria or (ii) to anyone
on the US Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals
or the US Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.  By downloading
the Software, you are agreeing to the foregoing and you are
representing and warranting that you are not located in, under control
of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list.
