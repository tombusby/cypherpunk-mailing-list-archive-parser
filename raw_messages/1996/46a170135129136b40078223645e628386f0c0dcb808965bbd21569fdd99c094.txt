Which "false and unrealistic claims"?


I am removing your name from the subscription list for

This isn't a DEBATE.  It is a WARNING to all other potential suckers in the 
Portland Oregon area that Alan Olsen engaged in highly unethical behavior 
with regards to the recent cypherpunks meeting, flamed me without 
justification in the national list, failed to respond to security inquiries, 
failed to deny issues and matters of truth, and failed to properly deal with 
a situation that he had a responsibility to handle ethically.  Not to 
mention lying in the comment above.

I am going to take this to the national list, because you took it there 
first in your original flame:  I am going to point out that you flamed me 
for no good reason; you engaged in a "knee-jerk" "debunking" without even 
knowing what you were ostensibly "debunking,"  that you failed to respond to 
my polite request for clarification; that you've attempted to pretend that I 
was somehow at fault for noticing your transgressions; that your local 
clique is pre-programmed to defend you in the face of your transgressions.  
I notice that some of them don't even know what a key-signing meeting is 
FOR:  I've received commentary which suggests that they believe that 
key-signing somehow vouches for the HONESTY of the person involved; not his 
IDENTITY.

Until you start responding substantively to legitimate complaints, that is 
all you deserve.  The public needs to be warned about people like you.
