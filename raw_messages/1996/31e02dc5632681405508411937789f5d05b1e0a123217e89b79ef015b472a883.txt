The Future of Consumer Electronic Payments:  The Impact on the Distribution
Chain

Gregory Schmid, Institute For The Future

        This talk explores the critical changes pushing consmers into the
world of electronic transactions--improved technologies, better security,
and consumers' growing experience with card-based and other electronic
transaction technologies.  These changes will not only affect customer
behaviors, but will transform the distribution chain, bring in new players,
force the current players to fundamentally transform the way they conduct
business, and encourage policymakers to find the right balance of
regulation and market forces.
        Combined, these impacts will change the basic relationship between
businesses and their customers forever.  Only the stakeholders who are
prepared for such changes will carve out their place in the new world.

are located in the Stanford Research Park, between Page Mill Road (west of
Foothill Expressway) and Hillview Avenue.  The easiest way to get here is
to take Page Mill Road to Coyote Hill Road, and, as you drive up Coyote
Hill between the horse pastures, PARC is the only building on the left
after you crest the hill.  Please park in the large (lower) lot to your
right; enter the auditorium at the upper level of the building.  (The
auditorium entrance is located to the left of the main door and down the
stairs.)
