I don't think any decent programmer has never tried such an aproach to crack
for example PKZIP archives (the one on CD-ROMs, where you have to pay to get
the passwords). I certainly did back in 1991. I don't want to put down the
usefullness of such a program, but since probably more than 50% of all
passwords are vulnerable to dictionary attacks, such a utility has not too
much value. (have you ever tried all combinations from "aaaaaa" to "zzzzzz"
(there are around 2'176'782'336 <36^6> if you concider all umlauts like the
German auml;, uuml;, ouml;, ...). On the other hand, there won't be much
more than 10'000 6-letter words in any dictionary.

So it seems, a wordlist generator and a wordlist using cracker works a lot
better (and is almost as trivial to do - if you keep aside nice features)
