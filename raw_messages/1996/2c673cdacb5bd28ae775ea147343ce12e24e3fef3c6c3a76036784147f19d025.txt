SCOOPS AND TOP STORIES


GORE GETS AN EARFUL FROM CYBERMOGULS ON ENCRYPTION POLICY
Al Gore, the ultimate information highway cheerleader, won't like
what he sees in his in-box: stern criticism of the White House's
encryption policy. The Business Software Alliance's letter says
Bill and Al are heading in the "absolute wrong direction." But
giving is better than receiving (it is, after all, the holidays),
and the industry group offers five ways out of the morass.

STEVE JOBS TELLS TECH CROWD, "IT'S THE CONTENT, STUPID!"
The man who helped launch the computer revolution of the 1980s is
now exhorting creative types to take their rightful place at the
digital table. Citing blockbuster films Toy Story, Jobs preached
that only the combination of technology AND creativity will get
the consumers' juices flowing.

MICROSOFT'S BALLMER TAKES VERBAL DIGS AT NC HAPPY COMPETITORS
Perhaps you thought Microsoft was worried, or at least cranky,
about all the predictions Ellison and company have been making
about the network computer dethroning the PC as machine du jour?
Not at all. In fact, says Steve Ballmer, "it's fantastic!"
