Then I caution you to review the program 'Crack'.  Crack comes with two sets
of  rules with which it mutates the words from two separate dictionaries.
Things like:  replace 'i' with 'y', 's' with '$', 'e' with '3', change
capitalization to pattern AbCdE, etc.  Typically, there is an extensive set
of rules (I remember 47) that perform more "morphing" of a shorter "hot"
dictionary list, followed by a common subset of the rules applied to the
entire dictionary.  The shorter dictionary list I remember seeing contained
an extensive list of female first names, common computer "words" such as
foo, bar, etc., and even some Klingon and Elvish words.  These words were
subjected to extensive letter shifting, case changing, and substitutions.
The balance of the dictionary was subjected to the simpler subset of rules
(22, I believe) regarding substitution, reversal of letters, capitalizing
the first and/or last letters, suffixing a single non-alpha character, etc.

I know a rather paranoid sa who used to think he had secure passwords
because he'd look around for some "word" of some random object nearby, then
transmogrify some letter (typically substituting 'y' for 'i').  Crack found
him out in very short order.

The reason I post this is that these word lists are invaluable to the Crack
operator.  *ANY* knowledge that reduces the search space can render the
security useless.  For example, if a Crack operator learns that you once had
a password of "any0ne", he or she will make sure to include a rule
substituting zero for 'o' in both dictionaries, they will probably make an
effort to emphasize letter-to-number substitutions of the words in their
dictionary, and maybe even focus less (or at least test last) on other
attacks, such as case-changing or number-suffixing.  Those
"easily-remembered personal rules" to which you refer can catch you pretty
quickly.

Harder is not NP-hard.  It's a very very long way away from NP-hard.

A "pretty large" dictionary is still much! smaller than brute force.  And
even if it is the precursor to brute-force, it's still a better starting
point than 
0x00000000000000, if you have reason to believe that it's based on an ASCII
password.

Just remember the old joke:  entropy ain't what it used to be.  And every
generation of faster processor that arrives makes this statement more
relevant to cryptanalysis.
