In fact, they basically already practice it. Not with computers, of course,
but in terms of not reporting cash income, not reporting tips, engaging in
barter work with others, and gambling in various non-sanctioned markets.

(Numbers games and sports betting are huge markets. Interestingly, such
markets also validate much of what we say about "reputations." After all,
when was the last time you heard about a bookie being sued in court for not
paying up? And private justice is administered, as welshers are disposed of
directly, without a  long, expensive trial. Nearly everything in "crypto
anarchy" has direct parallels in "underworld and black markets." Some say
they are really the same thing. Perhaps.)

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
