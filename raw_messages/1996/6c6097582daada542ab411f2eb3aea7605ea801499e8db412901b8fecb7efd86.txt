The way I see it:  if you narrow your targeting, by research, you can 
send SPAM to people who may really have a need for your products and 
services.  I send spam.  I am very apologetic, but I send only to 
software manufacturers.  I sell software media and duplication, so 
most software makers can relate to a request for me to quote on their 
needs.  BUT I OBJECT to spamming of usenet, and my mailing lists that 
I read.
