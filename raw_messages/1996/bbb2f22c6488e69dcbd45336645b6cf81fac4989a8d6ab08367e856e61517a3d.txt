	Could you give me a cost estimate for keeping video of the
last 10 minutes of 250 million lives?  This is essentially one of
Brin's suggestions, and it strikes me as astoundingly pricey, even if
you just consider the cost of cameras, fiber, switches, and vcrs, and
ignore the problem of deciding what tape to keep.

	Some back of the envelope leads me to over a trillion,
figuring that a second of video takes 10kb, and disk costs about
$50/mb.  250m cameras at $40 each, fiber connections at $400 each,
etc.
