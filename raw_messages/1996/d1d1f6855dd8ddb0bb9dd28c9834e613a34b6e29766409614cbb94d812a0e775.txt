This is true, but basically back to front.  Certain common forms of repressive
economic policy cause poverty.  From time to time political convulsions change
this policy for a long period.  If the period is several decades, development
follows.

In the past, popular support for these repressive policies was vast and 
overwhelming, and once in place they could only be changed by fairly 
murderous dictatorships, for example South Korea and Chile.

Popular support for these policies is still substantial, but has steadily 
diminished.

In my opinion this diminishing support is largely the result of 
improved international communications.  When people in poor countries 
discover that their social order is radically different from that in 
similar rich countries, they are apt to vote for institutions similar 
to those in the rich country -- the JR Ewing affect.

In short, the third world it has become considerably easier to create
liberty without the need to massacre real, suspected, and imaginary
communists.
