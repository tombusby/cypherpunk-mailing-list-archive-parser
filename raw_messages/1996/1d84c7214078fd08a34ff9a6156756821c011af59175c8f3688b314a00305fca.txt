This is from the DOJ report on the Ruby Ridge shooting:

"Weaver first came to the attention of the BATF in July 1986 during its
investigation of a series of bombings in Coer d'Alene, Idaho in which the
Aryan Nations was believed to be involved. BATF asked Kenneth Fadeley, a
confidential informant, to assist its investigation by obtaining information
about people attending an upcoming World Aryan Congress who might be engaged
in illegal activities.[FN23] Thereafter, Fadeley portrayed himself as a
weapons dealer who catered to motorcycle gangs and, in this role, managed to
be introduced to high level members of the Aryan Nations in Northern
Idaho.[FN24]

In July, 1986, Fadeley attended the World Aryan Congress at Hayden Lake,
Idaho. During this assembly, Fadeley was introduced to Weaver, who was at
that time of no particular investigative significance to BATF.[FN25]"

Weaver may have just been attending the World Aryan Nations Congress for the
beer and chicks...
