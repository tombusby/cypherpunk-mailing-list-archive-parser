But of course.  But what I want to know is: is there some 
combination of 
display colors that will be visible for the eye, but not for the 
Tempest equipment?

That might answer it.  I suppose that if some "stealth" settings 
exists, they are highly hardware dependent.  

My question was not "would it work in all instances?" but rather
"had this tactic been implemented successfully in *some* instances?"


Or, to the contrary, is it reasonable to assume that modern Tempest equipment can
work around theses impediments almost all of the time, therefore 
making any attempts at this futile?
