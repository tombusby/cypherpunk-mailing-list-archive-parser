I know they are getting scarce.  I just find the "let's sell IP addresses on
the open market" do be a scary though.  it will make them less available.

A good point. Having parts of subnet shifting around could be pretty painful
from an admin point of view.

I just hope that the AT&T scheme does not get put into place.  Otherwise it
will be just viewed like a stock split.  ("Wow!  We have more addresses to
sell!")

The AT&T plan as described sounds like something dreamed up by a marketing
droid as a way to "Make Money Fast Off Of The Internet".

What is the timeline for implementation of IPv6?
