AOL TRIES TO PLAY "THE PRICE IS RIGHT" WITH CUSTOMERS
As if he didn't have enough to worry about--blackouts, churn, the growth of
the Web--Steve Case and friends are also wrangling with attorneys generals
in 17 states. The problem is AOL's new pricing policy, which can be summed
up as: "Unless you say 'no,' your rate goes from $9.95 to $19.95." At pixel
time (previously "press time"), the skirmishes were just beginning.

MICROSOFT CATCHES UP TO ITS OWN BROWSER IN MACLAND
Explorer for Mac users rejoice! Your hybrid platform/browser choice has just
been significantly enhanced by the arrival of Microsoft's Java Virtual
Machine. Some of the Web's most bleeding-edge firms are now rushing to
embrace this new entrant into the market.

GATES & GROVE PROVE GREAT MINDS THINK AND CLINK ALIKE
First his friend and business buddy Bill Gates misses, then frantically
swerves to catch, the opportunities of the exploding Internet market. Now
Intel chief Andy Grove seems to have jumped into an exploding market late
enough to possibly fall off. Ironically, the product at the center of this
battle is Windows CE, made by none other than Microsoft itself.

IT PUTS THE WHOLE...WORLD...IN YOUR LAP
People will buy 190,000 of them this year and 4.1 million by 2000. They come
in 20 varieties and move four times faster than analog modem speeds. It fits
in your pocket, but can take you thousands of miles in seconds.

DESPITE IPO MISHAPS, TECH FIRMS STILL GETTING VC $$$
You've heard about Wired canceling its IPO. Twice. You've heard that the
VC-money-for-neat-Net-ideas bubble has burst. You've heard about apocalyptic
traffic jams that could choke the Web. But to get the real story on how
investors and venture capitalists feel about Net-related firms nowadays, the
old adage of "follow the money" yields interesting results.
