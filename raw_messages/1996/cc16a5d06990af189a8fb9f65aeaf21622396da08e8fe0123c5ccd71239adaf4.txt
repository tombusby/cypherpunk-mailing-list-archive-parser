Actually, I think your argument self-destructs.  Tim May is right.  If you 
take solace in the fact that "most mainstream Jewish groups *love* [you] 
right now," then that strongly implies that this fact (assuming, for the 
purposes of the argument, that your claim is true: you are loved) indicates 
that Jewish groups have some sort of strong input into who Germany 
prosecutes.  This implies a political friend/foe system, which is EXACTLY 
the kind of indeterminacy that Tim May  (and many other people) are worried 
about.   Consider the position of a "new" person who isn't on the 
"mainstream Jewish groups radar" (either positive or negative) the way you 
claim to be.   The implications of your statement is that HE would have to 
WORRY.  YOU would be SAFE!

Doesn't this bother you a bit?
