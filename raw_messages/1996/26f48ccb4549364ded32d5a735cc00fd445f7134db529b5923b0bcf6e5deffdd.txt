Probably.

You didn't read very carefully.  I'd hardly call the modest efforts I made
extreme.  This was the entire point.  If explaining my successes with
moderate efforts so that others might duplicate it (I think that apathy is
why more nyms [like yours] are unsuccessful as privacy tools) then how is
that self-indulgent?

You fail to not that dissociating one identity from another requires the
existence of two identities.  Is the second any less entitled to
protection than the first?

No.  That is the pseudo-cpunk attitude.

The real cypherpunks attitude can be illustrated thusly:

Two men are walking down a street, a psychologist and an economist.  They
happen along on a $100 bill.  Thinking he will evaluate the response of
the economist, the psychologist ignores the clearly visible bill.  To his
surprise the economist ignores it as well.  On asking the economist why he
did not pick up the bill, the psychologist recieves this answer:

"If it was really a $100 bill, someone would have picked it up already."

An old joke, but it makes an important point.  It is not enough to know
how the market system works, but also to participate it.  This is why I
believe using those legal tools that are available is an important step.
There is no morality other than the morality of the market.  I submit that
we do not need a central authority to dictate morality.  We need only
individual views of morality.  There will only be as large a pornography
market as there is a demand.  Ditto for narcotics, guns.  If the market
believes that porn is immoral, customers, by their own moral decision,
will reduce the market to nothing.  Of course this will not happen
in the near future because the cost of this moral choice exceeds the
benefit for many customers.

Why is use of the legal system any different?  If it is so wrong for me to
use the legal system as it stands, and if I am to be the subject of
criticism for the conduct, then aren't the critics imposing their moral
view on me?  Isn't this what libertarian cypherpunks dislike in the first
place?

The bottom line is that the decision to sue is much like the decision to
use a legal tax loop.  I would call "idiot" the person who refused to
utilize that which the government hands him. (Did not Mr. May indicate
that the $1000.00 or so that the government would hand him was too costly
to lose, even in the face of estlablishing privacy for his children?  In
my view that is a rational decision.  Mr. May has priced privacy.  My
objection to his rationale was that I think the cost of obtaining it can
be significantly lower).

If the government is going to hand me the means to curb conduct which may
be harmful to me, why should I refuse to use it on some "moral" grounds.
(The moral grounds might consist of "well it's not a nice thing to do." 
but other than that, I am at a loss to identify them precisely).

I submit that if law suits are so harmful and create such loss, eventually
they will be eliminated by one of several mechanisms.

Cypherpunks that they might speed the process by using that entitlement
which the government gives them.
