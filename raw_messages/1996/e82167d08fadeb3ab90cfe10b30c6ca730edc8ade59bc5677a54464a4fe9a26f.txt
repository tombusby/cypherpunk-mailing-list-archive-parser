	It currently appears that both groups doing PICS ratings are doing it
in a way that very much promotes unethical usage (by those wishing to control
content). This does not bode well for future uses of it.

	However, one can do things to disrupt the rating system. Until we've
got true AI, a web spider will be able to find and classify a newly-re-URLed
page a lot faster than the rating people are able to find it - especially if
one goes ahead and submits the web page to all the search engines every time
you reclassify it. A search engine could turn over all new pages to be rated -
but that would slow them down a lot, and other search engines would be used
more because they'd be more up to date.
	If you have some ratings services that you like - market-determined
ones, for instance - you can let them know the new URL also.

	The above is a bit harder for ratings of USENET posts and mailing list
messages, but there are so many of those that they'll be hard for a rating
service to keep up with.
