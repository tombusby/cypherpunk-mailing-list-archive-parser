Actually, at this point I don't think it would be inappropriate to remind
you two debaters (as well as the rest of the people here) that part of the
implications of my "Assassination Politics" idea is that it would
automatically force the elimination of all heavy weapons including nuclear,
down perhaps to handheld rifles.

 I am a 2nd amendment absolutist:  I believe that I have the right to
possess any and all "arms," including nuclear, biological, and chemical, as
well as all convention armaments.

There is no contradiction here.  

BTW, Rich, I hope you saw my recent comment wherein I praised you for your
principles and courage concerning the "Zundelsite" situation.  Perhaps I
originally judged you in haste.  While possessing no sympathy (even strongly
negative sympathy) for Nazi and Neo-Nazi (and Holocaust revisionist)
propaganda, I have similarly low opinions of censorship of all kinds.

My knowledge of this is hazy, however.  Consider this the beginnings of what
may be a profound and sincerely felt apology.
