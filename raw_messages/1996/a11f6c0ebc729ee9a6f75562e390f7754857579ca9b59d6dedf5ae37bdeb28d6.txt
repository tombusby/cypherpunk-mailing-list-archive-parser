	In addition, what if the material is edited down to try to conform to
fair use, as I do? First, you're still going to find it using the search
engines - and will have to filter it out. Second, the hoster of the data, if
locatable, will have to decide whether to respond to a legal threat and delete
something that may be within such guidelines. Third, such guidelines may vary
from country to country.

	To what degree could a remailer sense that its remailings are getting
too predictable (susceptible to traffic analysis)? If it had some means of
doing so (without keeping enough information to make subpoenaing it a
profitable proposition), then it could do something like the random
looping-back remailer chains, on an automatic basis to the degree needed to
offset analysis.
