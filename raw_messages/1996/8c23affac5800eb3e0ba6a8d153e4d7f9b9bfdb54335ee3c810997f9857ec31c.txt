I too have heard a lot of bullshit on this mailing list with no basis in
reality.

Suppose a vendor sells (or gives away) a software product, say, a front end
to POP3/SMTP, or a secure filesystem for WinNT, with hooks to crypto
routines in a DLL (or a shared library). The vendor bundles 2+ crypto
libraries with the product, publishes the API for plugging in 3rd party
libraries, and makes a diligent effort to limit key size to, say, 16 bits.

Later a strong library becomes available from overseas (perhaps a PGP
interface.) and it turns out that the key size limitation sort of doesn't
work (e.g. disallows keys from 17 to 127 keys but allows 128+). "Sorry,
officer, a bug in our program!"

Is USG going to risk a test case on the vendor?

Suppose an organization deploys (weak) crypto and establishes policies and
procedures for distributing keys, for ensuring that all that needs to be
encrypted is, for clearing plaintexts, etc. Suppose one day it becomes
dissatisfied with the weak crypto package and replaces it by a stronger one.

How much of the time and effort invested in deploying the weak package will
be directly transferrable?

Don promotes the use of crypto. I have no idea what exactly he's selling.
I haven't been paid to review it. :-)

"Cypher punks" are doing an evil thing not by exposing the alleged weaknesses
in Don't proposal (I have no idea if they're there or not, and I don't care).
"Cypher punks" such as Paul Bradley verbally abuse Don and turn this mailing
list into a laughing stock for the media. Putting "(spit)" after Don's name
and calling him "bullshit master" is not the same as exposing weaknesses in
his proposal.
