Apparently Jim does not understand that the "race for profit 
margin" is what LOWERS the prices of goods and services.  You 
might check out HUMAN ACTION by von Mises.  Anyway, as I said in 
my previous post.

I'm confident that the market solution would be far cheaper and
less violent they injecting the coercive state apparatus into a
volutary transactions between PEOPLE.

So?  They are owned and operated by people.

Made and enforced by PEOPLE.  Jim is begging the question.

couldn't be much more rudimentary.  (Okay, it was a cheap
