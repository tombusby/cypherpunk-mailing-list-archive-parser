How many gigs is the legendary SternBot Killfile by now?  Do you
use a RAID array?

Librarians have no role to "manage" anyones reading.  They are
there to assist patrons in locating the materials of their
choice. The Library "Bill of Rights" does not specify ANY age
limits for services provided to library patrons.

Again, librarians have better things to do than to peep over the
shoulders of library patrons.  Even tiny library patrons.

You are the one who mentioned Piaget.  Had you read my original
message accurately, you would have seen that unlimited access to
information was recommended once persons had entered their
teenage years.  There was no suggestion that very young children
should be given access to material they might find disturbing.

No, actually it has to do with attempts by parents and religious
agitators to control what young people may see in a library, like
taking "Playboy" off the periodical rack, for instance, and
requiring it to be signed out from behind the counter by those
over 18.  Such attempts have increased in number in recent years,
and some have actually been successful.

Stating that very young children may require some guidance in
their choice of reading and viewing material is not a statement
that older minors should also be interfered with in this regard.
Your suggestion that this is implied because it is an example of
tailoring material to age, of which the first is also an example,
is a clear case of incorrect abstraction from the general to the
specific.

The original sentence was...

  "While limiting the "horizons" of persons in their middle to
   late teens is often justified by arguments about
   developmental stages, the truth is that it is simply an
   attempt by their keepers to control how they think and to
   what views, mostly political and social in nature, they are
   exposed."

Seems quite clear to me.

Fortunately, there is no need to "Plonk" you David, because the
time required to hit "delete" on your messages is an
infinitesimal fraction of the time you waste writing them, and
like most trained animals, you do occasionally manage to do
something that amuses, even if it is only relieving yourself on
stage. :)
