BRUSSELS -- FICS Group, an international banking systems company,
announced a major electronic delivery initiative based on Microsoft
Corp.
technology.

Expanding on the personal computer and telephone modes of banking
service
delivery, FICS said it is expanding into smart phones, personal digital
assistants and
wireless phones, electronic wallets, and Internet-based services.

Microsoft platforms play a major role in FICS offerings, and Microsoft's
Activex
technology will be employed in Internet development.

"The fact that FICS has chosen Windows NT as one of its key development
platforms and adheres to the Open Financial Connectivity standard makes
the
company a valuable partner for Microsoft," said Ashley Steele, the
Redmond,
Wash., software company's marketing manager for the banking industry.

FICS also participates in the Tandem Computers Inc. "payments factory"
program,
also based on Windows NT.

Separately, FICS said it entered into a strategic partnership with
Swift, the global
banking telecommunications network. As a Level 3 partner, FICS is one of
a few
select firms that exchange strategic information with Swift and promote
each other's
products.
