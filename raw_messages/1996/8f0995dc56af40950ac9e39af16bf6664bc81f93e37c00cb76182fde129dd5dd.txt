I disagree.  The methods of timing (how to sample a specific timer) 
and the various interactions  that generate the entropy *are* system 
specific.  Code written for Suns won't work on PCs or Amigas or Macs, 
etc.  The implementation would probably be better if it were built 
into the OS, which rules out Win95, DOS, OS/2, Macs, etc. (unless the 
companies decide to add such a feature...)

Good question. You'd need to look for patterns.  Barring none, you'd 
have to guess the factors that lead to the entropy, and then see if 
there's a way to reverse-engineer it. (Perhaps use a stripped down 
system and build it up, or disable some of the hardware and OS 
features etc.)

Another question: how do you estimate entropy?
