I've been ignoring most of these quibbles about the definition of "byte"
and when it came about, etc., but the debate never seems to end.

I went to the Jargon File (aka The Hacker's Dictionary), where a nice
online version resides at http://beast.cc.emory.edu/Jargon30/JARGON.HTML


This is what I found:


byte


: /bi:t/ [techspeak] n. A unit of memory or data equal to the amount used
to represent one character; on modern architectures
this is usually 8 bits, but may be 9 on 36-bit machines. Some older
architectures used `byte' for quantities of 6 or 7 bits, and
the PDP-10 supported `bytes' that were actually bitfields of 1 to 36 bits!
These usages are now obsolete, and even 9-bit bytes
have become rare in the general trend toward power-of-2 word sizes.

Historical note: The term was coined by Werner Buchholz in 1956 during the
early design phase for the IBM Stretch computer;
originally it was described as 1 to 6 bits (typical I/O equipment of the
period used 6-bit chunks of information). The move to an
8-bit byte happened in late 1956, and this size was later adopted and
promulgated as a standard by the System/360. The word
was coined by mutating the word `bite' so it would not be accidentally
misspelled as bit. See also nybble.
