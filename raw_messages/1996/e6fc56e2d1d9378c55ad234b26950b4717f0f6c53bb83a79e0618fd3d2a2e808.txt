C'punks,

The February Bay Area Cypherpunks meeting will start at noon in
downtown San Francisco.  The address and directions are:

The meeting will be on the fourth floor of 388 Market St.  The 
building is bounded by Market, Pine and Front (Front is the
north-of-Market extension of Fremont St.)  There are numerous
parking garages in the area.

You will have to sign in at the security desk in the lobby.  You
need to indicate that you are going to "Simple Access" on the
4th floor.  After you get off the elevator there will be signs
directing you to the conference room.

388 is above the Embarcadero BART and Muni Metro station.  Other
public transit links exist from the Transbay Terminal and the
Caltrain Depot.  If you have any questions about how to get to
the meeting, let me know.  If you are driving:
