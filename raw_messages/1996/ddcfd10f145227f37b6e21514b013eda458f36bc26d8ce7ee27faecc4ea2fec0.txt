Read Ernest Hua's message from yesterday about this. He quoted an EE Times
article which said, in part:

 Cryptography buffs have been waiting for relief in the form of the
 third edition of James Bamford's classic The Puzzle Palace, on the
 workings of the NSA. The new edition is supposed to contain material
 from co-author Wayne Madsen detailing NSA presence at Internet
 switching centers, and cipherpunks have been disappointed that the
 book didn't meet its June release date. Rumor has it that squabbles
 between the two authors and the publisher may push the book out well
 into 1997.
