There are at least three shapes of wheel readily available.

Some of the keyservers have had finger interfaces; there was one on
wasabi.io.com for a while, though it may be inactive.  John Perry
may know where to find source code for it?  Assuming you want PGP keys
delivered in ASCII format, finger protocol should work just fine - you could
easily enough hack your own fingerd server to live on the fingerd port,
which gets PGP key files from a directory or database instead of from
users' home directories, and run it on pgp.northgrum.com or whatever.
You could even hack the existing finger code from {Free,Net}BSD,
making sure to clean up any remaining sprintf()s and {*}get()s.

Alternatively, a CGI query _is_ an easy way to do it, and there's
existing code on the MIT keyserver that's blazingly fast.

John Gilmore's SWAN project is using a DNS-based PGP key server;
check out http://www.cygnus.com/~gnu/swan.html for more details.

Three out of four ain't bad, and Detweiler's been using his alias on
the list for a couple of years and acting quite civilized :-)
Some good reading sources are Bruce Schneier's book "Applied Cryptography"
and Tim May's "Cyphernomicon" piece which is on the web somewhere.
Also, asking for pointers to existing work does categorize you
with the clueful minority.....
