Hello,

        My name is Christopher Drake, I own the company NetSafe.  We
        manufacture and sell one product - NetSafe - which prevents one
        small but universally unadressed, serious problem in computer
        security:  We prevent passwords (etc) from being stolen with
        Key Press Password recorders (KPPRs).

        My interest in this list is to stay up-to-date with the industry.

        You may recently have heard of the First Virtual announcement re:
        credit card number theft via automated means: our software specifically
        prevents this.

        Full details can be found at    http://pobox.com/~netsafe

        Interested parties from the recent cypherpunks meeting might
        like to note my public key: after the discussion I finally did it :-)
