SCOOPS AND TOP STORIES


JANUARY TRADING OFTEN A MICROCOSM OF THE YEAR TO COME
For 40 of the last 45 years, all bear markets began or continued
with losing or below-average Januarys, while the best market years
all had above-average Januarys. In today's Perspectives feature,
California Technology Stock Letter Editor Michael Murphy analyzes
what trends investors should look for during this bellwether
month.

IT'S JUST NOT AN ONLINE AD, IT'S A PURCHASE ORDER TOO
File under: "Oh, so THAT'S where all the money is going to come
from." Ted Leonsis of AOL predicts that a revolutionary breed of
transaction-enabled advertisements will bring billions of dollars
in ad revenues to the Net in the near future. He also opines that
these new hybrids will make today's "banners and buttons" obsolete
by 1998.

CHASING GATES, ORACLE'S ELLISON FINDS SOMEONE CHASING HIM
Larry Ellison, who has portrayed himself as a Microsoft-slayer
with his vaunted vision of the Network Computer, is himself facing
a challenge, this time on Oracle's traditional home ground.
Informix's Phil White is hoping that his new product will make his
company the king of the database hill.

SYBASE FINDS A SUGAR DADDY, AND THE MARKET RESPONDS
Although formerly number-two database maker Sybase has suffered
three consecutive quarterly losses, things might finally be
looking up for the troubled firm. The company's stock, which had
been virtually flat for more than a month, rose in response to the
news that renowned financier George Soros was bringing in the
cavalry.
