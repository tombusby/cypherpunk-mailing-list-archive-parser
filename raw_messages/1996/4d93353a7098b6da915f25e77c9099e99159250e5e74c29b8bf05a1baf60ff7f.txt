This is a terribly important point. If the "universal access" scheme is
approved and deployed, it gets the government back into the regulation of
the Net business. (I'm speaking of the "regulation of the Net" of the sort
that existed some years back, when "appropriate use" (scientific,
technical, educational, etc.) was the watchword, and casual chatter, GIFs,
etc. were called "inappropriate" by some.

The Constitutional issues of free speech would remain mostly unchanged even
if "universal access" happens, but the government would definitely get more
of a foot in the door than it has now.
