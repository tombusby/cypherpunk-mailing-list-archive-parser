    well, I class out as a Generation 1, born before the war --as a 
    multi-disciplined generalist.  during the 70s and 80s, we sat 
    in the king's chair when they need us. by the late 80s and in 
    the 90s, all they want are narrowly focused specialists, ignoring
    the generalist concept of overview and understanding the "big 
    picture. we are considered too broad to understand the high tech...  
    --and obsolete. 

    I used to call most of my contracts "on the job training"  --but 
    the point of a generalist is the ability to comprehend the narrow 
    field and separate the bullshitters and space-shot dreamers from 
    the doers.  just who on that team can cooperate well enough to
    get it out the door when it is months (or years) behind.  it was
    the last legal stand of the man with a mask and gun.

    My only complaint is that generation 1 generalists were dead about 
    five years too soon --unless you were Gordon Moore, etc.  those of 
    us who were cowboys --the last and best gunslingers in the West; 
    we were passe. I never once in my 35 year career collected a W2 
    wage, (and sometimes none in any form --feast or famine).

    Tim May probably pulled off the best of all gigs --on the Intel
    wagon as it went down, with stock options which gave Tim full
    independence in his low forties.

    I may not have much of a pot to piss in, but it was one long
    rockin' and rollin' ride  --basket to hell and all. you don't 
    look back, you just slam the throttle forward --same way I fly 
    stunt planes or hang from the apes of my hawg.  

    several of my five children are true generalists. have I (am I)
    advised them to go the route of the cowboy --not on your life! 

    but I certainly do not recommend engineering in any form --they 
    would be bored out of their squashs and in-trouble/restless all 
    their lives.  I encourage academia --the last refuge of the 
    absent-minded professors and researchers.  I do not like academia
    in general, but at least you can breath. 

    all the government wants and expects is mindless robots, useless 
    automans. I have "persuaded" more than one school district and its 
    teachers to stop playing with my kids' heads, trying to change 
    them to Hillary's mold for a global village... (so I practiced a 
    little: "...intimidation is just another form of communication"  
    --BFD, whatever works...).

    even today's computer kids are poorly focused; they have no concept
    of what's under the hood, or why!  they have no interest in the
    technology, methodology, or the modular concept of solution.
    they in the turn, and sooner than later, will be burned out without
    a clue of how to improve the interrelated functions.

    grade school children with calculators???  how are they supposed to
    absorb the rote learnign drill which makes it possible to "think on
    your feet?" The ability to mentally calculate and visualize are the
    keys of a generalist.

    *generation 4:  MTV and power action games of death and violence.

        actually, I am not qualified to speak on either. I have never
        allowed a TV or video game in my house.

- --
  without arms they do not resist; 
    without communication they know not what to resist.
