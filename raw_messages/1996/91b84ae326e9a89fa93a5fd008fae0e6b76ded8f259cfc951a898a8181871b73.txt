I am not sure this is correct. In-line optical amplifiers work by
stimulated emission like a laser rod. There is no intermediate
electronic stage. The amplifier is a section of fibre that is doped
with a rare earth element. The rare earth atoms are boosted into a metastable
high energy state using a power source around the fibre. Passing signals
(photons) stimulate the decays of the metastable states releasing more
photons and boosting the signal. I am not sure what the effect of this on the
polarisation characteristics of the signal is but my *hunch* is that the
polarisation characteristics would be preserved in the amplified signal.

ps Any laser physicists in the house?
