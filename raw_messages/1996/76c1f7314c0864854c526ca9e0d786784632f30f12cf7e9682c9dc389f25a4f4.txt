What's really funny here is that the harder you make it for kids to get
into something, the more they learn in order for them to get into it.
Parents who impose restrictions on their children using all sorts of
methods (hiding stuff, using the channel lock out deal, blah blah blah) are
challenging their children to use deduction and reasoning to get at what
they want.  In the case of the v-chip, channel lockout, site blocking
software, etc., the parents are turning their children into the most
horrendous creatures of all...OH!  Cypherpunks!
