	I wonder what addresses they'll be using? I can't recall a Cuba
domain, but I may easily be mistaken. If some consistent pattern can be
found, cgi scripts could block them from getting to technically useful data,
thus decreasing Cuba's economic viability further.

>   The ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma said the state-run

>   Granma said the Internet link give Cuba access to a bank of world
>   knowledge and enable it to present its point of view to the world,
>   including in areas such as scientific advances.
