Anybody who supposedly makes the "only [whatever-category] hardware solution"
for a problem has either not done their literature searching, is going for
a really obscure market niche, doesn't understand the problem, or
(very rarely) is the first product out on the bleeding edge, or has
had their competitors go out of business on them.  VSLAN (I forget the 
manufacturer) used to make an encrypting Ethernet board for PCs, Suns, etc.,
and did the software work behind it to get a B2 Red Book rating from the NSA.
Boeing had a secure FDDI ring about the same time (~5 years ago.)
Motorola has made several products for encrypting Ethernets, X.25s, and
other networks, which the military buys and likes.  Don't know which of
these are still on the market, and what new toys have appeared.

Meanwhile, the swIPe encrypted/authenticated IP protocol is available,
and the similar IPng security protocols are emerging (i.e. the RFCs are
written and folks are working on reference implementations.)
They'll cost you $0 for software plus a 386-box for Linux, or a used Sun.

If you can't get the company to show you the protocols, at least under
non-disclosure, ask them if it's NSA-certified and see what the NSA has to say
about it.  512-bit keys seem a bit short for either RSA or Diffie-Hellman
these days...

Got any short prime-number generators?
