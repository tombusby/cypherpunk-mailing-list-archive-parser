                   MARK TWAIN BANK

Mark Twain Bank is rolling back consumer Ecash fees 
in reaction to the tremendous positive response to Ecash.  
"Because of the level of interest we have elected to 
reward users for their acceptance of Ecash,"  said Frank 
Trotter, Mark Twain Ecash project director.  "Ecash 
represents the future of money and we want to make it
available to all Internet users."

Ecash enables you to control your money and your privacy
while doing business on the Internet.

The Ecash software is available free of charge when you sign 
up for an account.  Once your application has been approved
you can download the software directly from the Internet
and start using Ecash right away!

WORLD CURRENCY ACCESS ACCOUNTS ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC.  
AMOUNTS HELD IN THE ECASH MINT OF ON YOUR HARD DRIVE ARE
NOT INSURED BY THE FIDC.


NEW FEES FOR CONSUMERS
-----------------------

There is no charge for movement of money within 
the Ecash system!  Once the money is in Ecash you can do as 
many transactions as you like and it won't cost you anything 
more!

There is only a charge to move money back and forth between your
WorldCurrency Access account and the Ecash system (much like 
an ATM fee).  

Depending on the Schedule you select, and the balances you keep,
there may be no monthly fee for your WorldCurrency Access account 
or for money movements between your WorldCurrency Access account
and the Ecash Mint!

That means a no monthly fee account is within your reach!
--------------------------------------------------------

Remember that you can also earn interest by maintaining a 
balance over $2,500 in an interest bearing WorldCurrency 
Access account.

=================================================
Explanation of fees:

There are several types of fees that are designed to be easy
to understand, and low where you want them to be low.

1) Ecash Account Opening fee - this covers the processing 
   involved in setting  up an account.

2) Monthly Maintenance Fee - low if you are an infrequent 
   user - higher if you want to reduce your overall cost.  
   The monthly fee covers the scheduled number of  
   transfers to the Ecash system from your WorldCurrency 
   Access Account, and each schedule type receive a
   different charge for transfers from the Ecash system
   Back to the WorldCurrency Access account.

3) Additional transfer fee - cost per additional transfer 
   per month to the Ecash system from your WorldCurrency 
   Access account- if you just do one large one per month 
   then you may never need this.

4) Move money out of Mint - when you want to move your 
   money from the Ecash system to your WorldCurrency Access 
   account.  To make this cost effective to you there is no 
   minimum charge per transfer charge, only a charge based 
   on a percentage of the balance transferred!

5) Average Balance in WorldCurrency Access to waive Monthly 
   Fee: If you maintain this amount as an average daily 
   balance for the entire interest payment period, the 
   monthly fee will be waived.  Additional transfer fees 
   and "Move money out of Mint" fees will continue to apply 
   and can result in a charge.
