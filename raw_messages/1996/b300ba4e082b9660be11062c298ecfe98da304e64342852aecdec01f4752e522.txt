You know, I really would appriciate it if CDT didn't present S1587 as if it 
is just another "relax restrictions on encryption" bill.  We raked that bill 
over the coals, found it seriously flawed, and generally pro-encryption 
people don't seem to be defending it at all. It contained many aspects which 
have the prospect of future danger to the use of encryption.

 And, S. 1726 seems to contain most of the desireable aspects of S.1587, and 
few of the negatives.  Add to that the fact that Leahy (as described above) 
seems to be supporting S. 1726, there is no need to make it appear to an 
uninformed person that S. 1587 that it is anything other than a mistake.
