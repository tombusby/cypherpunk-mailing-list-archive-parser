Just because lots of white folks get it for a short time it must be OK then
;-) Welfare (and the so-called safety net) hurt far more people than it
helps.  The poverty rate in this country is unchanged after 30 years of
transfer payments totalling over a trillion dollars.  The worst living
conditions in the country are in areas of subsidized housing.  It ought to
start clicking with someone soon that the only people the current system
really helps are in Washington DC. I don't have a solution, but I can face
the reality that what we currently have doesn't work.  By extension, I
believe that most changes offered (more $$, minor tweaks to the system),
will offer similarly poor results.

Micheal Moore is far down on my list of reputable authors.  His point is
blatantly untrue, as it equates direct transfer payments (welfare) to tax
breaks (in the same light, your mortgage and dependant deductions should
count as transfer payments to individuals).  Not that I am for corporate
welfare.  Personally, I am for elimination of corporate income tax entirely
- who do you think really pays it?  Hint - it is you and me in higher prices
for goods and lower return on investments.  As such, it is the worst kind of
tax, an invisible one.

BINGO!  You win the prize.  We also have lower unemployment, higher GDP
growth and more economic stability than any of the other large
industrialized counties. You think there might be a correlation there?

This is just silly.  If you run a business you are employing lots of folks,
and you are delivering a product or service.  This is producing.  If you are
a shareholder, you are risking your capital to support a business, hoping
that business will grow, producing more jobs, etc.  Besides, because of the
growth of 401K plans, the majority of Americans now fall into the
shareholder category.

As I said, I don't agree with corporate welfare.  Of course, GM produces far
more jobs than the average welfare recipient.

Agreed.  But how do you redistribute wealth without a statist society?  The
only reason I pay taxes is because I will go to jail if I don't.
