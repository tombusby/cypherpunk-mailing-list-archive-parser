Unfortunately, making a system more reliable and available sometimes
entails additional cost in terms of complexity and redundancy.

If you don't see why I think it's wrong to pretend to be able to do
something you can't do, then I probably can't explain it to you.

Try asking your parents or your priest or something. :-)

I think it'll be pretty efficient, though.

That's a very good point: I retract the InterNIC siggestion.

Also it's possible for someone to be reached at a certain address, but not
be able to e-mail from that address. So here's the new improved version:

Scenario 1. Alice used to be a student at nursery.edu, reachable as
alice@nursery.edu. She can no longer log in there, but her e-mail is
forwarded to alice@work.com. Alice doesn't wish to receive anonymous
e-mail via her edu account unless it includes a reply block.

Alice tells one of the 'bots maintaining the blocking lists that she
wants alice@nursery.edu blocked. She should be able to make this
request via a WWW form or by e-mailing a 'bot from alice@work.com.

The 'bot sends a cookie to alice@nursery.edu, which is forwarded to
alice@work.com. Alice sends back the cookie to confirm.

(To prevent an obvious attack, the 'bot shouldn't send more than one
cookie to a given address in a 24-hour period. Perhaps one of the
flags should be 'don't send cookies unless the request is e-mailed
from the account.)

Scenario 2: root@bwalk.dm.com wants to add *@bwalk.dm.com to the
blocking list. (Not likely. :-). Again, the request is submitted
to one of the 'bots via a WWW form or by e-mail. Seeing that the
address contains a wildcard, the 'bot sends a cookie to
postmaster@bwalk.dm.com. Presumably whoever reads postmaster
mailbox is authorized to send back the cookie and to confirm
the wildcard block.

I think it's fair to assume that whoever demonstrates his ability to
receive postmaster's mail by returning a cookie sent to postmaster has
the authority to block receivers in that domain.

I.e. there needs to be a way for postmaster@toad.com to say:
block cypherpunks@toad.com, but send the cookie to postmaster@toad.com,
not cypherpunks@toad.com.

I think it's fair to assume that whoever gets a cookie sent to an
address has the authority to block that address: that takes care of
the .forward scenario I described.

I just came up with another one above. :-) I think reserving 32 bits should
be enough for future expansion, or 64 to be really generous with disk space.

I agree that each operator should be able to block what goes out of
his remailer based on strings being contained in the body. However
having some Cabal force this filtering automatically on all remailer
operators is a very bad idea, even if the operators consent to it.
In the scenario you described above, was the victim's address encrypted
in the reply block, or was it in cleartext? If it was in cleartext, then
it's little different from Peter Vorobiev forging garbage in my name
and Timmy May (fart) quoting it as someting I really said.

(Some time ago Vorobiev forged Usenet articles from my wife's seldom used
account on another machine claiming that we split up. Dave Hayes actually
asked me over the phone if it's true. There are strange people out there.)


I'm not claiming to have all the solutions - this is merely a way to
block recepients without taking up too much of operator's time.
