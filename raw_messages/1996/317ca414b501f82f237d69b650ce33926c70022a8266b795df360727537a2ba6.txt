Something I picked up from a mailing list called dc-stuff. <dc-stuff@fc.net> It's mostly having to do with security and hacking, thought not typically the "bad" sort. Thought it might not only be of interest the cypherpunks, but perhaps you could offer some hints, tips, advice??  

Cheers,

I've been working on a project in secret for a few months, and now am
talking about it with everyone so that we can all help it along.

Want all the Internet traffic between you and every other
privacy-conscious site on the net, worldwide, to automatically be
encrypted using Triple-DES, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman?  Without changing
your hardware or software, except to stick a Linux PC on your network, or
install a new version of Linux on your laptop?  Want it all by Christmas?
