I really hope that this is the case, and that some restraint would be
exercised. But when the FCC has historically concerned itself with channels
of communication, the 1st Am has typically been tossed out of the window.
Recall the "seven dirty words" brouhaha.  

Perhaps they've lightened up.  I can imagine Herr Hundt and his FCC fellows
looking on fondly and indulgently as cute-as-a-button sitcom kids inform
their network TV show parents more frequently than we've heard "fuckhead" on
this list that they "suck."

I seem to recall somewhere in the dim dark past that the expression "you
suck" would have been subsumed under the "fighting words" statutes,
implying, as it does, that the object of the utterer's scorn was either
homosexual or a woman who casually performed fellation.

If the FCC approves of "you suck" on network television, perhaps there is
yet hope that the perverse topics daily discussed on c-punks would, at least
temporarily, be allowed.
