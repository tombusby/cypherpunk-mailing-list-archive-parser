I wonder if a 'who cypherpunks' would disclose a subscription from
abusebot@savetrees.com?

I'm already doing that.  I began with the very first one I received, and
instructed him to block all mail to my two domains.  After 3, I began
invoicing Mr. Wallace $25 per message.  His bill is up to $100 right
now.  I expect it will go higher (although the snail mail copy _might_
get more attention than the email).

Anyone on the list know of a good, heavy-handed collection agency that
would like to take this when it tops, say, $500?
