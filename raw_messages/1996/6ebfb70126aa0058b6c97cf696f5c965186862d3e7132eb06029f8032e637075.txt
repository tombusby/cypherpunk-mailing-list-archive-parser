If you think about the issue in more detail, you will realize that having a
third party do signature verification is no more useful than having a third
party do your encryption for you. In other words, not only is it not
useful, it is downright dangerous, since it provides you with a false sense
of security. If someone wishes to bounce messages that don't verify back to
the originator, great. But please do not further add to list traffic by
bouncing these messages to the list.
