The most significant would be the presence of a compression header (what
has the data 
telling how to decompress a datastream). If you leave this in (for
instance, assuming you 
were to use PKZIP (STUPID!) you would have PK as the first two bytes
EVERY TIME!) you give 
your codebreaker a HUGE advantage. You can bypass this by removing ANY
information which 
isn't message specific and standardizing on one compression method.
Alternately, you could 
use your session key to encrypt a length word and then pad the start (and
end) with a 
string of random characters.
