        Sounds good but I had to laugh when I heard it... is he at odds with
other members of the administration, or is this rhetoric?

                              
>         CAMBRIDGE, Mass (Reuter) - Vice President Al Gore said  
>Friday society should not resort to ``unwarranted censorship'' 
>on the Internet as an overreaction to protect children from 
>objectionable material in cyperspace. 
>         In a commencement address at the Massachusetts Institute of  
>Technology, Gore said government had to assist parents in 
>protecting their children from exposure to such material. 
>         ``But let me also state my clear and unequivocal view that a  
>fear of chaos cannot justify unwarranted censorship of free 
>speech, whether that speech occurs in newspapers, on the 
>broadcast airwaves -- or over the Internet.'' 
>         ``Our best reaction to the speech we loathe is to speak out,  
>to reject, to respond, even with emotion and fervor, but to 
>censor -- no. That has not been our way for 200 years, and it 
>must not become our way now,'' he said. 
>         In February, President Clinton signed the Communications  
>Decency Act, which bans making indecent material available to 
>minors over computer networks. 
>         The American Civil Liberties Union and the American Library  
>Association have filed suit in a Philadelphia court challenging 
>the law as unconstitutional, saying it would stifle a broad 
>range of speech. 
>         In his address at the MIT, Gore stressed the gulf separating  
>society and science, a theme students had suggested in e-mail 
>messages to the vice president. He said new technologies 
>initially break down stable patterns and ``then new ones emerge 
>at a higher degree of complexity. 
>         ``Societies are vulnerable to misinterpreting the first  
>stage as a descent into chaos and then overreacting with the 
>imposition of a rigid, stagnating order,'' Gore told the 2,000 
>graduates in an outdoor ceremony. 
>
