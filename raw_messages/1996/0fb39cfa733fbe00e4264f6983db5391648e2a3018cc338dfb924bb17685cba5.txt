  As far as I know we are not bundling a certificate.  It doesn't say so
in the press release either, so I wonder what made you think that we were?

  What do you mean by "close ties to Netscape"?  You are making this sound
like some sort of conspiracy.  We are customers of RSA and Verisign, just
like c2.org or microsoft.com.

  I encourage you and anyone else who is interested to do this if you want
to.  However I do suggest that you consult a lawyer, since there may be
liability issues involved.  There are a lot of big and medium sized companies
that are entering or about to enter this market.  I'm sure there is room for
some lean low cost ones too.

  Again I encourage you to help in educating the public about the issues
involved.

  You seem to be under the incorrect impression that Netscape is in some
conspiracy with verisign to control the market for certificates.  Nothing
is further from the truth.  We are taking steps to increase competition in
the market and give users the ultimate choice about who they want to trust.
The ability to add and delete trusted CAs in the 2.0 Navigator is just the
first step.

  We are also working on a written criteria for including CA certs in the
"Netscape provided" set.  I've been involved in writing the criteria, and
have tried to push it in a direction that will allow little guys to
compete on even ground with the big guys.  I don't know when it will be
available since the whole process involves lawyers and issues of liability,
so we just have to wait until they bless it.  As soon as we can make it
available we will.

  I recently created a document that describes how our current products
deal with certificates.  This should be enough on the technical side to
allow anyone to create a CA.  That document can be found at:

  I hope I have addressed your concerns.
