KCFE has a brief and shallow "Business Report" in the afternoon.
Yesterday, one of the items was Netscape's getting permission to make
the US version available over the Internet.  The bit mentioned a
"strengthened method of scrambling data" and also mentioned the Gov't
concern that it might be downloaded by terrorist groups.  Some good,
some bad.
