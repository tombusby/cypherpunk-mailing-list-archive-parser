Last semester I taught a seminar on computers, crime, and privacy and we
had, as a guest lecturer one evening, Silicon Valley's one full time
computer cop (he works for the SC County D.A.'s office). One of his
comments was that ISP's were generally very cooperative, because they knew
that he could legally impose large costs on them by seizing their systems
as evidence.
