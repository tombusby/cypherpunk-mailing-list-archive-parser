They are not very hard to set up and run. I think any blinding is likely to
be simple header faking. Totally insignificant security compared to
something like Mixmaster. I proposed a system some time back based on
message pools, but it attracted little interest. The down side of the
proposal is the large amount of bandwidth required. Each remailer has to
receive all messages for all remailers in the pool. The upside of the
proposal was that it allowed secure reply blocks (ones that can't simply be
tracked forward).
