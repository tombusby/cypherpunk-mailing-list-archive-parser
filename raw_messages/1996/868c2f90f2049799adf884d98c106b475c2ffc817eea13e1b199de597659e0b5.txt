I was right in the first message... it is a reputation thing.  We don't
disagree on any of the fact here, just on their implications.

I see this from the point of view of the author of these native methods,
cypherpunk still do write code sometimes.  From that point of view
where is the difference between calling my native code methods and
calling the java.awt.*, or netscape.* methods that are native code?  Yes, 
either can do anything they want, irregardless of the SecurityManager.

For J. Random User on the net, Sun/Netscape's reputations are
fairly strong and mine is non-existent.  For the corporate IS folks to
whom I contract this situation is reversed.  (Despite impressive IPOs
I still get a lot of friction about 'programs downloaded from the net'.)
