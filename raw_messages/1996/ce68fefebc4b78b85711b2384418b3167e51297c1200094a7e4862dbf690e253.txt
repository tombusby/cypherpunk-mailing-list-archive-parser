The two usual ways to do this on the internet are
1) Use the same address you used to join the list (you _did_ save it?)
2) somethinglist@somewhere.com is administered by
   somethinglist-request@somewhere.com (though this is often a frontend
   for some mailbot like majordomo or listserv @somewhere.com , and
   may just send you instructions for finding the real mailbot.)
