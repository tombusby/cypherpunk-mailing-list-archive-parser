PLEASE RECIRCULATE!

Mike Godwin, staff counsel for EFF and eloquent supporter of civil 
liberties online and off, will be our guest at HotWired's Electronic 
Frontiers Forum this Thursday, February 8, at 7PM PST, 9PM CST, 10PM EST.

Coincidentally, President Clinton is scheduled to sign the Telecom Bill 
the same day, and the '48 Hours of Protest' demonstration will begin when 
the bill is signed.

We encourage online activists to participate in the ongoing EF Forums as a 
chat space wherein we can discuss new developments and issues of 
organization in support of a free and open Internet. A login is required 
but the account is free. We're at http://www.hotwired.com/club or 
telnet://chat.wired.com:2428.

thanks,
Jon L.
