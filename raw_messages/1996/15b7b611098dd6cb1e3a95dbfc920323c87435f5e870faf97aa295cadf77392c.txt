	IIRC, there was some discussion of some form of blind trusts a bit
back... it was used under English common law to enable stuff before the
actual invention of corporations. The ownership of the stock of such an
offshore company by one or more such trusts might get around such problems,
especially if the trusts had those (very interesting) flight provisions I
believe you mentioned a bit back.

	RE: making a profit. Well, yes, it is a pretty good argument that
you aren't just going for lack of liability, since that's part of what
corporations are _for_...
