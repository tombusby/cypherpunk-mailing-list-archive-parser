Why should I? Was his membership under attack by the body?

I merely predicted how he would act. In the words of Click&Clack,
that's not rocket science. Almost anyone who has spent anytime
on Usenet knows, for example, that SternFUD will keep dragging
sci.crypt back in, and he will engage in personal slams, while
claiming he is above same. 

In the words of a net attorney I respect, SternFud is an
intellectual fraud.

[BTW, if you caught my post on same, he seems to regarded as a
buffoon & joke even within the inner circles of the Intelligence
Community...]

But I AM glad he left. Now, I do not have to feel quezyness over
agreeing (even on but one issue...) with Perry.
