If you think the applications for the use of cryptographic blinding 
techniques is "crypto-irrelevant" then you're even more clueless than I'd 
previously surmised.  See Chaum's article of August 1992 if you doubt this.

The money will eventually be spendable.  But information as to the number 
and timing and size of the donations will be disguised using blinding 
techniques.  Re-read my comments.

Nobody said politics had to be easy.  They'll adjust to the new reality; 
they always do.

Since you obviously don't understand it, and you also don't understand 
cryptographic blinding, why should anybody pay attention to your opinion?

Always overstating your case, I see.  For the application I described, it 
isn't necessary to have "complete anonymity."  What's needed is a healthy 
dose of fog and uncertainty, making sure that the candidates can't trust any 
claim that a donor has made a donation of any particular size.

Since today's campaign contribution limits seem to be inherently a violation 
of freedom of speech, why not embrace my solution, which doesn't do this?

"Constitutionalist"?  Hell no!  I subscribe to the idea inherent in the 
joke, "The Constitution may be bad government, but it's better than what we 
have now."  I think there's no doubt that a government based scrupulously on 
the US Constitution would be a vast improvement.  However, we've never had 
such a thing.

Such "proof" will be easily faked, BTW, which is part of the reason this 
system will work so well.  I could go to some candidate and claim that I'd 
made a $10,000 contribution to his campaign.  Let's say I'd show him a 
(forged) cancelled check.  What could he do about it?  Would he risk pissing 
off a valuable contributor?

Which is exactly why the faking process will be so easily accomplished.

>All lobbies will continue to give.

And, obviously, they'll claim they gave far more than the really did.  This 
is okay, it'll destroy the credibility of anyone who claims to have made a 
contribution.

Sure about that?  Let me provide some contrary evidence.  Every once in a 
while, you'll see on the TV networks a report about corporate (and labor, 
BTW) campaign giving, and they will occasionally point out that a given 
corporation (or PAC, etc.) gives money BOTH to the Republicans and the 
Democrats.  They have no reason to do this, except that they think they will 
get some benefit in the future from the "access" that contribution produces. 
 This is particularly true, since the identities of all contributors are 
currently public knowledge.  
If an organization expected no direct return benefit from making 
contributions (for example, if the donations were adequately blinded), it 
would make them ONLY to the side they considered would best help them, and 
not the opponents.  If they thought it necessary, they would lie about 
making a contribution to the other candidate.

I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with this AS LONG AS the 
system makes it difficult or impossible to identifiably reward contributors.

I stand by my original statement.  True, the origins of the Internet were 
primarily government-sponsored and financed, but by now the vast majority of 
the traffic goes through privatized connections (Sprint, MCI, AT+T), and 
most of the users access the web through private (not government owned or 
controlled) ISP's:  Compuserve, AOL, Prodigy, and hundreds if not thousands 
of "Mom+Pop" ISP's around the country.

I should also point out that given the fact that the Internet is at least 
doubling and probably tripling in size (packets and/or users) every year, if 
you go back to the last year that the backbone was government-financed) 
you'll probably discover that the Internet was far less than 1/10th of its 
current size.  

 
>Let me ask you this.  Do you enjoy the net of today (AOL, Spam,

Why should I mind the particular characteristics ("XXX-rated transfers") of 
the traffic jams?  What are you, some kind of Born-again christian or 
something?   And while I don't like the spam, either, I am under no illusion 
that this would be particularly avoidable, and certainly not EASILY or 
perfectly avoidable.  Spam is, at most, a minor inconvenience most of the time.

It sounds like you're making a contradition.  Previously, you suggested that 
a privatized system wouldn't work, but at the end of the last paragraph you 
seem to be saying that the blame falls on "the legislature"'s doing 
something wrong.

See the problem with that position?  Please get your story straight.

The main victims of the "S&L fiasco" were the taxpayers who had to pay 
hundreds of billions of dollars in claims due to the government 
simultaneously maintaining the S&L insurance but chancing the laws to allow 
the fraud that trashed that industry.  In other words, the problems were 
CAUSED BY GOVERNMENT.  And like I suggested, no the average taxpayer didn't 
have any ability to fight this rape of his wallet:  He didn't find out about 
it until it was mostly all over.

And if you object to being rooked in a company's bankruptcy, complain to the 
government who makes itself a preferred creditor  in almost all circumstances.

If it's "perfectly legal" yet "inherently unfair," it sounds like much of 
the blame lies with the legislature, since it is the legislature that is 
responsible for the laws.  Huh?

In the example _you_ mentioned, the S&L bailout, no "heads rolled."  Was any 
government employee punished at all?  I don't recall it!

The goal is not, specifically, to "stop the flow of money."  The goal is to 
ensure that candidates know as little as possible about where the money 
comes from.

You are coming to conclusions without support.  As I said before, you've 
convinced yourself that you KNOW that a particular election went a 
particular way precisely because of "public employees."  Sigh!
