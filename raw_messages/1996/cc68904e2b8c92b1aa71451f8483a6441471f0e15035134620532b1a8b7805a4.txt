Ha! You think a pre-1992 compiler and OS wil fix this? What about the processor?

I can assure you, as a longterm Intel employee during these formative
years, that Intel was pressured into including the famous "NSA
instructions" into the 8080, in 1974. These instructions are well-known,
and the Cray had them as well.

Inasmuch as the 8080 instructions live on in every x86 processor--like the
reptilian brain inside all of us--this gives the NSA instant access to all
contents of the processor.

This is why I use a Mac, of course.
