I have released a 32-bit version of Puffer 2.0 for Windows 95 and NT
systems.
It has the same features as the 16-bit version except it now supports
long
file names.  The exportable shareware version is available from my web
site at:

http://execpc.com/~kbriggs

An upgrade patch for registered users is also available there.  A brief
description of Puffer is provided below.
