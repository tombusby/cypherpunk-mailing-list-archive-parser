	Somehow, I suspect that their efforts will A: not include any non-GAKed
cryptography involvement, and probably minimal GAKed cryptography - less chance
of someone using superencryption in a hard-to-detect fashion. I also suspect
that they'll be cutting down on anonymnity, or at least trying to. Notice the
link to an almost completely unrelated incident, namely the Oklahoma City
bombing.
