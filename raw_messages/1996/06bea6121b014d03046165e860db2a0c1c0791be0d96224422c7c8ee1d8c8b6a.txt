	NSA RELEASES DECLASSIFIED FOSTER DOCUMENTS


     The National Security Agency  has  now  released  the  first
batch  of  documents  in  response  to  a  Washington Weekly FOIA
request filed in August of 1995. The documents, pertaining to the
late  Vincent  W.  Foster  and  his  work  with  the NSA and with
Systematics Inc. have many passages and  names  blacked  out  and
some  documents  bear "Confidential" or "Secret" classifications.
The  first  batch  of   documents   contain   77   pages.   After
conversations  with  NSA  staff, we understand that an additional
estimated  600 to 700 pages of documents will be released pending
review  by  other  intelligence  agencies.  The Washington Weekly
eventually will make all documents available on its web site.

VINCE FOSTER INVOLVED IN NSA COMPUTER ESPIONAGE ISSUES

    One morning in May of 1993, a  mini  bus  left  the  National
Security  Agency  at  Ft.  George  G.  Meade,  Maryland. It drove
directly to the White House  to  pick  up  Bernard  Nussbaum  and
Vincent W. Foster. From there, the party proceeded to the Justice
Department to pick up Webster Hubbell and John  Rogovin.  At  the
Supreme  Court,  Justice John Paul Stevens joined the party. They
all returned to the NSA for a secret roundtable  discussion  with
top NSA officials on Codebreaking and Telecommunications.  On the
agenda were items such as:

 * What Has Happened to SIGINT
 * How We Handle Crypt[ology] Problems
 * Problems We Face In The Future
 * Rule of Law

    Only this broad outline of  the  meeting  is  revealed  in  a
recently  declassified  NSA document. But it makes clear that one
of  Vince  Foster's  responsibilities  at  the  White  House  was
cryptology  and  intelligence gathering. As such, he was privy to
top secrets.  That would explain the presence of two NSA  binders
deposited  by  Vince Foster in a White House safe. So why did the
White House deny that Foster was working on NSA  documents?  Last
May, White House spokesman Mark Fabiani told the Washington Times
that "There were no National Security Agency  documents  that  he
was working on that were in his possession."

    Why did the White House try to conceal Foster's NSA ties? Why
did  Fabiani  find it necessary to contradict the sworn statement
of Foster's secretary Deborah Gorham, who said that  "There  were
two  one-inch  ring  binders that were from the National Security
Agency"?
