You want a continuous Fourier transform, not a discrete one, to
determine the frequency spectrum of the waveform being sampled.
The FFT is simply an algorithm for computing the DFT without
redundant computation.  In general, any Lebesgue integrable
complex function will have a Fourier transform, even one with a
finite number of discontinuities. The reverse transform will
faithfully reproduce the function, modulo the usual caveats about
function spaces and sets of measure zero.

There is no meaningful difference between speaking of the highest
frequency in a signal, and the highest frequency present in its
Fourier transform.

The Fourier transforms of step functions, square wave functions,
delta functions, and other oddities are perfectly well defined.
Again, the FFT is not relevant here.  A step function does not
have a upper cutoff in the frequency domain, so you can never
reproduce it perfectly from its samples, although the faster you
sample, the sharper the edges of the reconstruction will become.

I don't think so.

I must have been absent on "tooth day" in Functional Analysis

AIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  (I feel much better now :)
