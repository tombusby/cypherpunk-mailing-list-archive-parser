Getting a program to recognize a subliminal message channel is even
harder than teaching a human to do so, check out the book Disappearing
Cryptography or do a web search for "mimic functions" to see how easy it
is to hide messages in text which a program parses as regular English.
The other problem is that more and more of the data being tossed around
the net are images and sound files in which it is incredibly easy to
hide encrypted messages.

And if there was a penalty for using PGP then PGP would hide the fact
that such messages were being sent; that -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
line in the program output does not need to be there you know... Check
out Stealth PGP for an example.

Except for the fact that US law stops at the US border (modulo kidnapping
Mexican doctors or strongarming the rest of the world to obey US
dictates...)  Information, on the other hand, is very easy to transport
across national boundaries and such transmission is impossible to stop.
With remailers outside the US I can send a message to a free nation and
have it delivered to whomever I want.
