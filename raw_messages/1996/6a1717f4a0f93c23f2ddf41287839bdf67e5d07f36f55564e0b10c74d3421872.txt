These views are shared by only a small minority of the patriot movement.
 This paragraph is pure propaganda.  There are some of these people in the
patriot community, but their percentages are not much higher than in the
general population.

If Federal LEO's are getting so much help from volunteer snitches, why do we

Don't wait.  Act precipitously.  Burn all the [insert disliked
individuals/groups here].  Oh, wait.  Isn't that what Hitler did?

There is NO clearly established connection between McVeigh and ANY militia
group.  This notion is more government propaganda.

I find it ironic that the SPLC is run by far-left radicals of the type who
did a lot of bitching in the 60's when their ox was being gored.  (Does
anyone remember COINTELPRO?)

The Wiesenthal center is actively supporting legislation (the anti-terror
bill, various gun control bills, etc.) that would give our gov't many of the
same powers Hitler had, which he eventually used against the Jews.  Those who
refuse to learn from history will be condemned to repeat it.

About 3 in all, if I recall the news reports correctly.  This "KKK people
support Buchanan so Buchanan is bad" idea is fatuous liberal propaganda.  If
one were to poll the members of North American Man-Boy Love Association, a
majority of them would probably support Clinton, because of his policy of
loosening restrictions on "alternate lifestyles."  However, I have yet to see
any demonization of Clinton on this basis anywhere. (Not that I think it
would be justified, mind you.)

BTW, if the "advancement" of people on the basis of skin color is racist,
then the NAACP, La Raza, et al, should be put out of business as well as the
KKK and the National Association for the Advancement of White People.

The 5 million figure is low.  The NRA had almost that many members last I
heard, and most of them are not survivalists, tax protestors, or neo-Nazis.
Gun enthusiast == virulent hatred of government?  More propaganda...

Shooting and burning people without a compelling reason for doing so pisses
people off, and lowers public confidence in the agencies doing the shooting
and burning.  What is so radical about that?

>The False Patriots report reveals the people behind the
>"Patriot" movement, people like Louis Beam, a key Aryan

Beam may be a poo-bah in the Aryan Nations, but most "partiots" find his
views revolting.  This is another example of using an atypical aberration as
an excuse for demonizing an entire group.  I have yet to see a major news
organization use the Unabomber to demonize radical leftist environmental
extremists in this way, but the comparison would be far more truthful the
ones made here.

Which turned out to have been done by a disgruntled former railroad employee
who left the "sons of gestapo" note as a red herring.  Could you at least
stick to propaganda that has at least some basis in fact?

Explosives thefts are nothing new.  Regulation of explosive materials is.
 Explosives and poisons can be made out of commonly available materials.  If
this is such a problem, how come this country wasn't bombed and poisoned into
oblivion 50 years ago?

Another unsubstantiated insinuation that McVeigh is a

Yes, throw out the second amendment.  The government can control people much

Absolutely, yes, hallelujah, preach it brother!  You might want to chesk out
other sources than the SPLC, however.  The best way to find out what views an
organization holds is to directly contact the organization, rather than a
member of the opposition with an axe to grind.

>The "Patriot" movement thrives on secrecy and citizen apathy.

So does government tyranny and oppression.

Yes, concentrate on the skinheads and other kooks.  That way, you can tar
everyone else with the same stick...

I find it disgusting that a radical left-wing propaganda outlet like the SPLC
can legally call itself a "charity."
