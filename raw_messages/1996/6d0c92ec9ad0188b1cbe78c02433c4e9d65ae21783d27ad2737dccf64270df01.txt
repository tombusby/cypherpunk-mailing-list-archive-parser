Politicians need money to pay bills.  If you are cutting off all 
prediction of money appearing (which is impossible unless you get rid 
of all special interests) no campaign can ever have the ability to 
plan.  This is a major part of all campaigns.  Resistance to this 
will be high (not that this wasnt expected.)

Why don't you run for office.  I did.  Reality, after all, is far 
better than theory.

Every candidate ever endorsed by the Firefighters Union in my town 
have been absolutely elected.  Looking at the firefighters voting 
records and matching with their addresses shows a distinct pattern of 
voting in almost every election.  They have sufficient numbers to win 
every time.

Power currupts.  Not size of governement.  I agree we need to shrink 
our gov't a whole lot.  I believe whole heartedly in the 
Constitution.  I advocate the entire Bill of Rights.  I also support 
meaningful campaign finance reform.  But ya know what?  I lost.

Change doesn't depend on changing finance laws.  Much as in nature, 
these people will always find a way around it.  It depends on helping 
people empower themselves.  Making them know their vote DOES count.  
People who want real reform should fight actively for it.
