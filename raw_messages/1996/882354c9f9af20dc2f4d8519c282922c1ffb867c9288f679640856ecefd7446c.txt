:-)  That's exactly what I was afraid of (ConspiricyPunks).  My point is
not to drag out conspiricy arguments.  I am trying to state that the
balance of power would remain lopsided in the direction it has been, even
with the new system; the power would remain with the rich.  Are you saying
that just because the average person is not rich, they do not deserve the
same voting power as the rich?  I must remind *you* that this is not
alt.elitism either ;-)

That "deathstamping" organization would then become the new govt. and would
be just as vunerable to corruption as any other govt, except that now we
don't even know who the unjust leaders are!  I await your further
explainations.
