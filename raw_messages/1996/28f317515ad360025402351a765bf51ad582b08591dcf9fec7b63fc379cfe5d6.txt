Brian describes a UI metaphor for micropayments, with a gauge
indicating the value of your micropayment purse and a cutoff for
the maximum automatic per-unit payment:

That's fine so long as the majority of sites one visits all cost within,
say, an order of magnitude or so.

What happens if people skip around a lot? When I go from checking out
Hagbard's Poetry Corner, which charges $.02 cents per page (and falls
below the speedometer cutoff), and switch over to Belbo's Future's
Tips Market, which charges a dollar a page, I'm going to get annoying
alerts every click. If one allows customizing the cutoff for each page,
the guage becomes meaningless (as much as if your car occasionally sucked
half the gas tank at one stoplight). If you don't, it is annoying.

Sure, $1.00 a page, perhaps, pushes the micropayment scale, but
I'm sure there are plenty of folks who would set the cutoff in
that range or higher.

Perhaps a graphical relation-o-meter, comparing some user defined
scale to the cost of the current page, so that users could get a
relative feel for high rent districts (Web-rent control, anyone?),
but I can see pitfalls to this appoach, too.

I don't think this works unless the micropayments world standardizes
on a very narrow price band, which isn't very likely, or people are
found to stick pretty consistently to a given price when browsing,
which I don't think is very likely either.

It strikes me as perhaps more useful for account-driven billing systems,
where one has a contanst quanta of payment magnitude.
