Hey, if a high school can teach kids to read the Associated Press
critically and think about what it's saying and means, they're doing
a really fine job!  For that matter, if they can teach kids to just
read the news at all, they're accomplishing something.

I was surprised by the idea of teaching Advanced Placement classes
in a middle school - in the reasonably high-quality public school I went to,
most of the AP classes were taken by 12th graders and a few by 11th-graders,
though this was partly because that's when we started getting slack in our
schedules after taking the regular courses.
