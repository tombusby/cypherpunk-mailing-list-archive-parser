Matts, you don't want to do floating point for money, because
floating point doesn't give you good control of precision.  If
you want to know how it _is_ done, RTFAPI ("read the fantastic
API.")  Scan for "EC_Coinage".


Keep in mind that only Ecash(tm) Mints can create Ecash(tm) 
coins and choose what values the coins have.


I'm glad you are asking these questions.  Perhaps this will be
the start of the Ecash(tm) API FAQ.


Regards,

Bryce

(I'm getting tired of typing "(tm)".  I'm going to make a macro
that appends "(tm)" to every instance of "Ecash" as I type 
it...)
