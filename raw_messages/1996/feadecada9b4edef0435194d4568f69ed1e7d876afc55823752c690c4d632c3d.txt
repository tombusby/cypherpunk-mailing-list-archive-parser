Kinda cool.  Seems like a pretty basic .ASM file, though (I'll have to see how
to implement it tonight).  Couldn't resist; I had to run it.  It converts 
files into directories.  Really outdated.  My guess is its algorithm is to 
start at C:\ and go into each directory from "C:\A*" to "C:D*" and convert
each file into a directory.  Subdirectories are unaffected.  Apparently, this
is an attempt to overwrite you DOS directory.  Too bad I'm running WinNT! :-)
If I'm not mistaken, Win95 would be unaffected, as well.  The only things of
(little) value I lost were in my Borland C base directory.  The file didn't
even modify "C:\"!  

Gee, it's great when you get to run Trojan Horses because you know the
company's IT dept. will clone you a new machine if you mess it up!  ;-)

Anyway.  Now you all know what this does.  BTW, for future reference, does
anyone know of a way to convert the directories back to files?  My guess is
"no"...

One more question.  Not to spread (in)fame...  Anyone know where I can find
Skism?  One mod greets did was create the directory "SKISM.   ".  Name sounds
familiar, but not sure.

PM
