Rebuttal? Why?  Remailers generally are.  There aren't enough penet.fi 
type remailers, which people prefer not only because there is a mapping 
but because it's easier to use.  (It's also a bit more secure if there
are c2-nym remailers mapped to penet.fi type remailers in various
countries).

Not everyone is on a system that is PGP-friendly.  Handling PGP-messages
from commercial services or even most mailer apps is awkward at best,
and the commands for mixmaster/c'punk remailers are not as standard as
they could be.  (A PGP3 DLL would improve the use of crypto and anon-
remailers quite a bit.)
