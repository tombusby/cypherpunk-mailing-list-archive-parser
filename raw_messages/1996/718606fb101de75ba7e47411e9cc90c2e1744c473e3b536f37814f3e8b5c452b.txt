It's interesting that some of the first things to pop up with a AV search
of "Webcom AND Zundel" were instructions posted in one of German groups
about how to bypass the access restrictions...

[Actually, I just tried this search again, and didn't find the messages.
Maybe I am misremembering I did last night, or maybe....]

A Usenet message claims that Deutsche Bank is on the same Web server (?)
and cannot access some of its customers. Whatever the precise truth of
this, a side effect of countries trying to disconnect themselves from Bad
Thoughts is disruption of commerce. This may provoke a bigger reaction than
all of our protests and civil liberties points.
