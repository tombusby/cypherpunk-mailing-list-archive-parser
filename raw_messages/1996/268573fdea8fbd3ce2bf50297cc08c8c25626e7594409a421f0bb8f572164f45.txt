Sounds like they are doing something like this:

        Generate a prime P of 500 bits (say)
        Encrypt with Mallets public key
        Generate start_q using (E(P) << 524)/P
        Keep incrementing start_q until prime, and call this Q
        Generate N by multiplying P and Q to get a 1024 bit key
        Top 500 bits of N will be E(P)

It could also be done like this:

        Generate a random H of, say, 290 bits
        Keep incrementing H until (H << 300) + 1 is prime
        and call this Q
        Encrypt H for Mallet
        H <<= 10
        Keep incrementing H until prime
        Generate N by multiplying P by Q, to get a 900 bit key
        Bottom 300 (but 10) bits of N will E(P)

I'm sure there are few mistakes, and there need to be
a few other trivial tests in there somewhere, but I think this
should work.

The first method should produce "better" keys than the first
(as if Mallet cares)

I'll try and knock some code up to demonstrate this over the next
few days.
