But the FBI presumably has no data base of voices to compare the voice on
the 911 tape to! They can have the most sophisticated voice analysis system
in the world and it useless, except in comparing the voice to
previously-recorded samples.

(This is presumably how the NSA's capabilities are used, as they have the
voice patterns of Boris Yeltsin, Yassir Arafat, Saddam Hussein, Bob Dole
and other previously-recorded voices. Plus, they can use COMINT at will
outside the U.S. (and maybe in the U.S....) and can acquire new voice
patterns for their libraries.)
