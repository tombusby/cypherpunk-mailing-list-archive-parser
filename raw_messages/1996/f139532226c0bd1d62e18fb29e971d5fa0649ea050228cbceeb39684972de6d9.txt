I stopped buying Wired because I never could find anything but page after
page of print that looked like it had been cut out of several different
newspapers and magazines and glued to the page, along with gaudy,
hard-on-the-eyes graphics.  I never got past the graphics to the 
less-than-stellar articles.

Gee ... someone who knows *real* reporting!  I'm suitably impressed, Tim ;)

The problem is, books aren't getting any cheaper, and to build a decent 
technical library takes several hundred dollars - not to mention the $200 
or $300 a year it takes just to stay current.

Read lots of book reviews by people you trust. :) If I looked at every
book on the shelf that had the word "Internet" in the title, I'd be in the
bookstore from dawn till dusk.  There used to be two or three really good
books on VB on the shelves - and a couple of ones that I'd classify as
"fair".  Yesterday, I counted almost 50 different books on VB at Barnes &
Noble.  It's getting rediculous.  Like someone's claim to fame is they've
written a computer book.  The market's *way* oversaturated, yet the
clueless publishing houses keep cranking 'em out, all in an attempt to get
a piece of the pie, I suppose. 

Buyer beware is my new motto.
