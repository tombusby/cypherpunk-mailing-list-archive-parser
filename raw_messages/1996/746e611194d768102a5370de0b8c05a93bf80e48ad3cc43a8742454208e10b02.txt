There is a new Spanish Crypto Resources Web page [it"s enterely
in Spanish] on the World Wide Web...

           <http://bbs.seker.es/~alvy/cripto.html>

This page contains information about crypto in Spain, specially
links and info on spanish companies, magazines, associations,
events... and also some info on security, privacy, hackers &
crackers. Quite new right now, I hope it will be updated soon
with info and support from other spanish-speaking crypto-fans.

You will find some global links and references too.

Please, distribute this URL and info freely.
