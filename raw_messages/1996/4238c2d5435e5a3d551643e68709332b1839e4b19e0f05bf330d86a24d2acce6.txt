Several years ago, California decided that certain rifles which had
previously been sold openly and without restriction were now to be
classified as "assault rifles," and owners were to fill out forms and
register them. (I don't recall if a fee was involved.)

(Some of you readers may, of course, think that such guns are in fact more
dangerous than, say, shotguns. This is not so, but this is also beside my
point. My point is not to argue that a Colt AR-15 with various cosmetic
features (such as "flash suppressor") should not be registered. Indeed, I
take it as a given that such registration is in violation of the Second
Amendment. Rather, my point is about the dangers of complying with such
registration laws.)

It turns out that the suckers who voluntarily registered the so-called
assault rifles they owned were subjected to _additional_ and _unwarranted_
delays in later purchases. The article below refers to some cases.

Not surprisingly, the act of voluntarily registering an "assault rifle"
placed one on a computerized list of suspicious citizen-units.

(I'm glad I had the presence of mind not to register my Colt AR-15, bought
in 1975, and having the "evil features" which the criminals in Congress
declared to be evil. Had I done so, I might have been unable to buy the
various guns I've bought recently.)

Although guns are not the same as crypto, and comparisons of crypto to
firearms are flawed, the lesson is that one should NEVER VOLUNTEER! No
doubt in 1999, when citizen-units are ordered to voluntarily register their
copies of assualt cryptography tools, those who step forward like lambs to
the slaughter will find themselves on lists of subversive citizen-units.
Yet more of a reason for Stego-PGP.
