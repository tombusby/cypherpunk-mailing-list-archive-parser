[Rant -- you touched a sore spot here, Rich.]
And I disagree with Rich, at least in regard to the present system. 

My "representative," is Ileanna Ros Lehtinen (R.). No Democrats have
chosen to run against her, and the Demopublican's beloved ballot laws
prevent me from running and actually getting on the ballot. I would
GLADLY vote for either Lucky Green or Black Unicorn if these nyms were
running against this statist woman, but I am not given that (or any
other) choice by the state. She has already "won" the "election," and
thus will NOT APPEAR on the ballot. The state of Florida assumes that
I would rather not vote for None Of The Above [NOTA], and my state is,
once again, wrong. The Florida Supreme Court is carefully ignoring the
Constitution(s) they all swore to uphold in these cases, and I am
trying to use any medium I can to trumpet this fact, so that solutions
like Mr. Bell's (yes, Jim, I know you have one for this, too) don't
start sounding better and better.  <sigh> :(
[End Rant]

P.S. Lucky & Uni: don't worry, I plan to [try to] write in "Jim Ray."

 Defeat the Duopoly! Vote "NOTA," not Slick/Dull in November.
 Harry Browne for President. Jo Jorgensen for Vice-president.
