Yeah, Matt, in a free society I wouldn't have to "speak Ebonics."

(Personally, I interviewed several folks while I was at Intel who could not
speak standard English. I recommended against their hiring, and they in
fact did not get invites to be interviewed at the main facilities. So much
for their jive talk habits.)

Understand, I have nothing against the colored people speaking "Ebonics" to
each other, or to anyone who'll listen. But I don't have to deal with this
nonsense, nor do I have to hire them.

(Until the People's Republic of Political Correctness demands that I
"justify" why not speaking standard English is a "valid job requirement,"
and refuses to take my "Because I say it is" as a valid answer. Not
surprisingly, the Clintonistas have decided to enter the Proposition 209
challenge on the side of the pro-discrimination side.)

If I were designing a genocidal program to destroy the colored race, I
would be pushing for Ebonics, for encouraging coloreds to study "Human
Potential" and "African History" instead of math, science, and engineering,
and pushing for hiring quotas.

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
