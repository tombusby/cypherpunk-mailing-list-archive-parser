I'm not familiar with SSL protocols, but something that would anonymize 
web page access and keep it entirely encrypted (not just credit card or 
forms transactions) would be good.

Encrypted/truly anonymous ftp would be nice (though some folx would 
understandably have problems with truly anonymous uploads, and crypto 
export restrictions in the US could be problematic legally).

I think there is already work on encrypted telnet (stel) by the CERT/IT 
people.

On the non-net side of things, implementing encrypted BBS/communications 
and file-transfers is useful.  I'm told PGP-Phone is supposed to support 
encrypted communications/file-transfers... so a host-script language that 
enables a simple BBS would be nice.

Implementing encrypted/anonymous mailing lists is another idea.

Other ideas?
