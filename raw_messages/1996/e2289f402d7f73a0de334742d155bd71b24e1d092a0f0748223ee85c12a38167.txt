True that some organization is asking the _government_ to
stop their competition?  I'm shocked!  Why, next thing you know
people will be asking the government to restrict imports of small cars,
restrict who can run radio stations, ban the hemp industry, 
tax imported sugar, or limit campaign contributions to non-incumbents.
("Not possible", you say - "that would be Un-American!")

Of course it's true.  Will the FCC do what they want?  Who knows;
it's stupid enough that they just might, but it may end up like the
Craig Shergold O'Hair Memorial Modem Tax with people writing them
crank letters for years after they've decided not to.
