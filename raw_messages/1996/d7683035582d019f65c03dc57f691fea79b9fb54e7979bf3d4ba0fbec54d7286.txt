this law got a little notice here although I didn't notice people
considering its identity aspects in particular.

this proposed law in Georgia 
would make it illegal to have a login name other than 
your legal name, as I understand it.

I consider it rather silly, naive, and unenforcable, 
but it does suggest a few things:

1. lawmakers are starting to notice the internet bigtime.
2. its starting to freak them out.
3. the identity issues raised by cyberspace have significant 
social implications and will not go away quietly.
4. there are some legitimate reasons to require ID in some places
in cyberspace.

of course I will be flamed on 4, but my position is, has always
been the following: both anonymous and "identified" communication
have their places. I am not suggesting that either one is superior
a priori.  however each has different uses. some things that
are possible in one are not possible in the other, etc.

I think it is reasonable
for people who create/maintain forums or other cyberspace services
to demand, and be able to enforce, that you use your real 
identity if they choose. likewise, you are free not to join these
place or use these services. I think anyone should be free
to create alternatives that spit in the face of these restrictions.
let the market decide what is most viable in given situations.

I suspect that we are going to see some laws being passed trying
to regulate cyberspace that are really ridiculous. it will take
the lawmakers awhile to figure out what they can and can't get away with
and when their opinions are or are not relevant to what happens.

meanwhile, if the internet really is robust, their irrelevant
posturings should not make much difference, although I am *not* 
advocating that people resign themselves to these laws, only that
if they pass the situation is not necessarily catastrophic or
apocalyptic.
