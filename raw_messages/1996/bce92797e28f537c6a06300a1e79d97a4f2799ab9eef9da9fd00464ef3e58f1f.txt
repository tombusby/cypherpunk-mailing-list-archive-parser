I suspect this may actually mean that they're pushing Netscape to
incorporate cryptographic authentication into browser email, which I think is
a useful development. I'm not aware of any public remailers previously 
operated by Netscape Communications Corp. that have now shut down. ;)

At any rate, it's an excuse for me to ask some questions:

(0) I'm not aware of any class library objects or methods in stand-alone Java
for calling the local mail transport agent. Is there any class library 
support in Java+{Navigator, HotJava, Mosaic, NetCruiser, the AOL web tool, 
etc.} for applet calls to the local mail agent that's configured in the 
browser ?  

I would prefer not to reimplement SMTP using the Socket class in my own 
applets. Ideally I'd like to have an applet that presents a form with some 
entry boxes and check boxes, quantizes and encrypts the input according to 
the check box settings, and spews the resulting byte streams to the MTA. 

(1) As I recall, I used to be able to set (as an Option) the path and name of 
the local MTA (e.g. /usr/lib/sendmail) in an earlier version of Netscape. 
That seems to have disappeared in Navigator 2.0. Is there indeed no longer a 
way to set that ?  

It occurs to me that we could have achieved partial integration of
remailing into Navigator quite cheaply with that option.

Comments from Sun and/or Netscape and/or anyone else would be welcome.
Thanks :)
