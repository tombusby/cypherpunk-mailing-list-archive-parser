Yes, windows95 dialup networking uses compression to send the password when connecting.

Problem Description=	Microsoft being security conscious and all, I would hope that when I connect to MSN over the Internet, that my MSN client has the decency to ENCRYPT my password when it sends it over the net,  yes?  This is the first time I couldn't get through to a dial-up connection and had to access MSN using my ISP.  Having done so, I find it extrememly convenient, and would like to continue to do so.  Thanks.
