Yep, I'm familiar with the issue.

Bottom line is, it'll take thousands of times the CPU power of the RC4-40
crack. Probably not 2^16 times more; I think RC4 has a longer
initialization.

I'm not talking about one individual or organization building one big DES
cracker. I'm thinking that DES chips _could_ be used to supliment the PCs
in a distributed crack. People with PCs would feed keyspace through their
PCs and people with DES chips could feed keyspace through their DES chips.
DES chips just happen to have a _lot_ more cracking power than PCs, so
they could make a big difference. Adding one DES chip would be like adding
hundreds of PCs to the effort. PCs will probably still be the main factor
simply because they're ubiquitous. 

Even with a bunch of DES chips and a massive legion of PCs, this is going
to take a long time. Perhaps we should be looking at the thousands of
computers and many months, more like the RSA-129 crack than the RC4-40
crack.

If Lenstra et al know what they're talking about, then WE CAN DO THIS!!!
