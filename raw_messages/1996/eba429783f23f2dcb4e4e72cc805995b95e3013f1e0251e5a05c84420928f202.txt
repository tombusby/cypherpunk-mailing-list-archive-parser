This more true than ever before.  Nowadays, banks commonly find
themselves in the mortgage origination business.  Once a mortgage is
originated, it is packed up with many similar mortgages and sold off
as a CMO.  This means the bank can specialize in what it is good at,
rather than speculating in interest risk.

The CMO market is intensely competitive.  Many people spend a lot of
time looking for misperceptions of default rates and the like.
Traders are not racists when they are trading, God bless their greedy
souls.  If it is really the case that mortgages are not being
originated irrationally, there is an unbelievable opportunity.
Originating mortgages does not require a great deal of capital and the
turn around of what investment is needed should be well under a year.

I would add that the purpose of the regulation is generally not to the
benefit of customers, but the banking guild.  Increased legislation
and control favors people who can afford lawyers or have the political
connections to prevent the need for lawyers.  Regulation favors the
established and not the poor Albanians.

Opening a bank should be as easy as forming a corporation.  There have
been brief periods in U.S. history when this was the case.  I have
heard it worked quite well.  Curiously, preferred stock in the banks
was such a liquid market that it became treated as cash.  Instead of
making a deposit, you could buy some preferred stock.  Note that this
solves rather elegantly the problem of bank runs.
