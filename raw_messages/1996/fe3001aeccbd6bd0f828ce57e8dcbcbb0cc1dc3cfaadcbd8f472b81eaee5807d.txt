   "Louis W. Tordella, 84, Who Helped Break Cerman Military
   Code in World War II."

      A mathematician who helped break Enigma, and later 
      spent 16 years as the deputy director of the National 
      Security Agency. An intelligence visionary who had 
      helped create and shape NSA even before he became its
      deputy director in 1958, Dr. Tordella was regarded both
      as a pioneer in the development of ever more powerful
      and sophisticated computers to break enemy codes and as
      a master administrator who established a combined 
      code-breaking operation and then ran it.

      Since decryption devices did not exist, he and his
      colleagues simply designed and built them, not only
      breaking the enemy codes but helping to lay the
      theoretical and practical groundwork for what has become
      a vast computer industry.
