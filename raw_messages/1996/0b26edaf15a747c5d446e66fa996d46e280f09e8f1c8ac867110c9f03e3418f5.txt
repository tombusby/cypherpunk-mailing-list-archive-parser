I think they are refering to Java scripting in this article.  (You have to
remember that such articles are phrased for those who have little or no
technical knowledge.)

I find it amazing though that they claim a two week release date when I have
not heard of a Java version for the Mac as of yet.  I would think that they
would have put it through at least one beta first.  (But then again, this is
netscape we are talking about...)

[Note to Jeff and other Netscape employees: I realize you have gotten
better.  Lets hope it stays that way. (And I won't make *any* comments about
"tech support".]
