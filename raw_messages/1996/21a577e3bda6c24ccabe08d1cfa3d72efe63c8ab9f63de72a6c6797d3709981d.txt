Actually looting of companies happens a lot right now today, and very
seldom leads to criminal charges.  Twice I have lost a job because the
company I worked for went under, apparently due to looting.

At present venture capitalists seem to rely on the sniff-their-arses
method.  They talk to people and try and get a feel as to whether they
are planning a robbery.  This method is obviously likely to be less
effectual as businesses move to the net.

This problem is probably the major reason why Net startups are physically 
located in Silicon valley, rather than world wide or nation wide.  Of course
the problem is that if the venture capitalists can find them to sniff
their arses, the bad boys can also find them to shake them down.

In some businesses we can solve this problem by cryptographic control
mechanisms, such as open books banking.  In others, such as net startups,
I see no solution other than increased reliance on personal individual
capital.

Athenian capitalism worked largely on personal capital.  Because of their
terrible arithmetic system, bookkeeping was really bad, and in consequence
stock investments tended to go sour.  Socrates lost a bundle in this 
fashion, which may explain his lack of enthusiasm for capitalists.

It will work for many particular cases of this problem.
