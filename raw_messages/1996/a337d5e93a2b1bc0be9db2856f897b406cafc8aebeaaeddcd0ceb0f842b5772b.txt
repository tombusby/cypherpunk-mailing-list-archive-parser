It's a pity, Eric, that before coming down off the mountain, you didn't
stop to understand the real attack we're outlining.  I expected that
even if you didn't like what we were doing, you'd take the time to
understand it rather than embarass yourself.

The fact that PC's don't have perfect integrity is only *one* of the
four known vulnerabilities -- keyboard sniffing being another -- that we
have combined into a comprehensive, devastating attack that has never
been publicly mentioned before.

I've already written it.  So what?  Stealing or forging a single
transaction is EASY in almost ANY commerce system ever invented.    The
flaw we've uncovered in encrypted credit cards allows a single criminal
to automate the theft of millions of card numbers.  That's a very
different story.

> Encryption isn't the issue, Nathaniel, and you know it.  

Not only do I know it, I ***SAID*** it.  It's painfully obvious that you
didn't read our announcements very carefully, so I'll excerpt the
relevant paragraph:

The issue is definitely not encryption.  The issue is that credit card
numbers are self-identifying one-way payment instruments, and there's no
way to make such instruments safe to use on insecure consumer computing
platforms.  The only reason that encryption even enters the discussion
is that there are OTHER parties who are claiming that their software
encryption products make such payment instruments safe.  They don't. 
That's all we're pointing out.

Yes.  But the BIGGEST risk that an Internet payments provider has to
deal with is the threat of large-scale, systematic, automated fraud. 
And *that* is the hole we have just blown in the
software-encryption-of-credit-card schemes, and which you clearly didn't
take the time to understand.

Well, I think our financial industry partners will take our "clueless"
level of risk management any day.  We have fraud and chargeback rates so
low that they're scarcely believeable, because nearly all fraud AND
dissatisfied customers are caught by the email loop and never make it
into the credit card system in the first place.  Our acquiring bank
thinks that's pretty neat, I think.  In fact, it's worth noting that
after being our acquiring bank for over a year of live operation, and
having the most inside information possible about how our system works,
First USA Bank (one of the nation's largest credit card banks) made a
large equity investment in us last month.  Do you really think they
didn't do any risk analysis? -- Nathaniel
