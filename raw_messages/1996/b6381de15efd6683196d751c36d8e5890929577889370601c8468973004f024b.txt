	Development of an Open and Flexible Payment System

	Abstract: The Internet is in need of a simple, open, flexible
	and secure payment system. Many payment systems that currently
	exist are either proprietary, insecure, inflexible or all three.
	This paper examines the types of payment system in use today, the
	payment system requirements of Systemics Ltd., an overview of the
	Systemics Open Transaction (SOX(tm)) payments system that was
	developed, and a summary of how this system met the requirements.

	The SOX payment system is currently in live use for a bond trading
	system, and a reference implementation will shortly be made
	available on the Internet.
