You can't.  Anyone who claims to be able to do so is betting their scanning
ability against the collective programming skill of hundreds of
brilliant-but-twisted programmers/hackers.   Remember CHK4BOMB? The old DOS
program that would dump strings from an EXE so you could look for things
like "Happy birthday yoshi"?  They started encrypting and adding
polymorphing and stealthing and . . .

Now you could write a program that would scan for more 'obvious' attacks but
it will probably be a continual catch-up game.  You don't even have the
ability to do checksumming of existing files (like you do w/virii).
