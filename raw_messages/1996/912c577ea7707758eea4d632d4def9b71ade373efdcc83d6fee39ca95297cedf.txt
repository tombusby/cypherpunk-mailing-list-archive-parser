What part of the archives?
----------------
	Good question. I looked then wiped the information (the word processor
I use to take notes has a limited amount of memory). Lewis?

>That's a good solution.  Another idea might be to stego the 
accounting info (real info ;) inside one of pictures using a similar 
method.... in some ways this method is better suited for stego since 
it becomes lunacy for the cops to insist that every picture or 
audiofile  you have has something or many things hidden... (unless 
they've been watching you and know you keep accessing your jodi 
foster pix after a client visits you...)

	Yes, although that also increases the diffficulty involved and the
space required (like using my highly-multiple-messages idea). I can see both
methods having their points. However, you'd still need to have _some_ pictures
that had info that you were willing to release, otherwise they'd just find the
stego program and convince a judge that you were lying and defying the search
warrant/court order when you claimed you hadn't used it.
