Well, I used "entropy" in the usual sense of the constellation of definitions:

- low entropy means increased predictability (in this case, Alice and Bob
are more able to "predict" what the other will decide than if the points
were more "random")

- low entropy is associated with "less randomness" (randomness is a
notoriously controversial subject, discussed here often, so please don't
clutter the list with quibbles about randomness)

- "random" is related to "unpredictable" is related to "not compressible"
is related to "disorderly"

- "nonrandom" is related to "predictable"  is related to "compressible" is
related to "orderly"


Schelling points are of course related to the notion of "emergent order,"
in that order emerges without prior communication between Alice and Bob.
