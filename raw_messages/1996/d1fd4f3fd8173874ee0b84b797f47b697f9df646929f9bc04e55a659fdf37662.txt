The specific attack referred to had an entire encrypted message, not
just a reply block.  Obviously this solution does not work if only a
reply block is encrypted.

Even worse, it requires manual intervention for each attack unless you
are willing to add reply blocks to the list based simply on the volume
of messages using that reply block.  That could prevent the remailer
network being overwhelmed, but is not likely to be seen as adequate by
the target, who would likely still see the first several dozen
messages before the specified threshold was reached.

There is another related solution for the attack using just a reply
block, however.  The final remailer could collect messages either
using a given reply block, or addressed to a given address, if more
that a few were received in a relatively short period of time.  It
could then forward the first half-dozen or so, along with a note that
another X thousand messages were waiting, and asking if the intended
recipient wanted them forwarded or trashed.

Unfortunately this would not prevent the remailer network from being
overwhelmed.  Perhaps some combination of these solutions would be
required -- rationing based on the reply block at each remailer, and
collection & recipient notification at the final remailer.
