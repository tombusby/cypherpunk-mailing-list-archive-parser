If he has more than eight bits of timing resolution, such biases will
have no affect.

He is using his non uniformly distributed random number to select a
uniformly distributed pseudo random number.

Provided that the does not attempt to get more entropy out than he
puts in, the result should be a uniformly distributed truly random
number.
