Y'all:

Effective immediately, the WinSock Remailer (operating at 
winsock@c2.org) will now accept only PGP encrypted messages.
All incoming messages (with the exception of messages with
subject headers of help, remailer-help, remailer-stats, and
remailer-key) must now be encrypted with the public key for
winsock@c2.org.  All other messages will be rejected.

Regards,
