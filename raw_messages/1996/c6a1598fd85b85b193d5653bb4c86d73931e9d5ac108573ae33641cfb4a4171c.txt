 SAMPLE LETTER

The Honorable                        
Address
Washington, DC  20515

Dear Rep. ____________:

I have learned that Section 1201 of the NII Copyright Protection Act
(H.R. 2441) could take away my right to use new digital video
technology for my personal recording. It also could delay or even
prevent these new products from being available to consumers.

If I record television programs, I do it for my personal use and
convenience. The Supreme Court's "Betamax" decision confirmed my right
to do this. Section 1201 will change the current law so that I may not
be able to do this in the future with new digital video products.

I understand that a House subcommittee vote on this bill is planned
for next week. I realize that the copyright issue is complex, but
please remember to protect my rights as a consumer. I hope you will
vote against H.R. 2441 as drafted. Will you please let me know your
position on this issue?

Sincerely,

YOUR NAME
Thank you.
