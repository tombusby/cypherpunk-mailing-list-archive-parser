In general, I think this foundation should limit itself to:

(1) Supporting the creation of techniques for anonymous communication (e.g
remailers, nym servers etc.)  This could include grants for theoretical
work and grants for the production of out-of-the-box public domain systems.

(2) Public education on the need and value of anonymous communication.

(3) Demonstration projects to help create a market where none exists.

Whenever there is a market, the foundation, like governments, should not
participate as a competitor.
