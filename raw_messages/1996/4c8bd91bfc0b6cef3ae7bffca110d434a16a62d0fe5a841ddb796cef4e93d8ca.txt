The exchange of information among many trusted people all located in the
same geographical location (or with regular reliable couriers travelling to
different locations) is the ideal situation for *private* not public key
crypto. In such circumstances one uses, e.g. IDEA, not PGP. 
 
End of corporate problem. End of "worry" about problems with PGP.
