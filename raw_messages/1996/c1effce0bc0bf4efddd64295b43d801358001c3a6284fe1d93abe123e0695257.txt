Sounds like an interesting way to secure a remailer.  (Especially against
Scientology raids.  "This remailer will self-destruct in five seconds." *BOOM*)

There was a case locally where some idiot booby-trapped his cache of weapons
and explosives.  Seemed a wee bit self-defeating.  (Blew all of his
explosives all over the place when it finally went off.  No one was hurt,
but it spread grenades and other choice bits all over the place.)  The local
kids got alot of souveneers out of that one...
