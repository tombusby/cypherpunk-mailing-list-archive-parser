You lack specifics.  And how applicable are these to a person like Colby?

Who said "conspiracy"?  If Colby wanted to disappear, are you trying to 
suggest that he wouldn't have been able to engineer this himself?  The word 
"conspiracy" requires the actions of more than one person, or have you 
forgotten?  If anything, your misuse of the word "conspiracy" reveals your 
knee-jerk thought processes.

If the guy went out, alone, in a canoe in (reportedly) 2-foot waves without 
a life vest, the term "intelligence" is doubly wasted on him.

What a brainless statement!  Quite the opposite, I didn't claim to be "in 
the know."  Rather, I merely pointed out that what was being said by others 
about the incident was without appreciable support and rather inconsistent 
and not believeable, and very much inadequate.  I can do this very 
effectively without knowing, for certain, what really did happen.

I'm starting no rumors.  Rather, if anything, I'm ATTACKING a rumor being 
portrayed as fact:  The rumor that he died in a canoeing accident.
