	While survivors and their relatives are certainly the most hurt by
such, I would like to mention that the insults in question also include those
who allegely lied about the camps. My grandfather (Ltc. (Ret.) William H.
Smith) was directly behind the front lines in his Army Intelligence work
(document gathering and sorting at that point). He and his sergeant were the
first Allied discoverers of one of the camps- I believe Dachau. Moreover, he
was in charge of the Paris Documents Center at one point. I don't like his
being called a liar.
	Despite that, I still regard Holocaust Revisionists as having free
speech rights. It's just if they try to recreate Krystallnacht (sp?) that I
want them dead.
