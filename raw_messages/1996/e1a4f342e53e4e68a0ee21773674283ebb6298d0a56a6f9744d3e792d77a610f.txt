Yes, that would be great, and a trial run for the Big Prize, China.

At the site mentioned above, they have a form to fill out, which only
people from Singapore are supposed to respond to, which asks a 
lot of questions, including how much censorship users consider
appropriate! If there is some way of making them think the response
is coming from within Singapore when actually it isn't, maybe we 
could flood them with responses saying we want no censorship?
