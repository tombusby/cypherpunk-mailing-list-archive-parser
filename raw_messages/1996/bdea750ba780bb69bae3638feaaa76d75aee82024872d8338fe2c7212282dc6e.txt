I agree with Jean-Francois--most of the recent announcements by governments
about the Internet actually indicate *full awareness* of what their actions
could mean for the propagation of articles, the extradition of
Net.criminals, and the development of a Global New World Computer Order.

The United States knew what the CDA would mean, the government of Bavaria
knew what the crackdown on "racist" Web sites and newsgroups would mean,
the government of Singapore understands full well what their actions could
mean, and so on.

And it is likely that the "control" advocates in each of these countries
(and others) are pleased when one of their brother countries announces new
crackdowns on the Net and Web. Very few governments actually like free
speech in all of its forms, and certainly the U.S. government does not.
Sure, there is lip service paid to "free speech" in the U.S., but the list
of illegal things to say keeps getting longer (just last week Clinton
illegalized many forms of speech involving cigarettes--what part of
"Congress shall make no law" is not being understood here?).

As to why so many of the criticisms of such crackdowns use "weasel
language," such as the example Jean-Francois disagrees with, well, this is
the way the game is played. The alternative to "The government of Singapore
fails to understand the nature of the Net and could do grievous harm to it"
is not quite so diplomatic:

"Fucking statists. Time to nuke 'em back to the stone age."

Personally, if this crackdown in Singapore happens, I intend to post
various anti-Singapore and anti-Lee Kwan Yew & Sons screeds to various
newsgroups that Singaporans might like to read. Then, if the Yew Dynasty
decides to pull the plug, it'll be to more and more groups.
