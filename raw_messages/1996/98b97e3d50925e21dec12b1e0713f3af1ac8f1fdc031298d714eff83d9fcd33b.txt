A couple of people have pointed out what he was talking about,
one of which is below.  I haven't been able to find an article on
the web that does more than reference the event.  I'll try to hunt
up one of the books.  If anyone cares, I'll post what I find later.

I suspect that Dmitri is referring to the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  
It's not a pretty story and is one of the low points of Mormon 
history.

The late historian Juanita Brooks wrote about the masscre, and about 
the leader, John D. Lee, in a couple of books.
