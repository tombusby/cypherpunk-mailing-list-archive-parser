Another interesting question is how you do personnel selection for an
anonymous enterprise.  One possibility would be anonymous reputation
passing, but I don't know any protocols for this.  A participant would also
want to take any positive reputation accruing away when the enterprise
finished.  (And the rest of us would want any negative reputation to stick
as well.)
