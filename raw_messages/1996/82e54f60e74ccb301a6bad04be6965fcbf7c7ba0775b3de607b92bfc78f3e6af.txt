Probibly a variation on the Macrovision copy protection scheme.  Of course
they do not care that such copyprotection methods usually cause a loss in
signal quality.  (Which is why people buy laser discs in the first place.)

Hopefully it will be something that never succeeds in the marketplace.
(Although i expect it to be imposed whether the consumer wants it or not or
how bad it screws up the signal.)
