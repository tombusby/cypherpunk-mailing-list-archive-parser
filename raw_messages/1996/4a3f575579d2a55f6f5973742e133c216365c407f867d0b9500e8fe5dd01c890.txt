	JYA has the complete version of this, but I wanted to make a
comment that this allegedly pro-consumer group is wanting mandatory
receipts - decidedly anti-privacy. Typical; Consumer Reports keeps calling
for limits on what can be made available instead of making the information
available and letting people decide on their own. There is also the
problems associated with welfare-on-a-card - namely limits on what can be
purchased, a requirement for full identity disclosures, etcetera. I'd call
this effort by government also a form of the pressure-by-economics we saw
with the initial Clipper proposal (leaving aside the actual agenda), namely
using government purchasing to distort the market (away from anonymous
digital cash, in this case). The last statement also brings up the question
of why shouldn't banks move out of high-crime areas? I'd appreciate lower
bank fees, and so would most people.

>   The Federal Reserve has issued proposals on whether the consumer
>   protections guaranteed for other electronic-funds transfers -- like
>   direct deposits and debit cards -- will apply to stored-value card
>   purchases. These protections include the requirement of receipts with
>   every purchase and a limit on liability if a card is lost or stolen.
   
>   The Fed has proposed that card systems that cannot hold more than $100

>   To deal with this, various groups of state governments are developing

>   One of the thorniest issues is whether holders of these welfare cards
>   get the same protections as holders of credit and debit cards issued
