Not that full anonymity isn't a Good Thing, but couldn't this be solved by
having the merchant (who presumably is on-line) provide PDA <-> mint
connectivitiy for the purposes of getting change, exchanging coins, etc.?
My assumption is that all the ecash protocols are not subject to a MITM
attack, which I would just presume to be good practice.

Also, given the fully anonymous protocol as you've described it (both payor
and payee blind the coins), what's to prevent the merchant from depositing
your change before he gives it to you? Unless your PDA is online, you'll be
home before you find out the hot dog vendor shorted you. (It's my
understanding that the current digicash system does not support Chaum's
method of revealing the identity of double-spenders).
