Hmm. What about the following:

  Use a constant (non-weak) key for a cipher (perhaps the hash of 
  the passphrase under certain circumstances?)

  For iteration-0, CFB (or some other feedback mode)-encrypt the
  passphrase from the input buffer   to the output buffer (assuming the
  library doesn't require that the plaintext and ciphertext be in the same
  buffer)

  For following iterations, repeatedly CFB-encrypt the buffer,
  using a counter in data bytes.

This method could use hash algorithms in MDC or Luby-Rackoff forms
as well as block ciphers (and perhaps some stream ciphers).

Another method might be to seed a PRNG similar to that used in PGP 
2.x with the passphrase, have it stir the bytes a number of times, 
and then use the output as the key:

  randPoolAddBytes(passphrase, passlen);
  for(i=0;i<iterationCount;i++) randPoolStir();
  randPoolGetBytes(key, keylen);

Questions: Are you using the previous chaining-variables/hash for 
each successive chunk?  How do you pad passphrases that are smaller 
than the minimum input for a hash function?
