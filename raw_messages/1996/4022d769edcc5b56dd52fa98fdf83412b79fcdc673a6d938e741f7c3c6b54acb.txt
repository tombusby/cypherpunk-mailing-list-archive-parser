Quite true, and the same thing I was told by the Chief-Editor
of "Info" (the weekly Internet-supplement of a prominent Greek
journal -Eleftherotypia).

One last comment is important here:

******************************************************************
If the 'neo-liberal' ideology of EVERYTHING becoming 'privatised'
succeeds, then non-governmental censorship is MUCH more important
the governmental censorship.
******************************************************************

The Internet is a threat to the 'traditional' role of the media,
and 'list-owners' try tp behave like patronising conventional
newspaper-editors. All the filth that was hidden in the closet
of the journalistic profession comes out, as a result, in the
Net. These people want to _model_ mailing lists after journals
-ironically at a time when many journalists are free to write
what they like sometimes against the opinions of the journal-owners.

Perhaps our only hope is that... Freedom sells.
