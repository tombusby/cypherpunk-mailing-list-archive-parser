Some comments (off the top of my head):

* What kind of encryption? [The article says RSA. ] How big is the key?
* Why encrypt before compression? If the encryption is any good, then the
encrypted data won't compress much at all. However, compression before
encryption has its own problems.
* Who does the key management (if any)?
* Does MCI store copies of the keys used?
* How does MCI authenticate users who request copies of files, and do they
then return them encrypted or as plaintext? If encrypted, how does the
recepient decryt the files? (He/she just had a disk crash, and this is
their backup medium, remember?)

I looked on MCI's web site <http://www.mci.com>, but couldn't find
anything. Besides, it's slower than sludge. [ 90 secs/page over my 128K
link. :-( ]
