        ah, yeah, the doodads, the big doodads. 

        ...seems like these to ol' 'Nam buddies were hanging off the 
    bars one night when one stops and backs up his scooter to see a 
    billboard:

        "1000 yards ahead. Ruby's Bar. She'll pay you $1,000 
        for every inch your big thang hangs past your doodads!"
    
        Big Mike yells over the roar of the unmuffled engines: "we're
    stopping at Ruby's.  they putt ahead to a roadhouse; behind the
    bar is an attractive woman;  Big Mike says he's on for the ruler;
    she motions him to a back room: "...what ya got?"

        Big Mike slaps his big thang on the table; Ruby whistles with
    lust and asks: "...but where are your doodads"

        unfazed: "Saigon!"
