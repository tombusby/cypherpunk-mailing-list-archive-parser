Umm, okay, great. So we eliminate all the spam, all the harrassment,
all the frivolous anonymous mail, everyone who uses anon remailers as
a matter of course, and what do you get? One message slowly going
through the system, tracked every step of the way by <indert evil org
here>. Message reordering doesn't help much with one message. The
remailer net *needs* traffic. Preventing spammers is one thing,
discouraging use of remailers in general is another.

I suggest that US$.15 to US$.05 per message would be quite reasonable
compensation. The price can't be high enough to make people think
about it, unless they're going to send lots of messages.

This pricing strategy would greatly serve the cause of traffic
analysis. There has to be enought delay to collect enought messages to
do some reordering. You could send out bogus messages, but iy wouldn't
be too too difficult to track them far enough to see that they don't
go anywhere interesting.

That's why you would PGP encrypt the cash. "Trust? What's that, I've
got (ta da) STRONG CRYPTO!"

If remailer prices were trivial, I don't think this would happen.
Besides, chaingin blows this away. The only time an ad gets delivered
to a person is when the advertising remailer delivers it to its final
destination. 

Interesting... those interested in not having to put lots of effort
into management operate internal-only remailers, those interested in
making a buck operate termious-only remailers...

Whee. Diversity. The species evolves.
