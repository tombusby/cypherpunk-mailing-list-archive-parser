Dear Decius, 
 
I greatly enjoyed your post on this topic at the cpyherpunks list. 
 
On a related issue, I have been giving a lot of thought to the possibility
of moving the functional aspect of anon servers away from professionally
administered and globally known sites like C2 to many smaller virtually
unknown sites. 
 
I have been informed that the latest Sysquest parallel port 135 Mb drive
lets you boot off of it, (e.g. load the driver off a floppy then boot a new
OS off the Sysquest.) This permits one to put a linux kernal, lots of
utilities, pgp, mixmaster, etc. etc. on the single $20 floppy drive, along
with an easy to use and understand interface for the "sysop." 
 
People can then have a complete mixmaster etc. system regardless of what OS
they use on their regular machine, resident on a floppy easy to hide and
cheap enough to destroy. It would lead to an enormous number of sites
popping up among jr. high school students in the family garage or rec room
through undregrads in their dorm rooms. Access would be mainly through
personal friendships and word of mouth. 
 
Makes it almost infinitely more difficult for government to track them down
let alone clamp down.
