It is well-known that photons are affected by gravitation...from the
Mossbauer effect to the bending of light by the sun (seen in eclipses) to
the gravitational lensing effects.

What is being referred to is a term of art related to Bose-Einstein
statistics (the origin of the term boson, as contrasted to fermions, which
are affected by the Pauli Exclusion Principle, while bosons are not).

No list relevance that I can see, but then neither do nuclear triggers have
anything to do with the list.
