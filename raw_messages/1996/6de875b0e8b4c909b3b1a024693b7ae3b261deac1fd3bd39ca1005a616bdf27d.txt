In what sense do you believe I am given a "privelige" to own what I 
do.

Your very attitude implies some form of statism, in that you believe 
some higher authority has the right to remove that which I lawfully 
accumulated, this is the position taken by those who support the idea 
of taxation etc.

Explain further, if you will, what you mean by this being a 
privelige. In what cases do you believe I do not have the right to 
retain my property?
