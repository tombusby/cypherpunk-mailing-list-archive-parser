Actually, a 12-gage shotgun is approximately .73 caliber.  Maybe it was a 
16-gage?  BTW, many "real terrorist incidents" are acknowledged by the group 
committing them, so that they will win support for their "cause," or notoriety, 
or whatever other gratification their sick minds might derive from carnage.  The 
fact that no one has claimed responsibility for the bombing skews the 
perpetrator probabilities more toward a single disturbed individual or a 
Reichstag rehash.

The chupa-cabras, Grays, and the Art Bell Fan Club would file an EEOC 
class-action lawsuit, citing preferential treatment for beings that "the average 
citizen" actually BELIEVES in.  More lawyer-bait.
