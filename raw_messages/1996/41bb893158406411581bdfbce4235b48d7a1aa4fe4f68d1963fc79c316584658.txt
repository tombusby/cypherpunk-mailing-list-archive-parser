I've finally managed to get my hack at a Win95-based remailer done. I've settled on RemailerBot for a name, an this will be version .9b(eta). It isn't pretty, and there isn't a whole lot of functionality to it yet (remailing, reorder, automagically kills subject lines, handles both anon-to and request-remailing-to). But at least it's *something*; I'll start adding to it ASAP. I'll have the (_heavily_ commented)  source (written in VB4 Pro, heh) available on my web page in a day or two (probably need to figure on Monday :-). Anyone wants it before then, email me and I'll zip it up and email it to you (state your preference for MIME or uuencoding).

Many thanks to the kind folks who sent 'anonymous mail' to me via my webmaster identity so that I'd have some 'real' remailer messages to play with.

Brief description of it is that it reads what Seattle Labs software (purveyors of SLMail95) assures me is a 'standard unix' .mbx file, separates it into component messages, processes them, and dumps the results into an outbox directory. It deletes (not wipes [yet]) any intermediate files. Wiping isn't a big priority (I think) because of Win95's System Agent which can run a defrag utility periodically.

My feature priorities are PGP first, followed by latency, then the rest. If there's anyone out there that can read VB source _and_ knows what a .mbx file really looks like, I'd appreciate having a cross-check on my parsing. Right now, it's SLMail-specific, and I'd like to be able to make sure it can handle a little more variety.
