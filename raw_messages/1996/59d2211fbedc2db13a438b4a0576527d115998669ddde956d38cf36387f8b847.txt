	Fascinating. I'd still say to use PGP when sending mail when possible
in order to give the NSA more to worry about in traffic analysis. However, it
does look like Leahy isn't exactly a governmental type to whom I wish to send
an encouraging message. This may explain the problems with his initial bill
on cryptography export.

	Why do you think I enquired about encryption in the Internet Phone
software in Netscape? Deployment of such as soon as possible - with the
encrypted version being the default, or even automatic - would be a decided
help.

	One question is whether the ISP will be able to detect whether someone
is violating such a law.
