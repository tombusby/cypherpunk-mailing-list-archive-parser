The only person I know of to announce such a project was Ray Cromwell. His
Decense project was discussed on this list briefly in February.  I believe
the source is still posted at <http://www.clark.net/pub/rjc/decense.html>.
I've tried to contact Ray to get an up date on progress, but without
results.

The shortcoming of Ray's approach is that it requires intermediate servers
to re-route all client-server packets and therefore someone must provide
that, considerable, bandwidth for free or fee.

If someone were to set up a real-time BlackNet it could provide a superset
of Decense and also offer considerably improved anonymity.  I've heard some
months ago that such a project is under consideration.
