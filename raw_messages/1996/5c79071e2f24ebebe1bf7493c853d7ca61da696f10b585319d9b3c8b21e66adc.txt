        yes, and that was the intent.

	I do not think the intent of those of us who formed 
   Coderpunks "conspired to form an elitest group."  The basic problem 
   was simple --even code topics were politicized in cypherpunks which 
   resulted in scores and days of "re: " messages until someone finally 
   prefaced it with [NOISE], or changed the subject.

        as to jim bell, does this imply you believe in censorship?

        I think you are mistaken with your implication that tcmay is a 
   racist. Bigotry, etc. is usually created in the mind of a reader who
   jumps to conclusions.  I am somewhat older than tim, and I find the
   politically correct revisionism even more humourous (and very
   intellectually cheap):  vertically challenged, horizontally
   challenged, mobility challenged, mentally challenged, or whatever    
   the current fads are.

        and, to top it off, I am disgusted with the high and mighty 
   moralism of the revisionists. I fully agree with EEO, but I 
   thoroughly disagree with quotas and preferences.  I have more than 
   an even tendency to call a spade a spade, and I may live where guns   
   tend to outnumber our many children, but the only way a stranger can 
   be bounced from my table is to interfer with grace --and there are 
   some, as they are attending for the extra plate which is always set, 
   who would protest that my prayer offends them. does anybody still 
   have manners?

        tim finds humour in many things --and, he has the courage to
   challenge the politically correct revisonism which is being shoved
   down our throats by a bigger and bigger, but certainly not better,
   creeping vine of vipers we call our government, which is nothing 
   more than a ship of fools.

        well, the premise may be correct on what cypherpunks drifts 
   into with the endless political back and forth --the open forum;  
   however, the creation of the cesspit is not one party's fault  --we 
   _all_ have contributed to the problem --which is compounded by 
   direct, on-line connections.

        so, how about a little moderation in all things?
