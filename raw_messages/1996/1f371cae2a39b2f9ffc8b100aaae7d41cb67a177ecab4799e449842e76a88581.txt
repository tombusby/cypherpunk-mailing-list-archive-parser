	Private individuals are not what I was refering to. I am more
concerned about corporations who hold information about me and release it
to the highest bidder. When it comes to individual versus corporate
rights, I am clearly on the side of the individual. 
	It is not unreasonable to expect corporations to comply with 
environmental laws to prevent the poisoning of our air and water. I 
think that it is also not unreasonable to expect that personal 
information that we have to release to participate in society be held in 
secure trust and be used only for the purposes that we released it in the 
first place.
	I have also not suggested some form of prior restraint that would 
require government access to computers. I simply suggest that should a 
violation occur, that I have the right of civil and criminal law as a 
recourse to both compensate me for my loss of privacy as well as deter 
future damage. A company knowing that civil and criminal penalties could 
result from a violation would take extra care to ensure the security of 
my data.
