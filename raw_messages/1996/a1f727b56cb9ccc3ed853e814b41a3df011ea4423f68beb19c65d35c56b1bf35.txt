Other Arab states had mutual defense treaties with Iraq which
would have obligated them to enter the war on the side of Iraq
were there a conflict between Iraq and Israel.  This would have
greatly complicated the Persian Gulf War, and put the United
States in a very difficult position.

The sad part is that Israel required any persuasion or guarantees
at all by the United States to refrain from upsetting the
applecart, especially since the US was doing its best to defend
Israel at the time.

And while the Israelis celebrated and danced in the streets, all
prospects for a lasting negotiated Middle East peace would have
been screwed for the next several centuries.

The Israelis take very good care of themselves with the weapons,
military intelligence, and billions in US aid they receive each
year.  Occasional requests by the United States that they
exercise appropriate discretion are hardly out of line.
