I suppose that's why Clinton called himself a "libertarian" when it comes to 
gay rights. (Calling yourself something and actually *being* that something 
are, of course, different things.)

Phill, you need to listen more and talk less about libertarian politics, I 
first heard about various wild-sounding now "mainstream" ideas when talking 
with Libertarians. These ideas are now promoted by members of both parties, 
especially during the election campaign season. For one thing, we were 
probably the first party to have a policy against government restrictions on 
the peaceful use of cryptography.
