And I agree, too.

I can support "data privacy laws" when the government is the party affected
by the laws. (Though, being somewhat cynical and having seen many cases
where governments conveniently exempted themselves from laws or simply
ignored them, I am not hopeful that any data privacy laws will have the
intended effect.)
