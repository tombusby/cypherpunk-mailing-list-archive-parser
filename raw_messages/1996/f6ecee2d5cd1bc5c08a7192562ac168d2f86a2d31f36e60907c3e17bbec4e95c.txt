Oh no! - I`ve been netcopped on the CommUnity list *AGAIN*, long live 
cypherpunks, the last bastion of free speech on the net!!!! ;-)

But seriously, this does highlight what we are up against, when 
CommUnity (for US readers CommUnity, abreviated CU sometimes, is like 
a UK version of the EFF), supposedly a free speech and online 
liberties organisation, has posters (and this one is pretty typical) 
like this which clearly cover all debate on a subject area as 
"padophilia" if they try to explore the issues any more deeply than 
saying that fucking children is wrong...
