But, would the average jury understand what a RNG is? The prosecution
would probably argue that "It's a tool used by terrorists and child
pornographers so that they can create 'codes' to communicate with each
other". If they say that, they could probably even supress any
explaination of what a RNG actually is, by claiming that it's "to
dangerous to allow into public record". The Phrack E911 document was
supressed in that way. 

In some countries I could see people being charged with an offence just
for having a RNG... The output looks encrypted, and I heard that in France
(and other countries) it is illegal to create anything that even *looks*
encrypted. :(
