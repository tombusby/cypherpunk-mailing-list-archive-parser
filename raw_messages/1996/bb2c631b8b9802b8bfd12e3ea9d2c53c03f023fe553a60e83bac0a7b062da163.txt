   1-28-96. TWP:

   "Informant's Revelations on Cali Cartel Implicate Colombian
   Officials."

      Inside the counterintelligence center for notorious Cali
      drug lord Jose Santacruz Londono was an IBM AS/400
      computer storing coded information that listed thousands
      of bribes awarded by the Cali cartel to many individuals
      known collectively as "Caso 8000." The cartel's sysadmin
      has been decoding the computer's data and implicating
      officials from Colombian government, politics, the
      military and the entertainment industry.

      He later would be indicted as part of a major
      racketeering case brought by federal prosecutors in
      Miami against U.S. lawyers who allegedly have protected
      Cali interests here and abroad -- three private lawyers
      who are former federal prosecutors, including one who
      served as a high-ranking Justice Department official.

   TWP has a followup on the AOL raid, mostly a police story
   grisler on the cyber-prowling horny-cats. Has ICU of the
   terminal logoff by a 13-year-old nerd. The fuz posted a
   call-in for anon tips:

      "You know how many we've gotten from our on-line hot
      line? Not one. It's like they have this fantastic world
      they operate in, and we are seen as intruders or
      something."
