Even the best cryptographers and security professionals have done this.
RSA did it with their Public Key system, which took 20+ years to break.
Throughout history, many security mechanisms, even the best ones,
including Cyphers, Locks, Firewalls, etc. have been known to go as far as
to offer prizes (some extremely high, upwards of a million dollars, some
as low as RSA's famous $100 prize)

I think that this one really is just a bit too broad.
