I had intended to respond to Bill Stewart's comment before this.  I was 
surprised that he would suggest that AP would (necessarily?) cause "more 
violence."  To me, it's obvious that it will cause _different_ violence, and 
I strongly suspect it'll actually reduce the total violence level, and 
certainly will do so in the long term.  But far more than reducing violence, 
it'll reduce coercion that doesn't rise to the level of violence as well.  
When people AREN'T put in jail or prison for a victimless crime, I consider 
that a drastic reduction in coercion, and that's progress.  Put fewer people 
in jail, and you anger fewer people, and you rob fewer people by taxation to 
pay for that jail, etc.

Not only that, you could use AP to kill somebody who killed SOMEBODY ELSE 
with AP!  (which is, to me, a rather obvious fact, but one that escapes an 
unusually large number of people.  'course, you'd have to figure out who did 
it... a non-trivial task under the circumstances.)
