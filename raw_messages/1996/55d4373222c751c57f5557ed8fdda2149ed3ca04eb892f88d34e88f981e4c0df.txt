Just wanted to clear up that my reference to student loans was not meant to
start a discussion of the granting of _those_ loans.  It was meant to spark
a discussion of the lending to those borrowers *after* they graduate.  As a
group, their default rate is generally high.  And yet, as a group, the
extension of credit to these people is not systematically denied (as in
redlining).

I take responsibility for the thread being confused as I believe my first
mention of it was unclear.  mea culpa.
