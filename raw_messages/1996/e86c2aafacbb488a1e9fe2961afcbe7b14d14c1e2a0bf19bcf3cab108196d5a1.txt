Hello? We're talking packets, not sessions. Trying to do this at the
network layer (or lower) is so monstrously wrong that it's not worth
talking about. It's impossible by design. In a properly designed system,
the application should have no way to tell the protocol stack to flip
special bits. What about encapsulation? Fragmentation? LAN emulation?

Although... if you're talking ATM PVCs rather than packets, I could
imagine adding minor/adult negotiation to the setup phase. But despite the
hype, I don't expect to see many people using raw ATM (not LAN
emulation/encapsulation) for a decade, if at all.

We're talking packets here, not sessions.

For this you use different TCP ports and out-of-band cryptographic
authentication, not extra fields in the packets.
