	Actually, SafeSurf (of CyberAngels association - an indicator of
problems right then and there) is doing so also.

	I think they want the ability to track who's putting their ratings into
their web pages. They don't check very well, though; when I wanted to see what
the questionarre was like, I simply put in a fake email address (which could
have been a nym's address), a fake web page, and a pseudonym. Their user
agreement asks you to achnowledge a license giving them the right to examine
any web page to which you attach a rating; however, I don't see anything
preventing someone from simply duplicating it without going through the
system.

	As I've stated above, they claim that they will check to see. The
SafeSurf page, as well as recruiting the CyberAngels to check, also claims that
	A. The "Internet community" will punish someone for fake ratings
	B. Anyone putting a too-low rating on a page with sexual content will
		be prosecuted (apparantly for "contributing to the delinquency
		of a minor" or some such nonsense)

	No, it isn't. For a market-driven system to emerge, we're going to
have to have one or both of two things:
	A. Raters being paid by the people who post web pages. Not likely.
	B. Raters being paid by the people who get the ratings. More likely.
Neither the RSAC or SafeSurf systems does either of these.
