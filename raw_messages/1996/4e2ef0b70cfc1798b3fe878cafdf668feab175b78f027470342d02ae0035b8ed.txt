This is not at all clear.  Infact, there is good evidence it goes the other 
way.

Mr. Bell, again, needs to learn law.
Seems even Nazis know it better than he.

Considering by this time the encryped data would have been seized as 
evidence, I doubt this makes much difference.
Hey, call me a Nazi.

The data holder is ordered to turn over the data.  He does in this 
scenerio, the data is encrypted, LEO goes to the principal, principal 
refuses to provide key for the encrypted key that the escrow agent was 
holding, compelled discovery is ordered, now your right back into the 
case where the principal never gave the data to the escrow agent in the 
first place.

In short, useless expense.
Very un-Nazi like.  Which is, of course, why I oppose it.

Ah yes, the final resort.  Grab the pitchforks and torches!
And he calls me a Nazi.
