No (sigh) I'm not a believer in the tooth fairy, nor a kid.  I take the time
and trouble to post to the list something of bona-fide value and interest
and all you can do is snipe at some side-comment, tongue-in-cheek at that?
I see we're not talkin' bout a 1-percenter here, are we?   Let's see if you
can't do something more useful next time.
