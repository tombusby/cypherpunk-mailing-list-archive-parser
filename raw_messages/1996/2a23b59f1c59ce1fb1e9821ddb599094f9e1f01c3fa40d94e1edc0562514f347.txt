What with the concern of hacked or modified clients, I would think that
trusting a java applet someone put on their page would be rather difficult.
How could the user know that you weren't really sending their cleartext back

I have not seen a mixmaster client for the PC/Win95 yet.  Did I just miss it?

Remember that we can't really know if their applet is secure or just a
trojan horse.
