A good point, however, people do get the strange idea that killing someone
in war is not murder.  They also get the idea that when the govt. executes
someone, that that is also not murder.  I know that that is a personal
opinion, but I know also that I am not alone in my belief and to overcome
the number of people who agree with me to make a system such as Mr. Bells'
feasable would not be possible (I hope!)  If such system did succeed, the
citizens who spoke out against it on an ethical basis would find themselves
targets!  I do hope that those who do agree with the death penalty are not
so callous that they would execute their fellow citizens for disagreeing
with them.  We are, after all, fellow citizens of this country.  We would
be right back to where we started, an Orwellian society living in the face
of fear for what we believe, and that is *not* freedom.
