Ironically, CoS was trying to determine my name, from Keith.

If I'm subpoenaed, I think I'll tell them to fuck off. I'm not a party to
the CoS business in any way, save for whatever influence I may have had
when the first remailers were implemented several years ago   (by others,
not me) and whatever ideas I may have discussed here on this list.

I'm not a defender of CoS, let's make this clear. I knew they were flakes
since I first heard of them back around 1967, before most of you were even
born.

But there is an ongoing, vitriolic battle between the CoS and its critics,
and the remailers are one of the main "weapons" being used.

I take no sides whatsoever, merely noting that it is, in Bill Stewart's
words, "unsurprising" that CoS lawyers are taking the steps they are
taking.
