We did Fourier transforms in third--or-fourth semester calculus in college,
but then I _was_ an engineer; electrical engineers would go on to do
lots more of this stuff, since frequencies and waveforms are their territory.
Essentially, you can look at "most" continuous functions in normal time-space,
or you can represent them in a frequency space instead,
and you can reproduce the original function by transforming from
the frequency space back to the time space.  The "Lebesgue" bit
is a precise definition of "most".  

(For most of the math I did in college, "Lebesgue" was a phrase meaning 
"/* you are not expected to understand this */",
and it and Measure Theory got trotted out to clarify rigorously
when functions are well-behaved enough for the stuff we were learning to apply.
Most functions you use are Lebegue integrable, unless you use stuff like
"f(x) = 0 if x is rational and 1 if x is irrational".)

Discrete Fourier Transforms are a related analysis technique that work
on sets of numbers such as equally-spaced samples from a continuous function.
The Fast Fourier Transform is a particularly efficient way to do DFTs,
which was a breakthrough that made them practical to do on computers,
and Jim was reminding the previous poster that for the problem at hand,
determining the frequency spectrum of whatever-it-was, that DFTs aren't
what you need; you need the regular continuous Fourier transform.
