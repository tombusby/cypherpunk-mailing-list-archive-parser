I agree with Norm's points.

This statement was not as clear as I wish I had been.  The trap door in RSA
key generation is sufficient to require careful examination of the source
for any RSA key (unless you can take the out Norm suggests as):

When I started discussing using only 32 bits of the random number, I was
thinking of random session keys such as PGP generates for its IDEA cypher. 
I agree you could detect a small number bits being used to generate these
keys by a birthday attack.  However, most systems make sure these keys are
never revealed outside the system (to preserve the secrecy of the
messages).  It is not easy to do a birthday audit of e.g. PGP session keys.
