I've known for a while that I have no rights as a minor. [ironic smilie]

You suggest that we minors stand up for ourselves? How odd. I'm sure no one
has ever thought of that before, President Clinton especially. Since any
nationally imposed curfew wouldn't have a leg to stand on in the first place,
this can only improve the situation.

This sounds interesting. What are the particulars of being an emancipated minor?

I wish I were so lucky. At 15 I seem to pass for ... 12. I guess if the cops
read from right to left ...
