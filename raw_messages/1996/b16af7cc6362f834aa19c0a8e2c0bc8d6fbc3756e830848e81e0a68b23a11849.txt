Since the TCP and IP layers are not the same, this won't happen. The
retransmit occurs at the TCP layer and the IP layer will re-encrypt
with a new initialization vector.

Also true. Plus there are IPSEC transforms being talked about that
will put in replay elimination, so I doubt this is going to be a
problem.

On the other hand, you can detect TCP packets pretty easily by timing
them. They will usually follow a nice Van J. algorithm profile.
