Hi!

I'm working on a cipher that utilizes Cipher Block Chaining
and One-way hashing to create a sequence of pseudo-random
numbers to XOR against a plaintext.

I'd like to know if anyone has comments regarding the hash
method I came up with. It is a combination of Transposition
and XORing. Basically, it works like this:

Let's say K is the 8 character key that will be hashed. 
There are two binary accumulators M and L, which store the
Most and Least significant bits in each byte of K. After M and
L are both 8 bits long, they are XORed together and the 
resulting value replaces byte N in the Key. This is repeated
8 times, and each time, N is incremented by one.

	Any thoughts, comments?
