The maximum entropy after one riffle shuffle is actually about
48 bits, assuming the deck was split in half.  That is, n! / k! (n-k)! =
52! / 2 * 26! ~= 4.9592 * 10^14.  log_2 4.9592 * 10^14 = 48 bits.
(Think of one half of the deck of k cards fitting into n possible
holes.  The order of each half of the deck is guaranteed, so this
can be thought of as the number of ways k balls fit into n holes.
What about the other half of the deck?  They just fall into the
empty holes.)

Assume the split introduces about 4 more bits, and we get 52 bits
of possible shuffles.  However, in practice a riffle shuffle may be
more predictable.

It is possible that 32 bits of entropy are introduced with each riffle
shuffle, but it is not obviously true.  For a cryptographic application,
the standard is higher than for almost any other.  So, if it is not
clear that something is the case, probably it shouldn't be used.

That's true, but the application of mathematics certainly does
depend on empirical evidence.  I would be very surprised if Diaconis
made a mistake with the math.  I think the math is what primarily
interests him.  From his book I did not see a lot of evidence that
a great deal of empirical research on card shuffling had been performed.
Rather, a few mathematicians here and there appear to have tried out
the model and decided that it more or less works.  For the standards
we should apply, those of a cryptographic application, this is not
good enough.

I solved this problem in my original message on the subject.  You use
the order of the cards to represent your message.  Then you use a
fully shuffled deck to mix up the mapping of the cards to numbers.  If
the deck is truly randomly ordered, the scheme I proposed is a true
one time pad.  (If I made an error, I would like to hear about it!)

Tangentially, I would be reluctant to rely on a one time pad whose
key was produced by a hash function.  We assume that the hash function
is cryptographically secure, but if we can assume that, we might as
well assume that some cryptosystem is secure.  One time pads are supposed
to avoid those types of assumptions.

I agree completely.  In practice, you pretty much have to have a
computer to make use of the original schemes I proposed.

The literature on card shuffling is quite interesting.  A number of people
over many years have worked on this.  It looks to me like there's lots
more interesting work to be done.  Many readers of this list would
probably find Diaconis's book interesting.

There might even be a number of new attacks possible on card games.
If 7 riffle shuffles does not, in fact, bring the deck to complete
entropy it means that a number of combinations of cards are unlikely.
Is the distribution of pokers hands perfectly even?  They may not
be.  Solving this problem in the general case appears to be very
hard.  But, some progress could be made by modeling real shuffling
and looking for patterns in the relationships between the cards
electronically.  Conceivably, poker hands are not as random as people
believe.  While the cards you have in your hand may be random, their
relationship to other cards may not.

This is like a pseudo random number generator.  If you don't notice
the pattern, you will believe you are looking at a random number
stream, but in fact you are not.

However, the entire subject is orthogonal to my goals right now.
