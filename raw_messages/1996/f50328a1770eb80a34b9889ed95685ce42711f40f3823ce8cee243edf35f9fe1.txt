I haven't followed this thread since the initial posting of
the Declaration, but this particular piece of shallow thinking
jumped out of the computer at me.

On sum, the people on the Net are the brightest, most 
sophisticated segment of our society.  Politicians, by 
contrast, are--on sum--the most venal of humans.  To liken
them to "parents" and the rest of us to teenage ingrates is
truly insulting.  An apology is in order from Mr. Cook.

Even assuming agruendo that the analogy applies, then the 
Declaration is still on the right track.  It's time to grow
up, leave our parents' house and move beyond their smothering
"care."  Grow up Tim Cook.  You've parked your feet under Mom
and Dad's table too long.  It's time to deal with your peers
and the rest of the world on your own, two, independent feet.
