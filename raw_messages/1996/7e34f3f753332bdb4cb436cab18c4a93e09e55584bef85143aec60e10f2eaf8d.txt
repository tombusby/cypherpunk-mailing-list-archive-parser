I have apparently been excrutiatingly unclear in my last post (tired folks
should stay away from their terminals).  I wasnt refrencing governmental
action, but rather a flaw in some principles.  I believe that the line of
thought that we should all speak "proper" english leads to anti-libertarian
results.  What has been missing from my posts is the link to the chain of
english-as-an-official-language regulation.  

Tim's argument for the ability to communicate is somewhat reasonable in an
employment context (although it depends largely upon the employment).  When
it is couched in the terms of his post, it makes the link to the chain of
reasoning above much easier to make.
