Having met Colby and being somewhat familiar with his political skills I
would be surprised if he would ever think a drowning accident was
"non-suspicious."

William Colby, whatever anyone may think of intelligence, was quite a man,
respected in the community, a major in the OSS and a World War II hero
decorated 5 times.  His like are not common.

I hope he is found alive and well.
