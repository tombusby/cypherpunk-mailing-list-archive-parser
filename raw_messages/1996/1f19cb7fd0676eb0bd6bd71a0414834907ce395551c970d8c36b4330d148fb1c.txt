We're not reading from the same page. This discussion is about information
warfare and the robustness of US financial, information, control, and power
infrastructures, not ITAR. Could you be kind enough to check the Subject,
read Gorelick's testimony, and perhaps even (dare I suggest it) read the
discussion prior to your post?

Again you are off-topic and non-responsive.

Again you are off-topic and non-responsive.

Again you are off-topic. We're talking about information warfare threats of
the sort that bring entire systems and infrastructures crashing down.

But thanks for responding. I share your concerns. I feel your pain. Vote
for me in '93. :-)
