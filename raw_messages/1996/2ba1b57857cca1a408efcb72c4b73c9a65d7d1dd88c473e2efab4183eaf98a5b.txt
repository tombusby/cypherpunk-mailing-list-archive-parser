The copyright issue is probably irrelevant to the Scientology dispute, 
anyway.  The material on which the copyright is claimed almost certainly 
wasn't marked, appropriately, as it would have had to be for the copyright 
to be valid.  While current law no longer requires the "circle-C" notation 
long used for this purpose, the material involved is far more than old 
enough to have been subject to this requirement, and once a copyright is 
lost (or not claimed) I believe it couldn't be regained.

The threat to remailers is one of the many reasons the Leahy bill sucked, 
and that would have made it worse by imposing criminal sanctions on this 
kind of thing.  Ironically, with the way remailers are used, it would 
actually have been possible for some copyright holder to fabricate a 
violation of copyright law by posting his own material through remailers, 
and then sue the final remailer, or have its owner prosecuted.

I'm glad the people around here finally saw the light.
