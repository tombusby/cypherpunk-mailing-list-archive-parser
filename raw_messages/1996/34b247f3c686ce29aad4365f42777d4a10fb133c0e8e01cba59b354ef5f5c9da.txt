Once your secret key has been compromised, then all that prevents a Bad Guy
from reading your message is your secret key passphrase. (I believe that,
aside from grabbing keystrokes a la TEMPEST, the only way to get this passphrase
is by brute-forcing it, or maybe searching your house for the little piece
of paper that you may have written it on.) I have seen equations which claim
to compute the security of your passphrase and also passphrase generators - 
I don't know if either are any good, though.
