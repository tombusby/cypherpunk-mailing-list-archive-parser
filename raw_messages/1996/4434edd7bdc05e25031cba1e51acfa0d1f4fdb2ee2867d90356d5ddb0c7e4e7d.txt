Agreed, any more than is Willie's subsidizing illegitimacy, despite his oft-
proven love for sex-without-responsibility.

This is so moronic it could only come from Hallam. For you, "deregulation"
means doubling the government's liability, as happened when that space-
cadet (really!) Garn and that crook Fernand St. Germain raised the payout
from 50 to 100 thousand. Yeah, Phill, that really deregulated 'em...

Certainly not for that crook Cranston, either. There's a reason 4 of the
Keating 5 were Democrats, Phill. They were and are even more for sale than
the Republicans. Political history, even recent, isn't your strong suit,
and your pity for taxpayers is touching, if a bit recent.
