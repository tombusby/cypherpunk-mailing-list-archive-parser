Yes PERRYMOOSE (tm), this IS crypto related.

The Hypothesis:

Now....there oughta be a way to generate random numbers
using the signal to noise ratio of just this very list!

No, I'm not good at this sort of thing (we all know that)
but it is there as a random variable, within a random variable.

It's better than a clock for everyone gets messages differently.

But you can change the s/n ratio and durations of s/n to generate
the numbers on, so that it'd be pretty secure.

Something to think about :)

Love Always,
