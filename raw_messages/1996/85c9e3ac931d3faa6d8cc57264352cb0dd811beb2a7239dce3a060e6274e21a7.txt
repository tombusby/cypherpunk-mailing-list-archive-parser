What's the old saying, "Those of you who think you know everything are very 
irritating to those of us who do."

First off, serial binary formats for transmitted data are at least as old as 
the 1930's, and the term "byte" was coined in the early-middle 70's, as I 
recall.  Therefore it is highly unlikely (and, in fact, wrong) that the term 
"byte" referred specifically to serial binary streams.  

In fact, the term "character" is the word used to describe a serial data 
object composed of bits.  The length of that character can vary:  As any ham 
knows (or ought to know!) many early teleprinters used a so-called 5-level 
(5 bits per character; there were shift characters inserted to multiply the 
available codes) code called Baudot, while more recent ones used the 
now-common, 7-bit ASCII code.  A typical ASCII asynchronous character is 
transmitted using a start bit, seven or eight data bits, an optional parity 
bit, and one or more stop bits (usually 1, today, but it can be 1.5 or 2.)
