hrmm.. While what you say is SOMETIMES true, it usually is not.  For
instance, my older brother and I took American History in school the same
year.  I took it at a school for people with learning disabilites, he took
it in a perfectly normal public school.  EVERYBODY in my class had ADHD.
EVERYBODY.  He was the only person in his class who was afflicted with
this.  His teacher noted that he was one of the least trouble making
students.  My class got through the material, his class did not. 

See my point?

BTW, in case it makes any difference, he was on ritalin (spelling? I
dunno, neither of us can spell ;) at the time, and I was not, although
most of the people in my class were.

Hrmmm... doubtful... I've actually never had a cavaty... maybe the
