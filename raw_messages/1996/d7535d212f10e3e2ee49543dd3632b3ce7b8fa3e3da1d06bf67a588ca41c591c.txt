you loose any cool stuff that cool sites give you. we are using them
(along with searchArgs) for a client to allow a "buddie" to follow
you around the site....when you come back, the buddy tells you how long
you have been gone, etc...a really cool fun harmless application of
cookies that makes the user experience much more fun and personal...

if you don't keep the format, navigator will probably remove that line
when it starts up.

if you keep the format, and have edited the cookie, the site on the
other end might not know what to do with the cookie when it gets it
again...(depends on how good the error checking, etc is...)

either way, contrary to popular belief, cookies really aren't a
security risk because they don't contain any information that you
don't already know. if a site gives you a cookie with your password in
it ( especially in clear text ), then they (the cgi programmers) are
idiots and should be shot on the spot.
