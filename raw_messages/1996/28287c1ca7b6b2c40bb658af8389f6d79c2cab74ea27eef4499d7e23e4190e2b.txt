Your best shot would be to make sure the part about the system being
voluntary was hard-wired into any legislation or rule-making. Unless and
until ITAR is modified by Congress, the USG has what Mark Twain called "the
calm confidence of a Christian with four aces" on this matter. That
is--unless and until Congress acts, the Administration has absolute
discretion with respect to the conditions under which they will liberalize
the administration of ITAR.
