	I have no problems with extending US sovereignty where it will improve
civil liberties. However, about the only place where it appears to do so is
going against child labor. Otherwise, every action of the US government in
this regard appears to have been to decrease civil liberties in other countries
(and, indirectly, in the United States).

	Well, I wouldn't say that the self-determination of nation states
is the important part. Indeed, most of the cases in which "national
sovereignty" is used as an excuse are ones in which the other country is in
the wrong. German censorship and Tianenmin (sp?) Square are excellent examples.
If patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel, national sovereignty is the
last refuge of a scoundrel nation.
	I've deleted the rest of your statements because I essentially
agree with them.
