	Speaking of Net-in-Orbit (while distributed datahavens have their
points, sometimes you'd prefer not to have a given chunk of data on your
hard drive - even encrypted with a passphrase), what's the physical setup
for rewriteable optical drives? Are there any methods of doing those that
will work OK in orbit?
