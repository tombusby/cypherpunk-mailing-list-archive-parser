However, I assume that you have no objection to others reviewing Don't
proposal for free (Actually for reputation).

Good interfaces are definitely something needed for the widespread adoption
of crypto, either strong or weak.  However, the general opinion I have
heard is that UIs with easily replaced crypto are covered by ITAR.


>Don is doing a Good Thing and the "cypher punks" are doing an evil thing.

If Don is contributing to better interfaces, then I agree he is doing a
good thing.  If all he is doing is proposing a new algorithm and describing
it with, to be charitable, non-standard uses of well defined terms, then I
disagree.

I strongly disagree that cypherpunks are doing an evil thing by exposing
the weaknesses in anyone's (including Don's) crypto system.  There are many
ways to contribute, and publicizing the facts about a system are one of
them.
