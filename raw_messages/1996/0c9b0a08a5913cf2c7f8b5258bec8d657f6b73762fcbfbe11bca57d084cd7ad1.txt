I've gotten several pieces of email from people who are getting two 
copies of stuff I post, but I've looked at my mailer (sendmail 8.6.10) 
and it's not sending out dups to toad.com, as far as I can tell.

If people continue to get dups from just me, then I'll have to install a 
sendmail front-end to log outgoing email or something...
