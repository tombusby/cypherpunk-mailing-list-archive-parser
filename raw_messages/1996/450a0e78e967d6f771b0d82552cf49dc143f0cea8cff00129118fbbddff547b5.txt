Well, attacks on military targets are almost, by definition, not
"terrorism." (I'll spare the list a debate about the semantics; U.S.
journalists tend to refer to anything done to "us" as "terrorism," whether
the target is military or civilian.)

The focus of my comments was really on civilian or non-military targets.
(Including destruction of government buildings, maybe. I'm not sure whether
the Oklahoma City bombing and the recent Phoenix/Viper Militia case is
"terrorism" in a formal sense, or counter-government action, but my point
is that such things are likely to be happen.)

Sure, any particular "soft target" can be hardened to some extent. But not
all of them, and even harder sites can be reached. This is left as an
exercise for the reader.

(Hint: The Japanese cult's Sarin gas attack on the subways...there are tens
of thousands of comparable targets in the U.S. alone. Look around, and ask
what it would take to harden each one. A minor cryptographic connection is
that hardening N of M sites makes the remaining M - N sites all the more
tempting.)

You are essentially making my point, that the biggest danger of the current
responses to terrorism is that nations will turn to national terrorism and
police state tactics.

No, wouldn't work. As with the "War on (Some) Drugs," all this does is
raise the price a bit, actually making it a more tempting market for many
to get into.

(And various CBW agents are incredibly cheap to make, with the precursors
available in common products. How ya gonna buy up all the peach pits, for
example? Or "buy up" all the fertilizer and fuel oil?)
