In other words, it's a fact of 5+ cheaper than I thought...

Well, I think I blew a decimal point, there.  Even so, semi-leading edge 
systems do about twice as well...

However, the errors partially cancel, so I'm actually off by a factor of 2.

In which direction? 

BTW, keep in mind I'm considering long-haul LD links between cities and 
states, NOT the kind of trenching that requires digging up city streets most 
of the way.  I don't doubt that some portions of a coast-to-coast link are 
substantially more expensive than $100 per meter, but as a proportion of the 
total length they are very small.

Which is why you're unwilling to call it a "subsidy."

You're full of inconsistencies.  First, you stated that the local/LD 
subsidies "went away with the breakup" (paraphrased) yet NOW you're saying 
"RBOC's currently charge what regulations allow."    I suggest that if those 
regulations "allow" RBOC's to charge 3 cents per minute to LD companies, 
_that_is_the_subsidy_ that you claimed had "gone away."  It's obvious that 
you don't want to use the dirty word "subsidy," but that's exactly what this 
thing is!

You need to remember that unless a price is defined by negotiation in the 
free market, there remains a possibility that it contains an underlying 
subsidy.  Since the whole purpose of the the payment from the LD company to 
the local co was as a subsidy, unless that payment disappears there is 
always a question of whether the subsidy remains.  Apparently it does.

The most obvious alternative, one that doesn't contain an obvious subsidy is 
a "per line per month" pricing system, where the number of lines counted is 
the maximum number of simultaneous calls that can be made through a given LD 
company at one time.  (NOT the total number of customers that the LD company 
has.)

It's because the locals don't NEED a subsidy.
