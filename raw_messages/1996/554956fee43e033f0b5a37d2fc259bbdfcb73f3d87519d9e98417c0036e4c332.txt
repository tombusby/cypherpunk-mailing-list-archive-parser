I have really scrambled up the quotes from verious people.  My appologies

One of NSA's traditional roles is to automatically scan communications and
pull out the "interesting" stuff.  To continue this role, they have to be
able to decrypt the messages.  I wouldn't, particularly when thinking in
paranoid mode, assume they have given up on that role.

I was assuming program only once chips, like the old burn-the-fuse PROMs. 
If you are ordering in quantity 700,000, for the RC4-40 engine, then you
have no need to worry about the cost of small runs of Mask programmed
chips.

If they are using Programmable-only-once Gate Arrays or Mask programmed
ones, $700 million for a machine which will cost $7 million for a simple
reprogramming might give them pause.  Or at least make them consider if
there is an alternative.  If they are using easily reprogrammable arrays,
then they have a general purpose computer specialized for certain types of
parallel processing.  If this machine cost $100 million, I agree they would
probably build it.

I feel like I'm leaning over backwards to defend NSA's response, an
extremely uncomfortable position (and I could crack my skull when I fall)
:-).  The most important issue is, what is NSA's state of the art.  If we
accept their $1000/FPGA chip, then they are indeed at the bleeding edge,
and suffering from the associated low chip yields.  If they are at the best
cost-performance point for 2-3 years ago or whenever they started approving
the export of RC4-40, then they are certainly subject to David Wagner's
performance limits.

A number of people have mentioned the heat problems.  I, and I think also
NSA, never said they couldn't be solved, but solving them involves
engineering costs, whether it is to design cooling or distribution
techniques.  I think the bullets in their response were primarily to
justify that $10 million NRE cost.  (Getting to $10 million isn't hard on a
government project.)

Given this kind of hardware, the only reasonable assumption is that if NSA
hasn't built a general purpose cracking engine, they will.

The idea of a genetic system to "learn" an unknown cypher system and then
brute force crack it is indeed worth a paper, perhaps several.
