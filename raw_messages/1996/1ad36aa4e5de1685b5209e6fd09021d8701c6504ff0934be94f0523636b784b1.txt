Timothy C. May writes in answer to jim bell -

|Screaming insults at people, resorting to ad hominem attacks on their
|personality (such as Jim did with Padgett Peterson), ranting about how
|people are fools and worse, and generally foaming at the mouth...these are
|behaviors which cause people to be dismissed as jerks, paranoids, and
|killfile occuppants.

|I have nothing against you, Jim Bell, but you are coming across as a loon,
|as someone who clearly needs some kind of anti-psychotic medication.
This is not supposed to be an insult??

|You rant, you quote excessively, you dissect short comments with 
|pages-long diatribes
Says the one complaining of jim making ad hominem attacks.
