  Dave, 
 
 
  The following may be of some help: 
 
    DigiCash bv was founded by Dr. David Chaum, a digital cash 
    and electronic security expert.  DigiCash announced the first 
    software-only product, called Ecash, that allows the transfer 
    of digital cash over the Internet.  CURRENTLY, DigiCash tech- 
    nology is being used in electronic wallets and smart cards; 
    but IN THE LONG-TERM, the technology will be used for MANY 
    MORE applications.
