It looks like this judge is well on her way to throwing out the 
portion of ITAR which deals with software of all kinds, not merely digitized 
source code originally from books.  That's progress, of a sort.

I'm still waiting to see what that "Burns bill" will be all about.  Since 
that bill is supposed to deal directly with the issues this judge has 
already shown sense on, I think that this bill ought to be no less generous 
with computer software exports than an anticipated court decision WRT ITAR 
will be.
