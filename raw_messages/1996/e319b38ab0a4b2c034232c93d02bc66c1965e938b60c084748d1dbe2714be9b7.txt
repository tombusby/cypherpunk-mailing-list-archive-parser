Dunno, But you might get a kick out this from The Chicago Reader that 
published a list of the "bomb threats" made at O'Hare International 
airport a few weeks back.
  
7/18:  "I have nothing other than the bomb I am going to put on the plane."
7/18:  "I have a bomb that's going to go off in 30 seconds."
7/18:  "You mean the bomb I have in my bag?"
7/19:  "I don't have an ID, but I have a bomb."
7/21:  "There's a bomb in the bag in my hand."
7/23:  "I don't have a bomb in the bag."
7/23:  "I got a bomb in my bag to kill everyone here."
7/24:  "Well no, I left my pipe bomb at home."
7/25:  "The one that looks like [there's] a bomb in it."
7/26:  "I have a bomb in my bag.  Boom."
7/27:  "Where should I put the bomb?"
7/27:  "No, nothing but a bomb."
7/31:  "Are you checking for bombs?  I've got a bomb in my bag."
7/31:  "I have some explosives to transport."
8/1:  "It's not as if we were Swedish and here to blow up the airport."
8/2:  Offender:  "It's a bomb in the bag."  Witness:  "That's not funny."
Offender:  "I'm not playing."
8/3  "I have a bomb."
