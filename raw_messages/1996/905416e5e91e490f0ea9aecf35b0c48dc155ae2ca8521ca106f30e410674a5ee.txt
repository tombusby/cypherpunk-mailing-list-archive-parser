Jesus Christ, Chuq, are you incompetent at *everything* you set your
hand to?  Your plaidworks.com ListAdmin Web page 
(http://www.plaidworks.com/ListAdmin/) is an open invitation to troublemakers
to mailbomb.

Gee, maybe I should root around plaidworks and see if I can find other
security holes.  Wouldn't it be fun if I could find a way to stuff the
Nebula ballot box . . . ? ;-)

If you wish to respond to this, please do it from another site than
plaidworks.com, as I am immediately telling procmail to bounce all mail
originating from that site:
