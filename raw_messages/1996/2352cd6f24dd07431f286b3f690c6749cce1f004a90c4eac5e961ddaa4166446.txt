SPA Files Copyright Suits Against ISPs and End Users

Internet Anti-Piracy Campaign Launched

(Oct.10, 1996 --Washington, D.C.) -- The Software Publishers Association
(SPA) announced today that it has filed five civil lawsuits for copyright
infringement occurring on the Internet. Three of the lawsuits were filed
against Internet service providers (ISPs), and the remaining two were filed
against individual end users. Additionally, SPA launched its Internet
Anti-Piracy Campaign, which includes education and enforcement components,
in an effort to educate and work cooperatively with ISPs regarding
copyright infringement.

ISP lawsuits were filed on Oct. 7 and 8 against Community ConneXion of
................................................^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Oakland, Calif.; GeoCities of Beverly Hills, Calif.; and Tripod Inc. of
Williamstown, Mass. The SPA members named as plaintiffs in all three suits
were Adobe Systems Inc., Claris Corp. and Traveling Software Inc. In each
case, SPA first contacted the ISP and requested that the infringing
material be removed, but the ISP failed to respond and cooperate.
