Hi! this is the second time I post this to CP.

Where can I get Secure Split?
Apparently, it is a program to split a key in m parts, where 
n (<m) parts could rebuild the key.

I saw that name in Nautilus manual (a pgpphone lookalike for dos).

I looked through Alta Vista and the only thing I found was a post on CP
by somebody else looking for it, in 1994 (?)
Does such a program exists?
If yes, where can I get it?

Regards
