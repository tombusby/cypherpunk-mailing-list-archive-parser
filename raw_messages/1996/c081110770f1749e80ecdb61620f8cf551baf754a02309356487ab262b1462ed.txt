Think it through. 

1 Alice generates session key K
2 encrypts with Bob's public key, producing Epb(K)
3 extracts 24 bits of K to make K'
4 encrypts with Eve's (spy) public key, producing Epe(K')

5 encrypts message under K, producing EsK(M)

6 sends EsK(M), Epb(K), Epge(K') to recipient (and possibliy Eve)

7 Bob's copy of lotus decrypts Epb(K), recovering K

8 Bob's copy of lotus repeats steps 4 & 5 above, and checks if
   it's version of Epe(K') matches the one sent. 

9 If it does,  decrypt EsK(M), and give it to Bob
   If it does not,  send a copy to the NSA, blowing the whistle on 
   Alice, who's running a hacked copy. 

Thus, you can prevent a non-complying copy  of Lotus from talking to 
a complying copy of Lotus, which is one of the goals of the GAKers.

Granted, but we don't know if they use RC4, DES, or what.
