Subject: PICS is not censorship

I do not believe that PICS is a form of censorship, except for those 
people - children and employees - whose computing environment is 
beyone their direct control and who have to live with a browser that 
filters based on PICS labels.

For much, much more on the Internet content regulation debate, see my 
WWW site.

PICS is basically an excellent idea in my view.  It provides a means 
of child protection which is not censorship of the net or censorship 
of sources of information.  It is also useful for other things.  

However I don't beleive it is practical or desirable to insist that
all people use PICS and a particular value system to label their WWW
material - there is likely to be no suitable value system which is
adequate in all situations.
