Hmmmm... I am at a loss as why the customers identity needs to be know at all?

What does it matter if I am a new customer or not?

I don't see why we couldn't have anonymous prepaid credit-cards similiar to the prepaid calling cards available now. You pop down to the local bank here's $500 cash, they give you your card, when you have used up your $500 you throw it away. Of cource the issuer of the card would charge some fee for the service, say $1 on every $100, maybe more maybe less the market will decide that. :)  

No one need know who I am or what I am purchasing. Much simpler to implement, no id verification, no blinded credentials, Just treat it like any other credit card.
