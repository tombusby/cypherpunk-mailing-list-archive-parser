I am not certain about 2.x, but the 1.x would read mail through an NNTP
proxy, but not post it.  SOCKS would work, but not for the type of
connection the poster was looking for...  In 1.2 and 1.22, the NNTP proxy
was hidden in the netscape.ini file.  (It was considered "broken" becuase
you could not post to news.)

No good answers...
