Update:  cypherpunks-d, bsdi-users(-d), unix-lizards.

The system running the mailing lists has now been physically moved from
one place to another (phew, didn't drop it!), and all seems to be OK.  A
couple of DNS changes still remain to be made, but things seem to be
working pretty well. 

I will be moving a couple of things around and updating some systems OS 
soon, so we're not all done yet... 

Please let me know if you see any additional oddities.  

Just for the record: ISDN really IS cool.  I just can't wait to get that 
other B channel running.. yowza.. 128k to the house!
