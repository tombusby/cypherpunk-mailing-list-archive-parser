Tell ya what: name a weapon that CANNOT be used to harm an innocent

"Legal" is the word you're looking for, not legitimate.

What?!?  You mean that after 100 million war deaths in this century alone, 
you're suggesting that we DON'T have "free-for-all bloody violence"?  Or are 
you simply used to the kind of violence that exists today?  That's a common 
trap people fall into:  They simply accept whatever current system we have, 
as if it is somehow required or okay or...

Right!  There are no "laws" per se.  But there are people, and their 
interests, and what they believe to be their rights.

>do not rely on the judicial system to solve their problems.

RIGHT!  But as importantly, they aren't the _victims_ of that "judicial 
system" either.  Rodney King, for instance.  Donald Scott.  Randy Weaver.  
The Branch Davidians, etc.  All these people were fundamentally victims of 
an organization political/legal heirarchy filled with people who had 
(defacto) greater rights/authority than ordinary citizens, and abused the 
public with it.

I've explained that I believe that the post-AP world will be far less 
violent than today, partly because there will be no people in positions of 
authority who can abuse the rest of us with impunity, or force us to go to 
war against our will.  It will also allow GOOD people to punish BAD people 
without depending on the "system" to do it.  It will also tend to prevent 
the enforcement of "victimless crime" laws that currently result in 60-70% 
of the prison and jail population.

 You need to show that yes, you see the advantages, but also show that you 
have a plausible belief that my system will be worse than the status quo.  
Citing a specific potential problem without quantifying it is pointless.

Each individual, for himself.  True, he may occasionally make mistakes, but 
I contend that the vast majority of these decisions will be entirely 
justified.  The truly bad people, the REAL criminals, will not last long.

If the danger you describe was of higher probability than the alternative, 
the status quo, you might have a point.  But it isn't.  Further, the 
prospect of AP getting rid of (or reforming, because they'll have no choice) 
most of the real criminals (plus de-populating government and preventing its 
abusiveness) results in a dramatic reduction in the violations of rights 
that will occur.

Just because we currently think of "the government" as "the entity created 
to safeguard rights" doesn't mean that this is really so, and it doesn't 
mean that it actually achieves a net protection of our rights.  What 
government actually does is to monopolize (as best it can) the use of force, 
and then force the public to pay for a protection service.  And monopolies 
result in classicly bad service, as we all know.

If the probability of an improper action is dramatically reduced, without 
being eliminated, that is an improvement, right?  Tell me, as a citizen 
don't we deserve changing to a system that reduces violations of rights?

No, it doesn't, certainly not quantitatively, and in practice not 
qualitatively, either.  

Take a 5-foot wave, and notice that it doesn't overflow a 50-foot seawall.  
Twenty of them, separately, likewise don't get past it.  But combine them in 
one large wave, and the 100-foot wave does get by.  The fundamental 
advantage of AP is that the desires of thousands of people can be combined 
in order to accomplish what no individual would be able to induce on his own.
