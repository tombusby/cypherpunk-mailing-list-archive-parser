I think that is the main reason PGP is not more common place. If it was 
seamlessly integrated with Windows software such as mailers I am sure it 
would be used widely. It will be interesting to see if this develops.

I think it is actually easy to use, although granted others may not; but 
that people tend not to use it as a matter of course (and it is my belief 
this is a desireable thing) due too the time taken to manually sign mail 
or sign and encrypt. Lets face it the average user has trouble with a 
dos command prompt and until there is a point and click emailer easily 
available most people just won't try PGP for email. It would also raise 
the general awareness of PGP and encryption and privacy issues I hope as 
it is my experience that outside the dedicated and the interested, very 
few have even heard of PGP or realise that their email may be read easily 
by persons other than the intended recipient. If this should occurr the 
horse would have bolted as far as any attempts at government outlawing 
its use; by and large; or at the very least would make it impossible to 
pass laws banning PGP without the public at large realising that they 
might possibly be loosing something which at the moment I doubt many 
would having never used encryption for email.
