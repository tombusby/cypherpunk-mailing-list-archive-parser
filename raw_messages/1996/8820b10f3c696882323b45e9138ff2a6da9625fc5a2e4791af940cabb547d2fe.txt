You got to choose to do what is needed to live a better life.  And 
most of them ain't doing what it takes.

When I was a kid, everything that had characters printed on it was 
readable.  Who is *preventing* them from reading?

I think that it should not be subsidized.
If you feel like subsidising education, then by all means, do it.  
But why should you stick a gun in my back to do the same?  What if I 
do not want to do the same as you?

In *my* opinion, it is right on the money.  But if you can stand 
reality, then I understand why you rant...

BTW, I do not understand the "logics" that want to bring everybody 
down because some individuals are down.  This is a system that punish 
achievement for being achievement and value meekness for itself.
A total, anti-life aberration.
