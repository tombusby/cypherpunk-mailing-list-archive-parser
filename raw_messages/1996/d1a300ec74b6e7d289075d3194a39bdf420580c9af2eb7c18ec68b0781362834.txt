attila, if you wouldn't post propaganda from the Church, then I 
*might* agree with you.  But you can't do that and expect those of us 
who know better to keep quiet.

Love your CYA statement, dude.  It's terribly doubtful that Hinckley 
knows the details of Mountain Meadows, or that he would want to 
discuss them, if he did.

Very good.  You know, of course, that if you say the wrong thing in 
public, that your fate will be that of D. Michael Quinn, the 
excommunicated Mormon historian, who lost his Church membership 
because he would not stop telling unpleasant truths about the 
Church's early history.  Just so the other c-punks know that speaking 
truth has consequences.

If anyone wants a more jaundiced view of Utah, please drop me a line. 
I can be a Utah cheerleader if I want (there are many good things 
about living here) but the fact of the matter is that we live in a 
Church State.  I resent the fact that the dominant religion seems to 
want to tell *everyone* here how to live their lives.

I would suggest two books, both by historian Juanita Brooks:

"The Mountain Meadows Massacre"
"John D. Lee"

Before the days of Boyd K. Packer, historians weren't excommunicated. 
Mrs. Brooks' punishment for writing these two books was to be shunned 
in her southern Utah community.  But they remain *the* sources on 
Mountain Meadows and the general attitude of the people at the time.

I notice that attila didn't mention these sources.
