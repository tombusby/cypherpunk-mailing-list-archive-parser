First:  You will not get that, because governments invariably privilege large 
businesses above small businesses and individuals. and invariably privilege 
old established businesses against new businesses.

Secondly if you were able to get that, it would be even worse than the what 
you will actually get.

If you have one law for men who run businesses and one law other folks, 
then we have selective enforcement and application of the laws, 
that enables governments to act selectively and capriciously.   
For example here in California private citizens who attempt to organize 
recall elections are often subject to extraordinary and confiscatory fines.
