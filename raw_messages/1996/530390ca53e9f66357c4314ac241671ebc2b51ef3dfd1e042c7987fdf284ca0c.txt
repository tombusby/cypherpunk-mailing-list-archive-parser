>   BRUSSELS (Sep 29, 1996 00:12 a.m. EDT) - European Union
>   telecommunications ministers, reacting to a child-sex scandal in
>   Belgium, pledged Friday to consider ways to keep illegal material that
>   could harm children off the Internet.
   
>   Belgian Telecommunications Minister Elio Di Rupo announced that his

>   providers to monitor and report material featuring sexual abuse or
>   exploitation of children.
   
>   He asked his colleagues to join forces with him.

	Market? Wider distribution of such pictures will lead to _decreased_
production, for the simple reason that the producers won't be able to go to
courts for stopping copyright violations, so they can't make any money.
   
>   The ministers agreed to expand a working party that has already been
>   set up to look at the question of illegal material on the Internet and
>   asked it to come up with concrete proposals before they meet again in
>   November.
   
>   The group will include representatives of the 15 EU telecoms
>   ministries and of companies that provide access to online services or
>   prepare the content, a statement adopted by the ministers said.

>   But some of the telecoms ministers, including those from Britain and

>   focus on fighting truly illegal material.
   
>   British Science and Technology Minister Ian Taylor advocated a
>   self-regulatory system that was announced in his country earlier this
>   week.
   
>   Two British trade associations announced that an independent body, the
>   Safety Net Foundation, would be established to rate material carried
>   on the Internet and to set up a "hotline" service to receive
>   complaints about illegal material.
   
>   They said Internet service providers would also adopt policies for
>   removing illegal material and reducing the scope for subscribers to
>   act with untraceable anonymity.

	I suspect that any anonymous remailers operating in Britain may want
to look out for ISP interruptions...
