In the case of the C/A (civilian) code, absolutely.  In the case of the
P code (military) only if you have the key, but in that case, yes.

As Jim Bell pointed out, there are boxes you can buy for
suitable amounts of money that are "GPS simulators" -- they construct
out of whole cloth the signals you would receive if you were at
location X with satellites {Y1, Y2, ...} overhead.

However, if all you set out to do is fool a location authenticator,
deriving shifted location data from the actual satellites is far
easier and bound to be much cheaper.  There is one limitation
this has that the simulator approach doesn't -- delaying real signals
requires having access to the same satellites (or a large enough
subset, i.e., 3-4 of them) that the checking station has overhead.
