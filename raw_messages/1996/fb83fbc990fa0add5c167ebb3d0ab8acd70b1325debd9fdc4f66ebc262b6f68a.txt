That's assuming the phoneco cooperates.

Punknet is a 'Guerilla ISP'.  Twenty of us share a 128k ISDN line, 
distributed via high-speed modems.  It's been running fine for over
a year now, but Pacific Bell has evidently decided to get rid of us.

How?  Simply by refusing to either repair or replace our 25 pair trunk
line, which is rapidly degrading.  We've offered to replace it ourselves,
but according to them, it's illegal.  Right now, we've got three dead lines,
and two others that only will do 1200 baud.

We've been told that what they're doing is probably illegal, but it's the
old problem:  Where does an 800 lb. gorilla sleep?

We're fighting this like all hell, but who knows?  After they get rid of us,
I wonder who's next ...
