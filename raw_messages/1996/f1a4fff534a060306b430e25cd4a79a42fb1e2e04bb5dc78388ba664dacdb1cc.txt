At 8:30pm EST on Tuesday, August 13, 1996, the Republican National Convention
will be broadcast live over the Internet!  The Several members of Congress
will be present and, technology and Murphy's Law permitting, they'll be
able to talk to you online through CUSeeMe.

Many of New York's Republicans will be gathering at the @Cafe (address
below), one of New York's many fine cybercafes, to eat, drink, shmooze,
and queue up for a chance to talk to notable Republican legislators
live from the Republican convention.

Montana Senator Conrad Burns, who has been a driving force within the
bi-partisan push to deregulate encryption, will be cyber-present, as will
Montana Governor Marc Racicot, widely regarded as a visionary.

The event is being coordinated in San Diego by Mike Rawson of Senator
Conrad Burns office.  Rawson, who has been instrumental in putting the
Senate hearings live online along with Jonah Seiger of the Center for
Democracy and Technology, will be bringing Senators, and other luminaries
to the event.
