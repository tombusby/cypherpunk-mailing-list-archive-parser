Not all states (Washington and California, for example) will sell their DMV
lists.

There is a gentleman that goes by the handle of Bootleg, that does sell
CD-ROM versions of said listings (my guess where the Web site got the data
from).  Last heard, he had Oregon, Texas, and Florida.  Oregon was the
bargain around $220, Florida and Texas were about $500.

Try 503-325-0861 for voice (don't know if that's still current).  He may be
on the Net, but I don't have an address.
