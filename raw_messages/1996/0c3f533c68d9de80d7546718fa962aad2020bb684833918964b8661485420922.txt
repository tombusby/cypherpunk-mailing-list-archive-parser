Bell thought of the idea orig. as a broadcaster.  Then somehow when 
it was set up he or someone else in AT&T did that. If I recall (no 
refs handy) it had to do with the telegraph being (sort of) 
point-to-point...

Bell used to tour the vaudville circuit showing off the telephone. I 
think the idea emerged during that time... during such shows of tech 
(common at the time) there was a Q&A from the audience.
