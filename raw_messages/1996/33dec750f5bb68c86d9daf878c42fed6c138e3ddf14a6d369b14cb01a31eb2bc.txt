Hello Everyone,

	I have just updated the type2.list/pubring.mix combination on
jpunix.com. Of note, I have dropped ecafe-mix as it has not responded in a
LONG time and it doesn't look like it's going to get fixed any time soon.

	There are two new type II remailers on the list, Ad and lucifer.
Welcome aboard!

	The lists are available by WWW from www.jpunix.com and by
anonymous FTP fro ftp.jpunix.com.

	If you have any questions about the lists, please send email to
perry@alpha.jpunix.com.
