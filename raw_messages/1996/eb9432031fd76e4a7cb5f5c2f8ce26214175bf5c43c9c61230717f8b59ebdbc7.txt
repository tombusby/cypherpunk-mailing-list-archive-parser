No.  For example, the San Francisco Chronicle can be sold or given to minors
without restriction and yet it has published the word "fuck" on several
occasions.  This is considered "indecent" but not obscene.  Likewise other
newspapers, magazines, and books.  The Supremes have upheld time, place, and
manner restrictions on over-the-air broadcast of indecent material (The
Seven Words You Can't Say on Television), but these restrictions do not
apply to cable or even to broadcast later at night.

Obscene is different from indecent.  What Congress is attempting to do is
apply conventional broadcast TV and radio regulation to the Internet and
other computer networks in spite of the fact that they are not like those
systems and in any case those systems are supposed to be in the process of
being deregulated themselves.

But the protections are phony because ISPs have to bend over backwards to
block their systems from being used to transmit indecent material.  It just
deputizes them as cops.
