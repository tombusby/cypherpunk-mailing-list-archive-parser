Many.  You lack imagination.

Your conspiracy nut side is showing.

Colby was well known and friendly to his neighbors.  He was an
impressively outgoing person, a trait which showed both in his
unprecidented opening of the Agency (he was dismissed for cooperating too
completely with congress), and his personal life.  His neighbors in
Virginia were all close friends and the community there is very close
knit.  A pile of leaves in the wrong place attracts attention.

I used to run a private seminar in D.C.  The two times I asked, he was
happy to come and speak for us.  He was always amazingly frank and
engaging. Not at all a secretive man when it came to his personal beliefs
and activities.

Yes, they were.  He ran an active consulting business in D.C. and returned
to the city on a regular schedule.  In addition, he was very prudent about
letting people know when he was about to go out on the river.  The man was
in his 70s, of course he generated a good deal of concern amongst his
neighbors.

It's not hard to see.  As usual you are theorizing and speculating about
issues and persons you have no connection to.  Even in the face of someone
with personal experience as to the matter at hand you persist in asserting
that you are more 'in the know.'

In this particular case you are discussing someone I know personally.

Given the circumstances, your rumor mongering is both classless and
distasteful.
