-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

howdy folks,

the purpose of this message is to announce the addition of Type I
capabilities to the remailer at mix@zifi.genetics.utah.edu.
mix@zifi.genetics.utah.edu now supports the standard cpunk commands.

here's the section of the help file that pertains to the Type I
remailer, the whole help file available by sending a message to
mix@zifi.genetics.utah.edu with Subject: remailer-help.

the Type I remailer is Matt Ghio's code.  all commands are supported
EXCEPT usenet posting which would probably just get me in trouble.

the pgp key for the remailer is included in the message below.  in
addition, you can obtain the key by fingering
remailer@zifi.genetics.utah.edu. 

the whole help file is also available by fingering
mixmaster@zifi.genetics.utah.edu.

thanks,

		  Part II - Type I remailer features

I have an automated mail handling program installed here which will take
any message with the proper headers and automatically re-send it anonymously.
You can use this by sending a message to mix@zifi.genetics.utah.edu, with the
header Anon-To: containing the address that you want to send anonymously to.
(Only one recipient address is permitted.)  If you can't add headers to your
mail, you can place two colons on the first line of your message, followed
by the Anon-To line.  Follow that with a blank line, and then begin your
message.  For Example:

> From: joe@site.com
> To: mix@zifi.genetics.utah.edu
> Subject: Anonymous Mail
>
> ::
> Anon-To: beth@univ.edu
>
> This is some anonymous mail.

The above would be delivered to beth@univ.edu anonymously.  All headers in
the original message are removed, with the exception of the Subject (and
Content-Type, if present).  She would not know that it came from Joe, nor
would she be able to reply to the message.

However, if Beth suspected that Joe had sent the message, she could compare
the time that the message was received with the times that Joe was logged
in.  However, this problem can be avoided by instructing the remailer to
delay the message, by using the Latent-Time header:

> From: joe@site.com
> To: mix@zifi.genetics.utah.edu
> Subject: Anonymous Mail
>
> ::
> Anon-To: beth@univ.edu
> Latent-Time: +1:00
>
> This is some anonymous mail.

The above message would be delayed one hour from when it is sent.  It is also
possible to create a random delay by adding an r to the time (ie +1:00r),
which would have the message be delivered at a random time, but not more
than an hour.

Another problem is that some mailers automatically insert a signature file.
Of course, this usually contains the senders email address, and so would
reveal their identity.  The remailer software can be instructed to remove
a signature file with the header "Cutmarks".  Any line beginning with the
same text at in the cutmarks header, and any lines following it will be
removed.

> From: sender@origin.com
> To: mix@zifi.genetics.utah.edu
> Subject: Anonymous Mail
>
> ::
> Anon-To: recipient@destination.com
> Cutmarks: --
>
> This line of text will be in the anonymous message.
> --
> This line of text will not be in the anonymous message.

You can add additional headers to the output message by preceeding them
with ##

> From: chris@nifty.org
> To: mix@zifi.genetics.utah.edu
> Subject: Nifty Anon Msg
>
> ::
> Anon-To: andrew@hell.edu
>
> ##
> Reply-To: acs-314159@chop.ucsd.edu
>
> A Message with a reply address.

By seperating messages with cutmarks, you can send more than one message
at once:

> From: me@mysite
> To: mix@zifi.genetics.utah.edu
> Subject: message 1
>
> ::
> Anon-To: recipient1@site1.org
> Cutmarks: --
> 
> Message one.
> --
> ::
> Anon-To: recipient2@site2.org
> 
> ##
> Subject: message 2
> 
> Message two.

The two messages will be delivered seperately.

For added security, you can encrypt your messages to the remailer with PGP.
The remailer software will decrypt the message and send it on.  Here is the
remailer's public key:

- -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

To utilize this feature, create a message with two colons on the first line,
then the Anon-To line, then any other headers, such as cutmarks or latency,
then a blank line, and then the message.  Encrypt this with the remailer's
public key.  Then send it to the remailer, adding the header "Encrypted: PGP".
If you forget this, the remailer won't know that it needs to be decrypted.
Also be sure to use the -t option with PGP, or the linefeeds might not be
handled properly.

Any unencrypted text after the PGP message is also remailed.  This is to
allow sending to someone who is anonymous.  If you create a PGP-encrypted
message to yourself via my remailer, and then you give it to someone, they
can send you a message by sending the encrypted message to the remailer.
The remailer will then decrypt it and send it to you.  The message gets
anonymized in the process, so the sender will need to include a return
address if he wants a reply.

Messages sent this way can be encrypted using the Encrypt-Key: feature.
Any text following a line beginning with ** will be encrypted with this
key.  For example, if you put in your PGP message:

> ::
> Anon-To: you@yourhost.org
> Encrypt-Key: your_password
> 
> **

The appended message after the ** will be encrypted with the key 
"your_password", using PGP's conventional encryption option.
