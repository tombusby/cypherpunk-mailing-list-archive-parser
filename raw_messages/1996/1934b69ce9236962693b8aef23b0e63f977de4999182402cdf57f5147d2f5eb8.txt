>>>VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION, PLEASE
>>>READ!
>>>
>>>There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet.  Ifyou
>>>receive an email message with the subject line "Deeyenda", DO NOT
>>>read the message, DELETE it immediately! DO NOT OPEN !!!
>>>
>>>Some miscreant is sending email under the title "Deeyenda" nationwide,if
>>>you get anything like this DON'T DOWNLOAD THE FILE!  It has a virus that
>>>rewrites your hard drive, obliterates anything on it.  Please be careful
>>>and forward this e-mail to anyone you care about.
>>>
>>>Please read the message below.
>>>
>>>FCC WARNING!!!!! -----DEEYENDA PLAGUES INTERNET
>>>
>>>The Internet community has again been plagued by  another computer
>>>virus.  This message is being spread throughout the
>>>Internet, including USENET posting, EMAIL, and other Internet
>>>activities.  The reason for all
>>>the attention is because of the nature of this virus and the
>>>potential  security risk it makes.
>>>
>>>Instead of a destructive Trojan virus (like most viruses!), this
>>>virus, referred to as Deeyenda Maddick, performs a comprehensive
>>>search on your computer, looking for valuable
>>>information, such as email and login passwords, credit cards,
>>>personal info., etc.
>>>
>>>The Deeyenda virus also has the capability to stay memory resident
>>>while running a host of applications and operation systems, such
>>>as Windows 3.11 and Windows 95.  What this means to Internet users is
>>>that when a login and password are send to the server, this virus
>>>can copy this information and SEND IT OUT TO AN UNKNOWN ADDRESS
>>>(varies).
>>>
>>>The reason for this warning is because the Deeyenda virus is
>>>virtually undetectable.  Once attacked, your computer will be
>>>unsecure.  Although it can attack any O/S, this virus is most likely
>>>to attack those users viewing Java enhanced Web Pages
>>>(Netscape 2.0+ and Microsoft
>>>Internet Explorer 3.0+ which are running under Windows 95).
>>>
>>>Researchers at Princeton University have found this virus on a
>>>number of World Wide Web pages and fear its spread.
>>>
>>>Please pass this on, for we must alert the general public of the
>>>security risks.
