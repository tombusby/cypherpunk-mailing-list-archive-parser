Though I am avoiding commenting on the continuing Vulis nonsense, something
has come up which necessitates my comment.

I received a message from majordomotoad.com saying that my
(alleged/purported) message, "unsubscribe cypherpunks dlv@bwalk.dm.com", is
being forwarded for processing. The full message is included below.

It appears that someone is attempting to make it look like I am trying to
unsubscribe Dmitri Vulis! I assure you all that I have sent no such message
to majordomo@toad.com.

I'm cc:ing Hugh Daniel to make sure he sees this. Perhaps he can look at
the full headers and path information of the alleged message from me and
figure out who is playing this kind of game.
