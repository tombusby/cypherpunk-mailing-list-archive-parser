Either some information is being suppressed, or no information whatsoever is
being suppressed. Whether it's the knowledge how to made strong crypto, or how
to make the A-bomb, or now to make Sarin, or _Mein Kampf_, or uuencoded
pictures of naked kids, really doesn't matter. E.g., many people perceive the
dissemination of Nazi teachings to be as dangerous as the dissemination of a
Sarin recipe. One can't be "a little big pregnant".

I believe that any exception to unlimited free speech, be it libel, or
copyright violation, or child pornography, or Nazi propaganda, or Chinese
dissident materials, just isn't compatible with the cpunk agenda. No censorship
is acceptable. That's an absolute.

There's a widespread misconception that most journalists support freedom of
speech for non-journalists. I deal with journalists occasionally, and my
impression is that the attitude of some of them can be summarized as follows:
"I'm an important guy because I can say something that hundreds of thousands of
people will see/read; and I can libel another person and s/he won't be able to
respond". People with this attitude are very threatened by the Internet. I'm
not saying that all journalists are this way; I'm just pointing out that it's
foolish to assume that just because a person works in the media, s/he's in
favor of free speech, especially unlimited free speech.

Chinese dissidents circumvent their government's restrictions on the net,
and helping neo-Nazis in Germany and helping child pornographers in the
U.S. No one can determine which of the countless bits of information that
travel over the Internet every second are false, or harmful, or subversive,
or otherwise not worthy of transnmission.
