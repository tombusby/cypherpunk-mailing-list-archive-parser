This incident happened very near me, in Greenfield, California, near Salinas.

(No, I was not involved!)

Apparently the "Orchid Ring" (or "Orchid Club") was using a
password-protected system of some sort, according to an article in today's
"Mercury News." The Internet was used, but I don't know the details (e.g.,
whether IRC was used, ordinary e-mail, or some soft of "intranet" linking
the participants).

ObList Relevance: Even if they were not using PGP or the like, it is not a
leap to imagine the usefullness of crypto for such intranets.

It'll be interesting to see how this unfolds.

BTW, from the reports it appears likely that these were indeed "child
pornographers," not simple violators of the CDA. That is, full-fledged
Horsemen of the Infocalypse. As such, potentially powerful ammunition for
those who would like restrictions placed on crypto. (Especially if it turns
out that law enforcement learned of the Orchid Ring through non-encrypted
communications.)
