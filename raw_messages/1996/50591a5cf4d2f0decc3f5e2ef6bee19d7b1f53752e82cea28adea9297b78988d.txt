Really? The RAR archiver is getting quite popular (DOS and OS/2), and uses
a variation of DES in the encryption (according to the authors).  An 
Italian archiver called CODEC also uses DES.  PGP gets more publicity than
any crypto product around (CNN, NPR, Pacifica, NYTimes,  etc.) and will
likely get bigger as time goes on and as the arguments over escrow proposals
get louder.  MS's C[r]API and Netscape also make people more aware of 
strong crypto...

Actually, I don't care one whit.

Doesn't counter my question/argument.  Serious criminals with a few 
braincells who care about wiretapping or protecting their files from 
the authorities will  obviously not use anything that the government
can read.

Even a ban on unescrowed crypto worldwide will not help.  Every copy 
of strong crypto software will not magically disappear upon the 
signing of such treaties and laws.

So?  People can use alternate programs to encrypt the software, such 
as PGP.

Apparently not successful enough, as the two examples I posted 
happened successfully.  Banking trails will exist with or without 
escrow.

1. The damage is already done if rights are violated, irregardless of 
the law.  If the police listen in on your phone conversations because 
of your political views, you may have legal recourse.... but they've 
already listened in.

2. Legislative/judicial protections are meaningless if judges don't 
follow up on them.  Historically they give leeway to the police, and 
as of late judges that enforce the technicalities are lambasted 
publicly for letting criminals go free.

3. Israel isn't exactly a prime example of human rights, especially 
if you're a Palestinian.
