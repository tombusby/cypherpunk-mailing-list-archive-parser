San Jose, Calif., April 30 -- VeriSign, a provider of
digital authentication services for Internet access and 
electronic commerce, has announced the opening of its
online Digital ID Center. VeriSign claims the center is
capable of issuing millions of personal Digital IDs for
World Wide Web and Internet e-mail users. 

Digital IDs use cryptographic techniques to provide a
means of authenticating the identity of each party in an
electronic transaction. A Digital ID is issued by
VeriSign, after background checks are made on an
individual or "entity." Once issued, the Digital ID can
be used within any enabled application such as Netscape
Navigator Internet client software and Netscape
SuiteSpot.
