Interested cypherpunks might want to have a look at:

"A puzzle even the codebreakers have trouble solving: A clash of 
interests over the electronic encryption standard," in the most recent 
issue of Law and Policy in International Business, The International Law 
Journal of Georgetown University Law Center.

Mr. Sean M. Flynn does a fairly good job of outlining the policy issues,
even if perhaps he managed to go a bit light on the NSA and miss some of his
history re: the marketing of broken systems to the private sector and
third world nations, and the mistrust the NSA seems to have earned as a 
result.  I was also disturbed to see him fall into the government's 
"voluntary standard" trap but still, it's really nice to see a legal note 
with cites like:

See e.g., Bruce Schneider, Applied Cryptography (1994)
John Perry Barlow
National Security Agency, Recruiting Brochure
Unclassified Summary: Involvement of the NSA in the Development of [DES]
Marc Rotenberg
Whitfield Diffie
Jim Bidzos
mech@eff.org (I kid you not)
Wired
and
A personal interview with D. Denning

Worth the read, nice bit of research, if lacking in the "spirit" of things.
