Now that we all have web pages that are naughty and might be seen by 
little children, I'd like to hve some kind of a graphic that can 
universally be seen as a "Warning:  The following material is unsuitable 
for children and close-minded twits".  (or words to that effect).

Anybody with much more graphic design ability than I wanna take a crack 
at something that can be spread all over the net?  It shoudl poke as much 
fun as possible at the inaness of the CDA, while still being a legitimate 
effort to warn people that the material is offensive (just in case people 
start getting yanked off the street on CDA violations).
