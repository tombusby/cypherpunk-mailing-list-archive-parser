Libel/Slander is very different from doing a review.  Unfortunately,
in todays legal climate, it is way to easy to find a lawyer that
will harass someone for a negative review.  Unless you are 
prepared to fight such a legal battle, it is much easier to 
do anonymous reviews, and build up a reputation as a good reviewer
through use of signatures, etc.

If you have a good product, and get negative reviews, the truth
will come out eventually through other channels.  Either the product
really isn't good, or the reviewer loses his reputation and his messages
descend into the noise.

Thats life - deal with it!
