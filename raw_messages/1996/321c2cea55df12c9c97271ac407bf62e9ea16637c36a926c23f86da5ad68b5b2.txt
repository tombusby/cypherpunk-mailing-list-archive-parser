I think you are probably right that *in practice* it will not work when the government tries to prevent domestic capital from flowing out and at the same time will allow capital of foreigners to freely flow in and out. After all, government doesn't work. But this doesn't prove the theoretical case that an outflow of capital wouldn't hurt the standard of living of workers in a country. As long as this isn't proven, governments have an excuse to try again and impose controls on capital (and this time of course, they will do it better...)
