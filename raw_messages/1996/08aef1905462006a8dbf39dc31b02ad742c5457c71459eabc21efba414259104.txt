But of course this is a distinction without a difference, at least for all
but 0.00073% of Internet users. That is, downloading a Verilog or whatever
description would be no more "verifiable to the user" than a software-only
program. In fact, the hardware description _is_ just another program!

The government will of course not be fooled by this. Whether one accepts my
point that hardware = software (effectively), the government has heretofore
seen software as an important issue.

In fact, I will take issue with my distinguished colleague (are you
satisfied, Logos?) Ernest Hua's point that only hardware provides real
security. To whit, for several years we on the Cypherpunks list have
advocated this strategy:

-- standardized hardware, such as PCs and Soundlaster cards

-- community-checkable software, such as PGP

This combination is preferable to "black boxes" which the average user
cannot verify (not that the average user can verify, say, PGP, but digital
signatures means the average user can more effectively "trust" the
consensus of those who _have_ looked at, say, PGP 2.6ui, and have vouched
for it.

(This debate came up several times when people proposed specialized
hardware, which would be a) hard to verify, b) hard to distribute widely,
and c) something very few people would casually try. Regardless of our
arguments--though perhaps confirming them--there have been no commonly used
hardware widgets or cards used by any significant number of us.)

I don't think he believes this. Think: FUD. There is no evidence that
properly authenticated PGP is "weak." And if it were, John Deutch would be
a fool to cast doubt on it. I think they're terrified as hell about
software-only approaches running on widely-available hardware and would
like nothing more than to see hardware-only approaches mandated (as this
would provide slightly more control over exports and distibution). Not that
this'll happen, of course.
