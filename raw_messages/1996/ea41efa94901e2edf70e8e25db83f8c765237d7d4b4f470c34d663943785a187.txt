Since when is the government intentionally going to let any bill or 
policy go through that isn't friendly to themselves??? (You don't 
have to be an anarchist to figure that out!)

Nothing is safe from abuse, by the goverment or non-government fols 
alike.  There's always more loopholes to clean up.   (Not that this 
means we shouldn't clean them up... obviously bad policies should be 
fixed...). Just as no crypto is 100% foolproof, no legal system is 
100% abuse-proof.
