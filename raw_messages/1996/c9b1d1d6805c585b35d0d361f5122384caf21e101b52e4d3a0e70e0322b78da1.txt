  The monthly meeting of any Cypherpunks in the San Francisco Bay area
will happen this Saturday May 11th, 12:00 noon till about dinner time
(say 18:00, 6pm).
  We are going to try meeting in back of the Tresidder Union at
Stanford University in the court yard (by the elevator tower).
  Tresidder Union is a little (peninsula) west of the Stanford main
Quad, there is a parking lot just p-west of of the Union that you can
park in on weekends.  The best automotive access is from the west via
Junipero Serra Blvd. (also called Foothill Expressway, Santa Cruz Ave
& Alameda De Las Pulgus) into the 'back' of the Stanford Campus, look
it up on a map folks.  For some semi-useful maps try:
http://www.stanford.edu/home/visitors/maps.html
  There is a chance we will get a room to meet in, in that case there
will be a sign/person telling you where to go.  If not there is a
raised area in the court yard (under the tree) that will be the
gathering area.  In the case of rain (and no room) we will meet in the
pub in the (peninsula) south west corner of the Union.
  If you have things you want to talk about at this meeting, or can
help in some way please email me.
