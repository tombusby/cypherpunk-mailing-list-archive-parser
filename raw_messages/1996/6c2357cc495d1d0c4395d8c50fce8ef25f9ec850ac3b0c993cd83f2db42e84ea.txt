Look back at the first few volumes of Cryptologia in which this debate
was documented -- back in 1978 ff.

The NSA under Adm. Inman tried to get crypto declared born classified,
just like atomic weapons work.  Congress told him NO.

Perhaps it's time for Congress to speak again.

You'd think these folks would take 'no' for an answer....
