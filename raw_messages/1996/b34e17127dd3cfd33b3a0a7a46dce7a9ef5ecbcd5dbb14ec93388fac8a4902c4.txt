As a brief aside to the current discussion.

About 2 days ago, NPR (National Public Radio) had a short news
blurb about a person who was suing U.S. News & World Report. 
It seems that his name appeared on a mailing list that USN&WR
sold to a credit card company (Citibank, I believe).

Basically, his main argument was that the information was private
and that the had the right to control how the information was used.

It should be interesting to see how this case gets settled.

Sorry I didn't post this sooner, but I've been very busy with a 
security assessment for a company in town.

Best Regards,


Frank
