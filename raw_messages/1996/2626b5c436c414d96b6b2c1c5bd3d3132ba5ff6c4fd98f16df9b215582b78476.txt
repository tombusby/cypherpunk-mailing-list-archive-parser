I too have noticed this, but we must remember that although we are 
the people who see the tyranny of censorship etc. all to clearly we 
are in a very small minority, the majority of people do not support 
censorship because they have made a reasoned judgement, the either 
support it because they are too lazy to do anytthing, too shit scared 
of the government if they do, or they just do not take the time to 
understand the issues and so support the common view, there is also 
the case that many people "go with the majority", because they do not 
want to appear different, and the media has so demonized free speech 
and liberty advocated that to associate yourself with them now is 
equivalent to telling people you are a rampant sexually deprived 
paedophile in an anorak.
