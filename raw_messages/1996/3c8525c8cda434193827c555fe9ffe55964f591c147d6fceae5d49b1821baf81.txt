Yes, this is a good point.  It might be addressed by having the later
parts of a multi part message not be identified with the anon ID of the
receiver, but rather with a random message label which is revealed to the
receiver in the first part of the message (encrypted, of course).  Then
the database owner could not tell which message parts went together just
by looking at the messages.  Arrival times might give this away, though,
if all parts of a multi-part message were sent at about the same time.

Yes, there is a tradeoff with the batch size between efficiency and
privacy.  The multi-part message issue does seem to make the problem
potentially worse.  Maybe it would be necessary for anonymous receivers
to mostly receive small messages, and/or make the message granularity
relatively large.

Some of these kinds of volume- or correlation-based traffic analysis
techniques can be countered by requesting dummy messages, ones which the
receiver won't be able to read.  If he asks for five messages every day
from that day's batch then it doesn't leak any information about which
ones are for him.  Asking for a random number averaging five may work
even better, if occasionally he really needs to read six.
