What is unclear, however, is WHY they "had to" build a card that couldn't do 
full-duplex.  I mean, would there have been a problem implementing that?  Or 
was this just another one of those stupid design decisions which could have 
been easily fixed if it had been realized in time?

Well, I assume that if implemented as a new type of modem card, the 
processor can be used to do the data transfer.

I see what you're saying; this makes sense.  Maybe what the industry is 
going to have to do is to start out at 16kpbs, reserving full 2400 bps 
compression for a (near?) future time when network latencies are low and 
predictable.

Fortunately, this is the kind of thing that DSP's are good at...

The local phonecos still want to overcharge for ISDN, however.  Major 
bigtime problem.  ISDN looked great back in about 1980 when the fastest 
common modem was 300 baud, but it's lost much of its lustre competing 
against 33.6 kbps.  Maybe if ISDN were available at a premium of $5 per 
month or so...
