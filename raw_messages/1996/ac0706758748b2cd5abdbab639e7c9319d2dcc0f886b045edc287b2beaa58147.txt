Uh logos... Deal with it.  If I needed some one to walk me through a mailing 
list when it concerns constructive arguements I'd be requesting a moderated
list and since I find moderated news groups to be nonproductive affairs I tend
to find this mailing list perfect for my needs.  As for judging if Tim has 
advanced the arguement or not that is for each person to decide not you.
