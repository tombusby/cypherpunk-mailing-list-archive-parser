A thought:  The way you word your question is likely the way any
regulation will be worded, to wit "mislabeling the content".  I wonder
what might happen to sites that deliberately label their content as
offensively as possible, even though the content is actually benign.
Certainly this is "mislabeling", but you want to bet whether this
inversion gets prosecuted?
