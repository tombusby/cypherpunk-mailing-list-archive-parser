I've also heard that some of these Data Kingpins (shudder!) are making use
of Criminal Money-Laundering Banks (tm), including a bank called "The Mark
Twain Bank"! (I hear that MTB has been offered a deal they cannot refuse.)

These criminal "offshore" banks are of course illegal for ordinary
citizen-units (aka proles) to use, being the sole province of Certain
Government Agencies. Authorized Offshore Criminal Banks, like the Castle
Bank, the Nugan-Hand Bank, and the Bank of Commerce and Credit
International (BCCI) are of course needed by legitimate government as a way
to fund Contra resupply efforts from the Southeast Asian drug trade.

(Seriously, really seriously, our list is generally not a place to obsess
on conspiracies. But anyone who has any doubts about what is going on, and
how some parts of government have become too large/too corrupt, should
spend at least a day or so looking into these things. You should all know
the search keywords by now (BCCI, Mena, Castle Bank, Air America, Khun Sa,
Banco Lavoro del Nazionale, Gehlen, etc.). Anyone who looks into the
tangled web of such dealings will never, ever think the government is
trying to ban encryption so it can protect us from child pornographers.)
