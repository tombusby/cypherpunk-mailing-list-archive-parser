    Interestingly, I talked to the folks developing the Simeon
IMAP-based MUA (the only cross-platform IMAP MUA that I know of; if
anyone else knows of one, please tell me), and they told me that they
knew of the conference and instead decided to focus on getting the
next version of their client out the door.  And they're claiming to
be implementing MOSS, S/MIME, and PGP (PGP/MIME, I hope?).  Pretty
surprising answer, coming from a company that I think will be so
radically affected by the outcome of that workshop and the continuing
work done by the same community of folks.  I don't even know if
they've got someone subscribed to this mailing list (it sounds like
they don't).


    I have no idea if the rest of the PEM/MOSS commercial community
is like this, but I'm not sure it bodes well for them in particular.
I mean, if it really is a matter of them being small enough that one
key guy can't afford to take a few days out (like both Qualcomm and
Z-Code did), then maybe they're too small to survive the shakeout.
And if it's a matter of them not caring, well....

    Somebody else made this observation about the age of MOSS at the
workshop, and as I recall Dave's response was something to the effect
of "Uh, it's actually a heck of a lot older than that, the difference
is that the RFC has only been on the streets for four months."
