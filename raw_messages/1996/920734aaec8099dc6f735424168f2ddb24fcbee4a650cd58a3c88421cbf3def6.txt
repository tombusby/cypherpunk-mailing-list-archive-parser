This is true, but the "old you" can be resurrected if you can get enough 
people to believe your new key using any out-of-band means available
to you.  You can also put a comment in your new key's uid explaining the
problem and how to verify the new key. You will find it very hard to use this 
new key for a while, though, during the transition period. Many people will take 
the existence of two keys with the same uid as suspicious in itself, since it at 
least indicates some kind of attack (even if only a denial of service attack).  
This is really a usability flaw with current PGP.

The PGP formats do allow for a 'revocation' certificate, but PGP doesn't
implement it (yet, I guess).  In any case, it's not really strong enough, 
since what it says is "I retract all my previous statements that this key is 
related to this user".  This'd mean that you'd have to visit everyone who'd ever 
signed your key and get them to issue this retraction. What would be needed 
for this problem is either an "anti-certificate" ("This key does not belong to this 
user"), or else some convention. For example, if two _trusted_ keys are found for the 
same uid, the most recent one could be chosen, and the earlier one be purged 
from keyservers, etc.  This may be possible with current PGP.  I haven't tried it, 
but since I have some keys which have fallen into disuse, I will need to do so 
sometime.).
