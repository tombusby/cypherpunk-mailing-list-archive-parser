I apologize to the list for this last post by Murder, Inc.  My last 
piece of mail was sent privately to Mr. Bell.  He apparently thinks 
it proper to quote private mail in public.  Whatever.

What exactly are your credentials.  Your reputation, of course, 
precedes you.  Given that I should have stopped this idiocy a long 
time ago.

Explain, please, how you would budget in this situation.  Oh, I 
forgot, when the world realizes that Jim is right, everyone will 
learn to live their lives like Jim.

see above.

Hmmm.  How long have you been on the list?  What is it I don't 
understand, specifically.  And in private e-mail.

Explain to me how many campaigns you have run.  Explain to me at 
least a paper you have written (I dont particularly care if you do or 
dont have a degree, my opinions are based upon your ability to assert 
and defend a thesis).   How many people support your ideas?  The 
revolt must be stealth.  Yeah, that's it.

You are right, they do.   In your world, there must be only two 
solutions.  Jim's way or the current way.  Or better yet, just spout 
off.

What is your alternative, Jim.  Oh yeah, kill all the politicians.  
Look to the archives folks.  **PLONK**

Jim, how many politicians do you have regular contact with.  There 
were CongressCritters at my wedding, but you know what?  If I told 
them I just made $10,000 donation to their campaign they would not 
believe me.  You know what else?  You couldn't get close.  Every 
office on the hill knows of the resident nuts.  Its the essence of a 
killfile, nuts are handed off to the intern.  The players are known.  
I don't particularly care if you believe me.  Again what is your 
experience?

If he has already raised 100's of thousands of dollars before, he 
would have no need to deal with you at all.  Especially since, I 
assume from your prior statements that you would get rid of 
contribution limits.

Corporate donations?  Look it up.  Yep, they do.  And after you blind 
the donations, the access will continue to be bought.  Politicians 
can use laws of probability to figure out who has, will and will in 
the future donate.  They can also eliminate a whole bunch of folks.

How many lobbyists do you know Jim?

Did you protest the COS crap?  Well shit Jim, I dont care about the 
content.  Nevermind.

Hmm.  Blame and workability.  What is the connection.  Maybe we can 
all take up a collection so that Jim can go to logic class.

I thought we couldnt complain to the Governement?  Jeez. Jim, your 
confusing me.  God I must be dumb.  Or maybe you are really writing 
in a style that can easily be decrypted to mean something else.  
Yeah, Jim, that's it.

Blame, workability, its like trying to teach a student with no brain.

How many times do I have to explain probability to you?  Jesus, look

Oh, Im sorry.  You must be planning on taking over the world.  Oh 
yeah, I heard all of your friends jumping to your support.  All of 
the political ties you made with all of your experience are jumping 
to your aid.  

I hear only one solitary sound.  ***PLONK***
