Yes.  The same filter software that Exonizes the language could also
replace the whole html body with "Access Denied" if the ratings codes
aren't present.

CERN will already proxy gopher & ftp as well as http.  There is another
package, delegate, that will proxy nntp & telnet.  However, the main
problem with using proxies as a censorship tool is that nothing prevents
the client software from just not using the proxy.  By the time Zippy is
old enough to care about hunting down smut/bomb designs/drug formulae,
Zippy is a lot more likely to know how to do this than the parental units,
in a manner undetectable by the parent (invisible System Folder/Windows
directories with unsanitized browser prefs files comes immediately to mind
- now that 1GB drives are common, it isn't too difficult to hide them)

I agree, if you're going to bother with rating pages, digitally signing the
signature so that terrorist X can't just copy the "Good Clean Fun" rating
code into his Phosgene formula page is the only rational solution.

Gotta love that overhead, though.
