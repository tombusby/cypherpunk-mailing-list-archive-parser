Does anyone else find it worrisome that given 24 bits of a 64-bit key, the
encryption may not be as strong as the same algorithm with a 40-bit key
(e.g., for a variable key-length algorithm like RC4)? In other words, I
suspect some algorithms might not derive their protection mechanisms equally
from each key bit. What if guess the remaining 40 bits is as easy as
guessing the rest of xyl******?

Just pondering.
