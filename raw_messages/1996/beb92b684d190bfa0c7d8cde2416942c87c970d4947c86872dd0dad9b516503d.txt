AwakenToMe@aol.com, in a profound display of stubbornness, continues
to insist that his program to enumerate all possible words of length N
(that is, aaaaa, aaaab, aaaac, etc.) is somehow interesting. I am
therefore forced to drive in the nail with a sledgehammer. Forgive me.

Hardly. A ten year old could do it. I know, since I wrote substantially more
sophisticated stuff when I was ten.

Since you insist, here is less than a minute's work. Yes, I timed it.

The operative portion of the program is six lines ling, and five of
those lines are virtually identical.

You can write the thing much more elegantly, without redundant
code. However, I have elected to leave it as utterly brainless as
possible to demonstrate that ANYONE could write the thing.

Human stupidity is never a surprise.
