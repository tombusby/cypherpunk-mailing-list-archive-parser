  Actually I believe that the quote from Madsen is his overblowing and
misinterpretation of our agreement to sell the government fortezza enabled
products.  There is no agreement that I know of between us and the NSA
regarding anonymity or e-mail.  Since I'm the one doing the code, someone
had better tell me if there is...

  We do not curently allow Java to get access to our mail subsystem.

  I believe that we have always spoken SMTP via direct connection to port 25
on your designated mail server.
