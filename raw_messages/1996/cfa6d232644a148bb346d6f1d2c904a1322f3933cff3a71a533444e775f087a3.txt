To paraphrase, anyone who thinks he can get truly random numbers from Unix
boxes and network timing info is living in a state of sin.

More helpfully, I suggest you do several things:

1. Several textbooks discuss the problems implicit in generating
pseudorandom and "pretty random" numbers. Easier to read what others have
thought about than to spend time writing code that is flawed conceptually.

2. The CP list has discussed RNGs many, many,..., many times. Consult the
archives for a sampling.

3. If network and machine timings have to be used, other people have
written programs that do this. I think Matt Blaze's package includes at
least one such program.

4. I'd avoid altogether phrases such as "generates random numbers," unless
your method uses radioactive decay or Johnson noise measurements, for
example, and maybe not even then.
