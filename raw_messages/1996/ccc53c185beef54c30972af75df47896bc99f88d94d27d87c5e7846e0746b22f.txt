The story previously being promoted says that approximately at the 
Oregon/California border, a fire caused problems with the transmission line.

This morning, I read the new claim: extreme heat (presumably assisted by 
heat dissipated in the power line itself) cause the power cables near The 
Dalles (about 100 miles east of Portland, along the Columbia river) to 
stretch and sag, eventually shorting themselves out to trees near the ground.

I find this claim EXTREMELY hard to believe. The temperature coefficient of 
expansion of steel is about 10 ppm/degree C, which means that even if the 
power lines heated up 200 degrees C, that's only 2000 ppm longer, or about 
0.2%    I don't know the formula to determine the length of a catenary, and 
I'm too lazy to look it up right now,  but I'd imagine that this 0.2% 
increase in length won't increase the amount of sag by more than a factor of 
10 higher, or 2%.   That amount should be almost ignorable if the power line 
was competently installed and maintained.

I've long believed that if incidents such as these were the work of 
saboteurs, it is in the interest of the ordinary citizen that communication 
with those responsible is maintained.  If, on the other hand, the fact of 
the sabotage is covered up, that will only lead to more.  The government, on 
the other hand, has an illegitimate interest in seeing it hidden (where it 
can be hidden; and where the government can't see a good reason to publicize 
it), because if uncovered it would tend to force the government to actually 
deal with the dissatisfied citizenry: not merely the ones doing the 
sabotage, but also the ones who have heard what their motivations are and at 
least partly agree with them.
