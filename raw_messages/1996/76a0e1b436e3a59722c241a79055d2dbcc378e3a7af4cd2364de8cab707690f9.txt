Abstract: 



This paper presents a framework that provides a conceptual understanding of
electronic commerce-based financial services. The paper then discusses some
of the research issues that need to be addressed in this emerging area.
Systematic research o n online financial services is virtually non-existent.
Most of the early work consists of anecdotal evidence from individual
companies, usually in the form of trade journal articles which have no
empirical basis. Clearly there is a need for industry-acade mia
collaboration to understand the online financial services area better. There
is also a need to develop methods and tools for measuring the effectiveness
of these services. Traditional effectiveness measuring methods will be of
limited use in cyberspac e as banks enter an era in which financial products
are treated as information commodities and banks are in competition with
non-banks to serve customers with the best bundle of information
