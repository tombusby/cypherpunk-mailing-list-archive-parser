What kind of telephone card?

Probably a smart card with PK crypto which isn't so easy to defeat.

In terms of technical details, check 2600 magazine (but avoid alt.2600,
since there's more noise there than this group has) or do a web search.
You might want to check other magazines like Hac Tic (no longer printed?)
