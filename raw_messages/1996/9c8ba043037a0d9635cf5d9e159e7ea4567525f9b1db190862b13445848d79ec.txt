Ah, but if we have the capability to do the fully-anon protocol, we can
suddenly do change-making stations.

The change problem is similar to the problem described above:  what if the
payor wants to buy something, but doesn't have the right change?  Going
to the bank to get change will give away who he is.  The solution:
go to your local moneychanger.

A moneychanger accepts, say, a coin for $0.02 and two blinded half-coins
for $0.01 each.  He deposits the $0.02, and if it clears, has the bank sign
the half-coins, which he returns to the payor (he'll probably blind and
unblind those half-coins, too).  The payor now has the right change, and
all the bank can see is that the moneychanger deposited a $0.02 coin and
withdrew 2 $0.01 coins.  Of course, the moneychanger may charge the payor
an extra bit for the privilege.

In the case of the fully-anon protocol, the payee gives a blinded half-coin
to the payor.  The payor then, as above, sends it (and a service fee)
to the moneychanger, who sends it to the bank (or maybe another moneychanger...
echos of remailers...), yadda yadda.

A moneychanger is a very useful construct for protecting _payor_ privacy
when exact change isn't handy.

Note also that with a system like this, there's no real reason for the payor
to even _have_ an account with the bank...

If (when) the ecash library is released, this will all become pretty
straightforward to implement.
