Greetings,

	I did not realize that you were in the Minneapolis Area.  I
am, technically, but am on the road about 98% of the time as the chief
security engineer for SSDS, a integration house.

	Your offer sounds somewhat interesting, especially since I
would not have to relocate.  In either case, are you aware of any
INFOSEC related groups that meet in the Minneapolis area?  If not, do
you think that there would be enough interest to support one?

	-=Chris
