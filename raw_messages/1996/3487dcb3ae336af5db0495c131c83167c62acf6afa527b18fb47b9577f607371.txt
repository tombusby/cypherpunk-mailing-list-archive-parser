I have a great idea for an upgrade to your filter, for that
fateful day when spammers start using your password:


Have your filter reject any incoming mail which is not 1) from
one of your white-listed friends or 2) accompanied by a one U.S.
Dollar "good faith" deposit.  Spammers will not find it
worthwhile to send unwanted mail, because it costs them one
dollar each time.  But people who sincerely have interesting
information for you, even if they are not people on your
whitelist, can send the one dollar "good faith" deposit with a
good chance that you will give the money back to them once you
have read their letter.


Just another example of how Ecash(tm) is going to improve the
Net.
