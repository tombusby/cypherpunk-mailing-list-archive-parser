SCOOPS AND TOP STORIES

MOTHER OF ALL NOTEBOOKS TO BE SHOT OUT OF CANON
Here are some numbers that might keep ThinkPad and PowerBook vendors up late
at night: 200-MHz Pentium processor, 13.3-inch active-matrix display, 1.4GB
hard drive, 8X CD-ROM drive. These formidable figures apply to Canon's
3200FX notebook, appearing in December at a showroom near you. It should
thus become the highest-performance notebook on the market --but is it worth
the price?...

THE WEB VERSION OF DRIVING YOUR CAR AT 325 MPH
Have you been impressed by Peak Technologies' Peak Net.Jet, whose creators
have dubbed it the "turbocharger for the Internet"? If so, keep an eye on
the horizon for Datalytics' Web accelerator, Blaze, which will supposedly
let users surf the Web up to five times faster than they do today. The
company claims that four key weapons in Blaze's arsenal give it the edge
over existing accelerators, not to mention a team of blue-chip bundling
partners...

DEATH, WHERE IS THY...PING?(?)
Maybe you've never been pinged. Maybe you've never known the feeling of
being on the business end of a huge chunk of data that overwhelms and then
shuts down your machine. But if it DOES happen to you (as Karl Malden used
to say), what will you do? What WILL you do? StorageTek's Network Systems
Group claims it has the magic bullet that is a mere four lines long and
takes only seconds to download...

"HONEY? COULD YOU ANSWER THE TOASTER?
I'M TALKING TO FRANK ON THE MICROWAVE..."
Even before the appearance of the much-awaited "information appliances" that
are supposed to help us live like the Jetsons, Mitsubishi Electric America
and Diba are trying to drive down their cost by as much as half using new
chip technology. Some of the miracle gadgets expected include set-top boxes
with email and Web access, Internet-enabled phones with touch-screen
interfaces, and a "tour guide" device with a CD-ROM and built-in camera that
visitors could use in self-guided tours of museums and exhibits. Oh, and
don't forget to ask for the exciting "Toast Waiting" feature...

COMDEX SUCKS! NO, IT RULES! SUCKS! RULES! DOES NOT! DOES TOO!
If you've been to Comdex and survived, how did you manage it? NEWS.COM wants
your war stories. We will publish the best five, and the winners--picked on
a totally subjective basis by our editorial staff--will get supercool CNET
T-shirts. Mail suggestions@news.com, and include the words 'Comdex stories'
in the subject header of your message. To paraphrase the Prez, "Let us feel
yur paynnne..."

OH, SO THAT'S WHY O.J. HAS THAT BATTERED COPY OF NEUROMANCER...
As humorist Dave Barry might solemnly intone, "We are not making this up."
Yes, Virginia, hackers did indeed vandalize the O.J. Simpson civil trial
section of AOL's Court TV site. A user reported that when he clicked onto
the particular section, a screen popped up with the words, "This area is
under construction," and, "It's a PIC of OLAF." Such esoteric language puts
this one right up where with Dan Rather's surreal "Kenneth, what is the
frequency" episode...
