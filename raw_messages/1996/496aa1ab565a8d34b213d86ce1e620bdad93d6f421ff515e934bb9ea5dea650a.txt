I am glad to see this clarification on the signature policy.  (Sorry for the
paranoia, but I have reasons to be wary of plans made in Redmond...) 

The article that I quoted in the first post was quite misleading as to a
number of points.  (Which is why I should not believe things written in one
page articles, but that is another point...) With the author's credentials,
I would have expected a wee bit more accuracy (or clarity).

I do have a number of comments on what you posted, however...

This is a good thing.  (This was clarified after I posted by a developer who
had returned from an MS developers conference on Internet Apps.) It is also
nice to see that there will be more than one option of signing services.
Hopefully the policies will not be such as to shut out the small,
independant web designers/developers.

Actually it protects against mallicious code (for the most part), but not
against badly designed code.  I can see where improperly tested and designed
code could cause problems on host machines.  I have not seen anything that
makes OLE code more secure (or more stable) in the real world environment.
(Just lots of paperwork being signed that says "We will not use these powers
for Evil".)

With Java, there has been alot of work to make the language less subject to
abuse.  I have not seen anything in that regards involving OLE.

This is a good thing.  And I hope that they release them to the rest of the
world before implementing them and releasing in a bunch of MS products.
(This is one of my big beefs with Microsoft.  I have seen a number of cases
where APIs are released to developers MONTHS after they appear in Microsoft
products.  Not cool.)

I am glad to hear it.  Before this thread i had not heard of a Mac version.
(Maybe it is becuase my friends who use the Mac have dropped using any
Microsoft products.  Come to think of it, it was because of how Word for the
Mac implemented OLE...  (Among other things.))

The part that interests me about the signing of executables is not for
distribution over the web.  (I beleive that OLE is not abuse proof enough
for that yet.)  What I would like to see is an API (or internal routines) to
allow the app to check the signature opon loading and perform checks to
detect tampering within the executable.  This I see as a very useful thing,
mpore so than the web applications.  Is such a thing planned?

Also, is there a web page that has additional information/plans about this API?
