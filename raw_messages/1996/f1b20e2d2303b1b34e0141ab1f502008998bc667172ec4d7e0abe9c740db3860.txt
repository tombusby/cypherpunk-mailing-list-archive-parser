I have been collecting information about crypto libraries for the Mac
Crypto conference next week.  Here is what a quick AltaVista search came up
with.  Since you want C++, I would particularly look at Wei Dai's Crypto++
library.  If anyone has other strongly recommended libraries, please let me
know.


Crypto Libraries
 
  http://www.clark.net/pub/cme/ has source for MD5
 
  http://www.homeport.org/~adam/crypto/ for a comparison of crypto
  libraries
 
  http://www.enter.net/~chronos/cryptolog1.html has a collection of
  links to crypto resources
 
  http://www.openmarket.com/techinfo/applied.htm - Internet Locations 
  for Materials on the Disks for Applied Cryptography
 
  Crypto++ in C++ by Wei Dai. -  Has been tested under Codewarrior
