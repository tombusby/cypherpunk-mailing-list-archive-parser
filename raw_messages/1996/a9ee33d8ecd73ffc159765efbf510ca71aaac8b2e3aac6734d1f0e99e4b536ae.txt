All the 360K 5.25" drives I've ever tried were capable of going to track 43
reliably (regular PC DOS format used 40). But I've come across too many
1.44/3.5" drvies that don't go beyond 80. Can't count on it. However...

It's possible to squeeze more sectors on 5.25" and 3.5" disks too, especially
if you specify shorter gaps. It's also possible to vary sector size.

When I read the above paragraph, I thought momentarily: it takes A LOT of bytes
to specify the format of a floppy disk. Could one use this as a kind of
encryption? I.e., the key would be the format specs, and it would have to
be supplied to the device driver before it could read the actual data from
the floppy. Unfortunately, I think a clever analysis of the disk with just
the regular FDC can tell you a lot about the formatting (i.e., the number and
the size of the sectors, and even their physical order).

This is extremely cool indeed.

Trivia question: is it true that the reason why a lot of hard disks have
a prime number of sectors per track (like 17) so that you can use different
interleave factors (which have to be relatively prime to the # of sectors)?

Only a few weeks ago I gave away a NEC V20 motherboard capable of running CP/M.
(I recall running CP/M on it at some point. Of course, its main purpose was
being an 8088 clone.) Why not. :-)

It would be even cooler to port PGP to BESM-6. (How many people on this
list have ever used a BESM-6?)
