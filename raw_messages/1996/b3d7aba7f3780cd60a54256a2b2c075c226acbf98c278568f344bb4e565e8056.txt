Isn't using a hash as the identifier replicating the key distribution
problem that PGP has or are you including some other data that can be used
to look up the cert?  I think a problem occurs when you have 20 billion of
these certs (two for every person in the year 2010 or such).  A simple hash
into a table isn't going to cut it because you a single database (with
replication?) isn't going to be possible.  Some hierarchical lookup like
DNS is going to be needed. The look ups are needed to check for revocation.
