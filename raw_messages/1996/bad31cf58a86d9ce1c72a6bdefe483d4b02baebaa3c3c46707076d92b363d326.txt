Why is this so surprising? We are nothing more than a manifistation of those
self same forces. It is not us manipulating nature, it is nature
manipulating nature. This is why there are no Truths and what we do know of
truth is more a tale about us than about what we 'know' of the universe..
The universe is sentient, and we are it (as far as we know).

What you and others offer is a bipolar anthropocentic example of the schism
our rapid technology has generated in our lives.

There is no absolute truth. As I have stated before when this issue has
arisen, the truth we all see and know so well is nothing more than a
representation of what good pattern recognition engines our brains are.
One which makes mistakes in easily proven ways (e.g. optical illusions).

Actualy I have been building robots for nearly 20 years now.
