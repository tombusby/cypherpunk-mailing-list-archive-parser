READ TODAY'S OBSERVER ARTICLE - THEY SINK TO THEIR TRUE LEVEL!

Today, September 8, the Observer publish a follow-up-follow-up article
for their amazing "child porn" expose which so grossly libelled Clive
Feather and Johan Helsingius ... a review of the "first" toddler
CD-ROM... How have the mighty crusaders fallen !  Sic transit gloria
mundi.... Actually, the Observer new technology reporters may have
found their true niche at last - it's a bit egotistic for the reporter
to print such a large picture of himself, though !

Read it all at

PS:  Private Eye published an intelligent and amusing commentary on
this whole sorry business recently, and scallywag.com will post it,
but, in deference to PE, not until the current issue goes off sale.
