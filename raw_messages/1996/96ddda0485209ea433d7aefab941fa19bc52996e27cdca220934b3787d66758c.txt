It's interesting that we even HEARD about Coventry, but of course that was a 
British decision, a civilian target in an attack during an era where there 
were already plenty of attacks on civilian targets, and the British 
UNDERSTOOD why Coventry had to die.  (But I don't know WHEN "we" (the 
general public) first heard about Coventry.  Anybody know?

(For the historically-impaired:  Coventry was/is an English town (small 
city?) perhaps most famous from the Lady Godiva legend...but I digress...    
 British found out, I guess through Ultra, that it was going to be bombed.  
Telling the inhabitants would have saved many lives, but (possibly) alerted 
the Germans that Enigma had been broken.  British made the correct choice:  
Let the city get bombed without (much?) warning.  The value of keeping the 
broken-ness of Ultra a secret far outweighed the value of Coventry.)
