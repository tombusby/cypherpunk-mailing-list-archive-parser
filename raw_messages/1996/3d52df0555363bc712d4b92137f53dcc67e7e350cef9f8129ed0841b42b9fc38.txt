There's a name collision on the word "hash" here.  Carl was using both
hashes in the same sentence.  A "cryptographic hash" is a strongly one-way
mapping from an input string (in this case a public key) to a number.
A hash table is a data structure that uses a mapping from an input string
to a number to decide where to put things.  An MD5 cryptographic hash
function used on PGP public keys (e.g. to get the fingerprint) is
64 bits long, so there may be a few collisions if there are 2**34 keys
out there; if things scale to that point, PGP 4.1.3 need to use SHA for
fingerprints instead (or in addition).  Carl is proposing using a 
hash table (indexed by a hash-table hash of the cryptographic hash)
to store public keys; that's a separate problem, though of course if you
want to store 20 billion keys in one place, there are better data structures
than simple hash tables.
