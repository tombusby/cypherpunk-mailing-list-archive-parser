Your clarification does not improve things. The notion that the "govt would
only be able to regulate commercial and/or public systems" is wrong. (There
may be a very few situations involving product safety, fraud, etc....many
of us disagree with even these interventions, of course.)

Think of it this way: "govt would only be able to regulate commercial
and/or public word processors." The government has no authority to
"regulate" word processors, commercial or otherwise.

The United States government does not receive software submissions "for
govt approval."

I really think you need to look into what the role of the U.S. government
actually is, with regard to programs. (It is always important to remember
that there are no laws whatsover about the types of software individuals or
businesses may use, save for some specific laws about such things as racial
discrimination, sexual harassment, taxes, etc. But no laws about crypto,
word processors, etc. And the government has no "Sofware Approval Office.")

I guess we will have to agree that we are unable to find a common basis for
communication.
