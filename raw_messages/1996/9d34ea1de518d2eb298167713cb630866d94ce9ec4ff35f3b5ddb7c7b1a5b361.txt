Starting off with defamation is a sure tipoff that what follows is crap.
And sure enough...

No. I'm referring to the consortium of small phone companies that asked the
FCC to stop it, in contrast to big phone companies which explicitly refused
to join in that request. The big ones were both long-distance carriers and
big local ones (a distinction that will soon disappear).

I'm doing no such thing. I'm reporting the empirical data. Have you some
problem with facts?

I'm not sure this is accurate. The ADSL modems are already down to the
price of v.34s at the start of v.34 and ADSL is still in its initial stage.
Being able to sell 6 MEGAbyte/sec bandwidth over ordinary copper phone pair
will increase telco revenues substantially with little additional cost
except at the switch. Switch mods don't require replacement and their cost
per dollar of revenue (even if they give away 6Mb bandwidth at ISDN prices
for 128Kb bandwidth) is pretty low. They could even charge what the cable
guys do for basic service (using video dial tone), add current charges for
local phone service, include a free Internet connection, and make money. In
fact, PacBell stopped wiring California for fiber and simply buried
incomplete cable in most locations last year because ADSL is so much better
a deal, infrastructure cost-wise. If you haven't already done so you should
check out the web sites for the ADSL consortium.

ATM is going bye-bye according to the trade press. It IS too expensive. As
for the synchronous circuit, if you're talking a signalling path that's
provided for and takes a tiny part of the bandwidth. At the switch it won't
look any different than today's call routing.

Now we're back on topic. Dunno how the increased bandwidth will be paid for
if lots of people start doing internet phone. Perhaps a new pricing model
with metered, but not distance-sensitive rates. Perhaps a special charge
for voice packets. Perhaps the number of subscribers attracted by cheap
phone will be enough to pay for the bandwidth under current pricing models.
Perhaps the split between the ISPs and the backbones will have to change.
Love will find a way.

Last time I looked my ISP was charging me about $20 a month--hardly "free".
And business users pay more.

Naah. The existing bandwidth that would go dark if phone calls shifted to
the net would become available. And I understand there's a huge amount of
dark fiber already in existence. I don't think this is the scarce resource.
I'ts starting to look like you're attempting proof by assertion rather than
referring to the known data.

I will refrain from heaping scorn on what appears to be a wild set of
ill-thought-through and uninformed objections. Your better-informed
colleagues will do it for me. If it's any comfort, I thought exactly as you
do until I started to read the discussions of this topic by experts.

(By the way there's a lot of material on Internet Phone on AT&T's web site.)
