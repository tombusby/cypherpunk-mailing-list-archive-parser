Timmy May might be telling the truth for a change - he's so clueless
about computers that he probably has nothing to do with maintaining
majordomo and knows nothing about it.

Here's what's been happening: several times over the last two weeks I
received notices from majordomo@toad.com saying that I've been
unsubscribed from the cypherpunks mailing list. I emphasize that I've
never asked to be unsubscribed. Whenever I got such notice, I sent a
"subscribe cypherpunks" back to majordomo, and would get back a "welcome
to cypherpunks" blurb within an hour.

About last Thursday, I was forcibly removed from the mailing list again,
and majordomo stopped replying to any commands (subscribe, who, help)
sent from any address with dm.com in it. The mail doesn't bounce; it
just goes into a black hole. However, when I e-mail it "who cypherpunks"
or "who coderpunks" from an address in another domain, I get a response
(the list of subscribers) within minutes (so majordomo@toad.com is up)
and I see that I'm no longer on either list.

If the majordomo hasn't been "instructed" to ignore my attempts to
re-subscribe, then it must have done so on its own free will. :-)

And some space aliens in a flying saucer must have repeatedly
unsubscribed me against my wishes. :-) :-)

And Timmy May's credibility keeps growing by the hour. :-) :-) :-)

I've sent a couple of responses to cypherpunks@toad.com to e-mails that
were cc:'d to me. Apparently they _were distributed (I think so because
a certain Timmy May clone sends back to me a copy of everything I send
to c-p with the word "fuckhead" at the end.)

I can't say that I miss the non-stop ethnic/religious flames and
ruminations about "brute force attacks on one-time pads" much...
