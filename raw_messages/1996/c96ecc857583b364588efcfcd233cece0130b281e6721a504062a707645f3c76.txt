This isn't enough - keyservers are NOT a substitute for the
Web Of Trust.  You probably need to have the authenticating key
signed by other well-known-in-the-target-community keys.
I don't know if you plan to use one authenticating public key
for future jobs, or use a different one each time; in the latter
case you'll also want to have a key to sign that one with.

Fingerprint is critical - otherwise you're subject to the "0xdeadbeef" attack.
You could also include the key itself in the signed message, if you don't
mind a bit of extra volume.

The main alternative to PGP keys is Haber&Stornetta's "Surety" notary system -
they use trees of hashes to establish that a given document was 
authenticated at a given time, making the trees publicly available,
and the weekly master hash gets printed in the New York Times classifieds
weekly.
At minimum, you may want to notarize your PGP key that way.
