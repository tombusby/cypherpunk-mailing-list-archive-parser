Although Digicash's ecash offers anonymity to the payor it does not to the
payee.  The reasons have to do with the way coins are blinded.  So LE
could, with the bank's cooperation, easily associate the two sides of a
transaction.  This was intentional on Chaum's part, either for moral or
practical political considerations.  Its probably only a relatively minor
patch to allow one ecash purse (the kidnapper's) to generate the blind
token values so that another (similarly patched) purse (the vicitim's) can
submit them to the mint and return the minted coins to the kidnapper (e.g.,
by posting on a popular Usenet group).  In this scenario the only
reasonable way left to track the money is via linkage (the size and timing
of deposits and withdrawls in the kidnapper's account).
