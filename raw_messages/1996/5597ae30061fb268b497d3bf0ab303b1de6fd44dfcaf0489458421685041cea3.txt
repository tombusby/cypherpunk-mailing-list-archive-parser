What a pain in the ass! You leave town for a bit and the backlog gets 
insane! Anyway, http://www.dis.org/se7en/  and click on DC-Digest for 
those of you who wanna save your inbox. Other issues will appear 
tomorrow, starting with more recent, and going back to the older.

All signal, no noise. Each post is hyperlinked from a table of contents, 
and every follow-up post is hyperlinked to the original post. All email 
addresses and URLs are also hyperlinked. Order is *slighty* skewed to 
read more coherently, and can be read from top to bottom for maximum 
effectiveness.

Off to bed,

se7en
