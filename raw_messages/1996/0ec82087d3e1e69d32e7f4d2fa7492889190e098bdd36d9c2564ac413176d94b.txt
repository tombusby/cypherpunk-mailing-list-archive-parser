Unisys owns the patent for LZW compression which GIF (and TIFF and many other programs) utilizes. Unisys is the company that put pressure on CIS because CIS had developed the GIF format. 

CIS did nothing other than ruffle many peoples feathers and inspire the PNG team to create a new spec. JPEG support was inevitable across the board.

If I remember correctly the LZW patent expires next year.

The interesting patent I'm waiting to bubble to the top of pond is the one that covers the display of advertising material in a software program. I'm not making that up!
