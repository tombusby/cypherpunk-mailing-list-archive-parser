I think you're wrong about that.  You're confusing copyrights and
trademarks, I believe.  It's a trademark that you lose by not asserting it
or defending it.  Someone please correct me if I have this wrong :)

There have been claims that the copyrights were not transferred properly
from Hubbard to RTC, but they have yet to be proven in court.

CoS won against Arnie Lerma in a summary judgement.  Copyrights were
definitely the issue in that decision.

The ugly provision in the Leahy bill had to do with obstruction of criminal
investigations, didn't it?  The CoS copyright cases have all been civil.  I
don't see how it applies.

That part of the bill stunk, I agree...
