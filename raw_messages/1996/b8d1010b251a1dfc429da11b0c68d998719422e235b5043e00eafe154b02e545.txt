Or how about those TrashShack kits everyone buys a science-oriented kid
(until you warn them not to)?  Geez.  It's about as fun as one of those
slide-show demo programs.

Gee, you too?  I probably could have broke the $30k mark, though, if given
the chance. Still could, easily, but it'd be Computer Shopper now.

Hehe ...

Bonus points if you get the reference.

Many others are devoted to "the study of Chaotic systems involving realtime
exothermic reactions with common household substances". (Pyromania might not
be a bad sub title)

Others still are most interested in Brute Force Wallet Extraction.  Or, of
course, the ever popular: Members of the Opposite Sex and How to Attract
Them.
