>      HP UNVEILS NEW CRYPTO CONTROL FRAMEWORK
> 
>      Hewlett-Packard announced a new framework technology designed to let
>      governments enable and disable strong cryptography products. The
>      framework is independent of the method used in a given product. The
>      heart of the system is a small, tamper-resistant module with the
>      cryptographic algorithms that remain dormant until activated. A policy
>      activation token (basically some key bits) can be used to choose
>      between the various crypto algorithms stored on the module. The HP
>      press release makes this sound like the greatest thing since public
>      key encryption, but in reality it appears to be just another attempt
>      to insert government control into private data exchanges. Look for
>      legislative attempts to make this technology mandatory on all
>      encryption products. Technology details are at the site.
