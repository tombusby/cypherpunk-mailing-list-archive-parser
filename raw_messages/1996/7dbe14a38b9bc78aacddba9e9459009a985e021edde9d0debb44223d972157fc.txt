Your example is so misleading that it's wrong.  Cities generally attack motels by threatening to pull their licenses, which is usually called an "administrative process" and thus few of the usual protections apply.

They do if they've been harassed by the city, for example Portland Oregon to name the closest example I know.

"Criminally", probably not.  Civilly, probably if the victim's family has a good enough lawyer.

>(If I lend my chain saw to a ranting, foaming maniac, am I liable? Perhaps.)

Actually, then you're CRIMINALLY liable, as well.

Actually, that's wrong.  The question will be asked, "Do you regularly lend your phone to strangers who you can't even see, no questions asked, without listening in to see that nothing untoward is being plotted?"  _THAT's_ a more apt analogy.

If your phone was already tapped, and the delivery occurred in your house, you'd better look for new accomodations.

I prefer not to wait until the Pollyannas of this world have been proven wrong.

Justa sec:  The Leahy bill makes "encryption furtherance of a felony" 
illegal.  Sending encrypted packets out of the country, containing material 
you don't know (because they're encrypted) sounds like a classic opportunity 
to declare you in violation of some "conspiracy to violate the law" of some 
OTHER country, which is probably considered a Federal felony.

Welcome to prison, Tim.  Your optimism will serve you well, there.

BTW, it is clear that you haven't yet read Mr. Junger's analysis of the 
bill.  Nobody except a government stooge could read that and not wonder why 
anybody would support that bill.  A complete re-write is called for.
