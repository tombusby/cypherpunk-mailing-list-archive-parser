But are you "big" (by whatever standard) enough to admit that
"judgement" of others is the error?

Why go that far? 

The people *I* generally invite to parties are quite capable of
handling whatever disturbance arises, being "big enough" to realize
that "disruptive influences" are only disruptive if one allows them
that ability.

If I've invited someone who cannot handle their own ability to be
disrupted, only -then- is my judgement in "error" by the standard
of "error" you seem to be espousing.

"Proper" in the sense you seem to mean it, implies that you understand
the goal Mr. Gilmore had in mind in allowing everyone to join the
list.

Well. -I-, on the other hand, am so big that I have no need to
copiously announce the obvious fact of my imperfection to the world,
so I can afford to pretend that I am perfect.

A passerby caught Nasrudin prying open the window of his own bedroom from 
the outside in the depths of night. "What are you doing? Locked out?"
"Hush!" came the reply. "They say I walk in my sleep. I am trying to surprise
myself and find out."
