The "passphrase" is not for access to the remailer, but so that the
remailer can itself decrypt incoming messages encrypted to its public key.
An automated remailer is like a little guy sitting at the machine, taking
in incoming messages, decrypting the ones that are addressed to him, and
taking furhter actions.

In Chaum's hardware-based "digital mix," the scripts, etc., for this are
stored in tamper-resistant hardware, making the attack Hal describes much
harder. (Chaum was thinking that mixes needed hardware security about 15
years ago.)

Unix-based remailers, and the like, don't rely on secure hardware.

We've talked about possible hardware security measures, even those that
only rely on physical box security. A box that does decryption, mixing,
readdressing, etc., without being part of a Unix file system/network, could
be a useful "Mom and Pop remailer" (the idea being that small shop owners,
"Mom and Pop," could set this up, collect a little bit of spare change as a
remailing fee, and not even have access to the internal state of the
machine themselves.

At a Cypherpunks meeting a couple of years ago we spent some time
brainstorming this. It seemed plausible that a small outfit could make such
"remailer boxes" and sell them cheaply. (Hardware prices have plunged even
further.)
