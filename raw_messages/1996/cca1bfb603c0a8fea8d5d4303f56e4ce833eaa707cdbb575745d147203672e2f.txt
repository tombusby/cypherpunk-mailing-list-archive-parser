This is what I was groping for before, I think. I would like to set up an
anonymous remailer, but I have little to no idea how to go about it. I need
something that I can set up cheaply and easily on a machine that I don't
have root on, and that I could close down in a flash if there was a problem.

 I'm proposing a stop-gap measure that could take some of the heat off
genuine remailers - simple, easy-to-create remailers that do nothing except
anonymize the fullscale remailer that's being used. If you make it so that
Type-I and Type-II remailers can _only_ remail to these simple remailers as
well as other remailers, you've insulated them from the overt threat of
being caught as the last remailer in the chain. Hopefully the number of
full-scale remailers would then start increasing instead of decreasing if
there is less reason to threaten them.

As for traffic analysis uncovering the previous remailer in the chain: how
would discovering that the previous remailer in the chain was
utopia.hacktic.nl be any different from the message actually appearing from
utopia.hacktic.nl? The Church of Scientology doesn't have the resources to
do full-scale traffic analysis, so hacktic's role would never have been
discovered.  And what would you do if it turned out that the previous
remailer was middle-man@alpha.c2.org? Who do you prosecute?

You either pay up as your income allows you, or you file for bankruptcy.
Neither option is likely to make other remailer operators feel good about
themselves.
