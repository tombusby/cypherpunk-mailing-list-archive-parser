I think this is hard to do in practice.  I have tried.

(This goes under 3.1 or 3.2 of my outline, which you may not have received yet.)

My idea is that the lack of noise is used as evidence to get a search
warrant.  The search warrant is used to get the evidence to put you away
forever.

(This goes under 3.3 of the outline.)

The severe penalties and significant chance of capture will keep the number
of cryptoanarchists low.

Excellent point, especially since you don't have an encrypted virtual
disk.  Can anybody resolve this?

(Under 3.3)  I would have a hard time memorizing these programs.  This
pretty much guarantees that the number of cryptoanarchists will be small.

(I am deeply envious of your legal right to post this code, however.
Now, why was it that we broke away from the Mother Country?)

I would like to see a longer exposition of your approach.  Given
a hostile environment, how would I operate a small anonymous perl
coding service using your techniques?  Don't forget to tell me how
I get paid and when I get to spend my "ill-gotten" gains and how
nobody will notice that I am doing it.
