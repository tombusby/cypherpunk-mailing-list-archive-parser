Interesting, yes.  Also a possible attack...

Alice sends a PGP'd message to Charlie, but gets a reply from
"Charlie" saying that they original key was lost due to a hard drive
crash, etc.... and that she should coinsider it revoked.

Is that message from Charlie or from Mallet (the demonic SysAdmin),
who is trying to get in between Alice and Charlie...?
