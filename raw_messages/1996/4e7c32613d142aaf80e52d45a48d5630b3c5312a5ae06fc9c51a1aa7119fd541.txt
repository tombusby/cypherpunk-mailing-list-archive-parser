This is incorrect.

Firefly actually looks at what you have recommended and then finds others
who have recommended or favor the same songs/albums/groups and selects new
groups albums or songs based on the number of people who agree with your
recommendations who suggest them.

i.e. if you give the eagles a 5 out of 5, and 20 others also gave the
eagles high ratings, the system weeds out what other groups those 20 gave
high ratings to and suggests them to you.  As you confirm or deny your
interest in those groups, the system narrows it down even more, using
those choices to find others who seem to have similar tastes to you and
suggesting albums and groups not yet in your file which have been
recommended by those with tastes like yours.

This trancends genres.  It's quite a nice system.

It also makes an important point about reputations.  Using a catagory
reputation scale is, as the author above describes, not very efficient.
