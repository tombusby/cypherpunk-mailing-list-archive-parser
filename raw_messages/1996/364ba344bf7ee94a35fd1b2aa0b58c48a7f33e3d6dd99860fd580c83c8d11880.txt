And I told myself I wouldn't respond to this thread anymore.  Oh well.  I 
just don't want to be misinterpreted.

I never meant to imply (and don't think that I did), that the attacks 
against MD5 were insignificant.  As I said, I'm moving to SHA in any 
software I develop from now on.

What I said was the attacks were insignificant in the application being 
considered (rsync) and that MD5 was not completely broken.  Come on, all 
the guy wanted was a fast 128 bit checksum.

For example, I am still using PGP clearsigning which, of course, uses MD5. 
Dobbertin indicates that his attack cannot be used against me as long as I 
only sign messages that I create myself.  Yes, PGP would work better with 
SHA.  I'd be able to sign documents that others created with (more) 
certainty.  But that doesn't mean that I should stop using PGP.


P.S. I apologize to the list for flooding this list recently.  
Unfortunately, I took it a little too personally when Perry told me to 
"stop spewing inaccurate information" and to "quit posting".  It was late, 
and I let him bait me more than I ordinarily would.

Now I find myself running in circles trying to make sure that I've made 
myself clear and that no one else (other than Perry) is misintepreting what 
I'm saying.
