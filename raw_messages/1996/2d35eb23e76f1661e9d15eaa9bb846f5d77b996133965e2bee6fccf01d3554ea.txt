Sorry for the delay. RSAREF for Mac is the same as any other RSAREF; RSAREF
is distributed as fairly portable C source. For a recent project, I just
added the sorce files to a Metrowerks project and built and it worked fine.
It compiles without errors or warnings on all the Mac platforms I've tried
thus far (it does generate "possible unintended assignment" warnings (for
assignments inside of if statements) if you've got that turned on).

If you're having problems, feel free to drop me a note.
