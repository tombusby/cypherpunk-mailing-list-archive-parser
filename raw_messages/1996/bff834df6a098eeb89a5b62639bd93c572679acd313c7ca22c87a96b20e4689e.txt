I released version 2.0 of Puffer, my symmetric encryption program for Windows last 
month.  The exportable shareware version (40-bit RC4, uh, I mean PC1) is available 
from my web site (http://execpc.com/~kbriggs).  The registered version uses 160-bit 
Blowfish.  Both versions have a secure wipe feature and a built-in editor for 
on-the-fly e-mail encryption.
