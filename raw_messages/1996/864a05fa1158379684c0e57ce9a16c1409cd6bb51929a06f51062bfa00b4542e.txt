While I warms my heart to know that the American Family Association thinks
the Communications Decency act is a dud, the following message demonstrates
that the organization does not intend to let the issue rest.

Specifically, they're now seeking to expand the scope of Internet Service
Provider (ISP) liability for "indecent" content. That makes about as much
sense as asking AT&T to censor your telephone conversations, but
regardless... the bottom line is that the American Family Association is
*very* determined to impose its social agenda on cyberspace through
government legislation.

Moreover, at this point it's hardly clear to what extent ISP's are or are
not liable for online content under the CURRENT provisions of the
Communcations Decency Act.  Given this ambiguity, a more stringent
clamp-down would only expand the "chilling effect" on free speech.

Spread the word!

COMPUTER PORNOGRAPHY LAW NOT WORKING, SAYS AFA

WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 /PRNewswire/ -- American Family Association issued the
following: "Less than one week after the Communications Decency Act was
signed into law by President Clinton, it is obvious that the law, designed
to curb computer pornography, is not working and never will work," said
Patrick Trueman, director of American Family Association governmental
affairs.  This fact was made clear by the action this week of CompuServe, a
major access provider to the Internet, to restore access to pornographic
Internet sites it had recently blocked under pressure from German
prosecutors.

Access providers to the Internet have a financial incentive to provide
access to pornography and they will not block such sites until they are
under a legalobligation to do so, Trueman said.  The Communications Decency
Act included specific provisions protecting access providers from criminal
liability and until those provisions are repealed, CDA will be nearly
useless, he added.

Trueman wrote to leaders of pro-family groups today urging them to unite
behind a tough anti-pornography measure like that sponsored by Congressman
Henry Hyde.  The Hyde measure, which would have made anyone liable who
knowingly and intentionally provides pornography to children or obscene
pornography to anyone, was defeated in committee by supporters of CDA.
"The reality is CDA does not work and it will never work.  For its
enforcement it relies on a massive number of prosecutions by the Justice
Department of individuals who put illegal pornography on the Internet while
the major distributors and money makers from the distribution of
pornography -- the access providers -- are given a free ride," Trueman said
in his letter to pro-family leaders.

Trueman urged pro-family leaders to act now to change the law. "There is no
point in waiting months or years.  CompuServe has made that clear in its
recent actions which demonstrate that the law has little, if any, deterrent
effect," Trueman said in his letter.
