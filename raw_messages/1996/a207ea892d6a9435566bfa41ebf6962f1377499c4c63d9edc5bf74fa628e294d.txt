That is not quite true.  There are other sites that use the cookies.  (It is
not very common though...)

One of the reasons that it was not used very much is that the first
implementation of cookies did not leave them after you exited Netscape.
There are a couple of server tools that utilize the cookie spec.  (I would
have to check the stack of sales stuff to verify which ones...)
