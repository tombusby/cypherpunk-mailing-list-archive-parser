    I have actually had Secure File System, Secure Drive, and Secure Device
    all installed with mounted volumes at the same time under Win95.  However,
    32bit file access is not the problem.  When you load a TSR in Win95, the
    operating system forces you into 16bit DOS compatability mode.  I'm not a
    kernal guru so I can't explain all the specifics, but it basically makes
    95 act as Win-3.11 and looses multithreading (as it were) and creates
    serious memory paging problems if you have >32mb installed.

You've got this all wrong. Only certain types of TSRs cause 
this. I'll leave it to an expert and just quote the author of secdrv:

    Thanks for the reply though .. and if you need assitance with getting
    SECDEV working under 95, just drop me a note.

Thanks for the offer ...
