Dear Friends of Music Boulevard:

We're excited to announce a major redesign of Music Boulevard, 
the Ultimate Online Music Store(tm).  We invite you - as someone
who has visited and/or opened an account with us - to check out 
our new look at WWW.MUSICBLVD.COM!

Many of the changes and improvements we have made are in response 
to your feedback.  The new Music Boulevard is faster, contains more
content, and is easier to navigate.  Our fantastic collection of 
music magazines and Billboard(r) charts are now available to everyone!  
We think you'll really enjoy shopping in our new environment.

We are also pleased to introduce the Music Boulevard Frequent Buyers 
Club. Membership in the Frequent Buyers Club is free. Once you sign-up, 
you will be rewarded with a free CD of your choice for every 10 you 
purchase!  

As always, we continue to provide the best Customer Service of any 
site on the internet.  We have recently added more customer service
representatives who will be glad to assist you with your inquiries.

We'd like to thank you for visiting Music Boulevard, and we'd be
very interested in your feedback on our new interface. If you have 
any questions, feel free to contact us at 1.800.216.6000 or
610.293.4793.  Our email address is service@musicblvd.com.

Sincerely,

The Music Boulevard Staff
