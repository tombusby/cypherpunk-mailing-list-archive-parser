Don't you think you should read the bill prior to condmening those
that support it?

The bill states "Americans should be free to lawfully use whatever
particular encryption techniques, technologies, programs, or products
developed in the marketplace they desire in order to interact
electronically worldwide in a secure private, and confidential
manner;"

The bill gives everyone the right to use whatever publically available
encryption scheme they chose.  The provisions you refer to about key
esrow simply require the escrow agent to be responsible in handling
your key, this provision is to protect those that DICIDE VOLUNTARILY
to escrow keys.  In fact, the escrow agent would be criminally liable
for handing your key over to someone without a court order.  

Your assertion that everyone and his borther has rejected the bill is
simple non-sense.  The VTW and EPIC web pages contain positive, if not
rave reviews of the bill.
