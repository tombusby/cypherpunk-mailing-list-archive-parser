%$#&*!!!  (Not directed at you, Alex!)

It wasn't outgoing posts that I was worried about, so much as my
replies that were being posted to alt.anonymous.messages via
alpha.c2.org rather than being chained to me through e-mail.  I
wonder how much (if any) mail I may have lost.  How long has this
embargo been in effect?

Is there any chance (pretty please) that the obviously non-forged
mail from alpha.c2.org to alt.anonymous.messages, such as that with
"nobody@c2.org" in the From:  line, can be unblocked on a one-time
basis, or have they already been consigned to the bit-bucket?

Between this and the antics of the Co$, this has not been a pleasant
weekend.

All I gotta say is XENU XENU XENU!
