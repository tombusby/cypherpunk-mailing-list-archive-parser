	The actions they claim they will do will, of course, lead to no
results whatsoever in many cases... as it should be. The hotline in question
sounds like a number as opposed to an email address... pity, we could just
bounce all spam to it and ask them to deal with it.

>   LONDON (Sep 23, 1996 3:48 p.m. EDT) - The British government Monday

	Being financed by the industry = if you're going through a British
ISP, you're paying for it whether you like it or not.

>   It will publish a "legality indicator" or rating for each public
>   access area on the Internet known as a Usenet news group. The rating
>   will indicate whether the group normally contains illegal or
>   pornographic material and what kind.
   
>   Internet users can contact the hotline to complain about material
>   received from anyone via an automatic telephone, mail, e-mail or
>   facsimile.
   
>   Safety-Net operators will try to see where the material came from,
>   contact the authors and ask them to remove it. They can ask the
>   relevant service provider to take action and pass details to the
>   British Police National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS).

	As this is an international network, this is completely impossible.

	Usual government doubletalk.... preserving free speech means no
such actions.
