I just recently built a hardware RNG, I just wanted to see what you guys 
think of it, here is how it works:

	Got a geiger counter plugged into the game port
	Weak radioactive source next to it (dont worry wont fry you)
	Use a PRNG string to do create an RC4 S-box
	Cycle through the S-box in a tight loop, each time checking to 
see if the geiger counter got a hit, if it did, record that number in 
the S-box as our first byte, do this 100 times, and we have 100 random 
numbers.

	With my radioactive source and geiger settings, you can grab 100 
random numbers in about 8 seconds, and the S-box will make a complete 
cycle between 1000 and 350,000 times between geiger hits, depending on 
how long between hits.

any thoughts? It seems to work well, no basic stat analysis reveals any 
pattern, and physicists have backed me up on radioactive decay being 
'the great randomizer'.
