There have been no changes to the time and date of the Portland
Cypherpunks meeting.  For those of you who have not seen the 
past notices of the meeting, here are the details:

Place:        The Habit Internet Cafe
              2633 S.E. 21st Av.
              Portland OR 97202
              SE 21st @ Clinton
              (503) 235-5321
              http://www.teleport.com/~habit/
Date:         January 20th, 1995
Time:         5:23pm (Discordian time)

Activities:   There will be a general discussion of assorted
              topics including planned projects of the various
              participants, a PGP key signing, and general
              socializing, among other things.

If you need instructions on how to get to the Habit, send mail
to alano@teleport.com or habit@teleport.com and I will send 
you directions.

It has been requested that cameras not be brought to the meeting
as some who are planning on attending would like to avoid having
their soul captured by the evil magic of the lens.

If you are planning on participating in the key signing (and you
do not have to if you do not want to), please follow these
instructions:

Send a copy of your public key (ascii armored) to
alano@teleport.com.  (This will also help me determine how many
people are planning on attending.) 

I will compile all of the keys into a keyring which will be
handed out on diskette.  (Please tell me the format you want the
disk in.  Nothing too exotic, (like IBM mainframe formats and 
the like) please.)  I can also e-mail the keyring to you as well.

I will hand out a list of the fingerprints of the keys on the
keyring.  At the meeting we will verify key fingerprints. When
you get home, you can then sign the keys at your leisure and 
mail them back to me.  I will then send them to the key servers
and the participants of the keysigning.

***PLEASE DO NOT BRING YOUR PRIVATE KEYRINGS TO THE MEETING***
