The term used is "fractal cypher."  It's not a terribly
significant plot point IMO (although, for longtime fans
of ST:TNG, there is some juicy humor with Data and the
Borg "Queen" when she tries some, er, unconventional
tactics to try to get him to reveal it.)

AFAIK the "fractal cypher" is just a couple of clever
technobabble words thrown together for effect.
