However, see my commentary to Mike Ingle.  If it's a foreign manufacturer 
we're talking about, then even though  the export of the signed package 
might arguably be illegal, ONLY ONE copy of it needs to be exported, 
possibly by some anonymous person who has nothing to do with either company. 
 The export will be illegal, but once exported any recipients would 
presumably be able to do anything they want with the program.
