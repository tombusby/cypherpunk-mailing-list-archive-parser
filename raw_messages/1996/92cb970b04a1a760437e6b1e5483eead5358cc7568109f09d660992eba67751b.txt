The V-Chip is a political kluge, nothing more. It's a useless technology 
that at best will encourage lax parents to further surrender their kids 
to the neon-nanny.

And besides... why rate program just on violence?  Why not "quality" from 
a variety of orgs?  Other content ratings, from various organizations.  
And why limit it to ratings... why not a special subband of broadcast 
used for sending out schedule updates? Subtitles (in other languages, or 
English for foreign films...)? etc.? etc.? Chances are the V-Chip will 
interfere with any such expansions of TV capabilities in the future...

Then again, the heck with TV. I rarely watch it.  I prefer the radio 
myself... at least they didn't require V-Chips for that.  And with the 
Internet "expanding", chances are in a generation or two TV will be a 
dead technology.

Rob.
