I find that interesting, since I can do the same thing with a bank machine.
(Or maybe it is only money laundering when you don't get your picture taken
as part of the process.)

The only problem I see is that charges to a credit card can be withdrawn by
the customer within a certain time period after either the billing or
transaction.  (I do not remember which.  It has been a year or two since I
have been responsible for CC transactions.)  The individual could always say
"It was not me" and get away with the e-cash.  Sounds like a BIG risk for
anyone setting up such a site.

That is the big problem with e-cash as it is...  Not everyone has a major
credit card.  Not everyone is willing to go through the hastles and invasion
of privacy involved to set up an account with an e-cash provider.

When getting e-cash is as easy as getting a money order, then there might be
more interest.
