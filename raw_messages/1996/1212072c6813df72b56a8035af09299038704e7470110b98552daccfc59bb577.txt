What:  A gathering of folks at the National Cryptologic Museum for a day 
      of exploration, education, and general schmoozing.

Who:  Cypherpunks, coderpunks, crypto enthusiasts, computer 
      nerds, crypto liberationists/crypto anarchists, system administrators, 
      political activists, hackers, rug-chewing wannabes, and Digex 
      employees.  Not forgetting Feebs, Case Officers, ATF Agents, and 
      Counter-Intel Specialists.

When:  Saturday, August 10, 1996, 11am

Where:  The National Cryptologic Museum, Ft Meade, MD (just outside 
	Washington DC, about 1/2 hr from Baltimore)

Why:  To give us a chance to catch up on things in a relaxed and 
      stimulating environment, as well as give those who didn't get to
      come along last time a second try.


General Information:

	The National Cryptologic Museum is located on Ft. Meade (NSA 
National Headquarters) and is dedicated to educating the public about the 
history of cryptography.  The majority of the museum's exhibits pertain to 
cryptanalysis during WWII, with special attention given to the Enigma system.
	Immediately following the museum tour, which may take
approximately 1 hour, a talk on Enigma will be given by cryptographer Carl
Ellison (cme@cybercash.com).  The talk will take place in the museum's
conference room.
	Following the lecture, we will be going over to Henckles (10 minutes
from the museum), a local resturaunt reported to be a favorite hangout for
NSA employees.  Henckles has amazing sandwiches as well as good beer on tap.

	Further information on the National Cryptologic museum, as well as a 
pretty good map to the museum can be found on their web site at URL 
http://www.nsa.gov:8080/museum/.

	This year's gathering promises an even greater attendance than
last year's, and we anticipate a great time for everyone.  Please post
this announcement anywhere you feel relevant and invite some friends
along!
