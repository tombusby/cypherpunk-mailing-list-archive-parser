Unless they choose "anarchy" without even knowing it.  As in my Gallup Poll
question to "prove" that 90% of Americans are anarchists:

"Some groups advocate aggressive violence as a means of achieving social
ends.  Do you agree with them?  Do you advocate aggressive violence as a
means of achieving social ends?"

So 90% of the population answer "No" and demonstrate that they are either
anarchists or don't understand the nature of government.

One would hope.  Perhaps reality will have to do it for them.
