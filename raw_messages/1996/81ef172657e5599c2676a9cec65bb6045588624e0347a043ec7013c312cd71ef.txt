Subject: should we use same nym on multiple servers?

  With the additional nym servers coming on the scene comes the 
question of whether or not to "claim" our alpha.c2 nym on the other 
ones, too.  E.g., if we are foobar@alpha.c2.org, should we also become 
foobar@nym.gondolin.org and foobar@nym.alias.net, too?

  That would let us have a very stable nym, and prevent confusion over 
who's "who" if someone else were to have the same id with another nym 
server.  But, it makes it harder to keep our real ID secret.  (E.g., 
an oversimplified scenario would be if an attacker sends a message to 
all three nyms, then watches three PGP conventionally encrypted 
messages arrive in our mailbox.)

  A "safer" way would be to have the other two nyms have a fake 
address, but then we couldn't receive mail with it.  A trickier way 
would be to have the reply block point to alt.anonymous, but then we'd 
have to constantly be watching for a message "to" us.

  Another angle, though, is that the nym servers may be unstable, and 
multiple nyms would allow us to post, if out "favorite" is down.

  Anyways, I'm a beginner, and think that the most useful use of 
remailers is to ask dumb questions.  :-)
