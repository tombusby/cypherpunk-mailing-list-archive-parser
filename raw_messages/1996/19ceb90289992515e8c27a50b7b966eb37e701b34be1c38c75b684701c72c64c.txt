This is, generically, a dispute that the Federal government will eventually 
lose, I think within 10 years or so.  Commonlaw courts were quite real (in 
fact they pre-dated equity courts by at least 2-3 centuries), and they can 
rapidly reconstitute themselves along their original lines. 

There are, I think, two reasons that the equity court system (and their 
sleazy lawyers, both on and off the bench) are worried.  First, what they 
have now is, effectively, a monopoly on "justice."  The re-emergence of 
commonlaw courts would provide competition that has been long gone.  Think 
of it like any monopoly that suddenly has to accept competition.

  The second reason is that with the return of commonlaw courts will be 
eliminated the tradition (and that's all it was, effectively a tradition) of 
judicial immunity.  Imagine how easy it could be to bring criminal charges 
against judges, lawyers, cops, and others who are either "impossible" to sue 
or at least very difficult.
