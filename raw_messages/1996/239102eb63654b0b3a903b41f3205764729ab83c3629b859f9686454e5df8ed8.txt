Dear cypherpunks;

In the last few days I have received numerous email coming from you but with
fake return addresses from messages posted on newsgroups.  I must have been
targeted because I am a bulk emailer.  Letting you know now that I am a
legitimate bulk emailer compiling my list with the permission of each account
holder.

If this barrage of email does not cease immediately, I will be forced to take
legal and maybe not so legal actions to defend myself.

If you would like to discuss this further, please call me at 407-438-8892.

Tim
