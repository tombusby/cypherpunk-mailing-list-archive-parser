	I think this was mentioned a while back. If I recall correctly, a 
business may not refuse cash for a debt already incurred, but may refuse 
to allow you to incur said debt. That is, while cash is legal tender, a 
business may still refuse it, on the principle that they may not be 
compelled to provide service to any person or class of persons. In this 
case, class of persons == those w/cash. 

So, no, if you already had a contract or obligation, they may not refuse 
payment in cash. They may try. However, walking up to a store counter or 
a FedEx depot is a different matter. One only has to wonder about 
restaurants which want to refuse cash...do you pay before eating, then? 
Ask for proof of credit before opening service? 

So far as I think...
