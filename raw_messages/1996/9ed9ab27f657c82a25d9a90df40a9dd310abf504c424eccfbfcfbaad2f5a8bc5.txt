Perhaps you've forgotten double-taxation.  When a company makes a profit, it 
is taxed at the full corporate tax rate.  Paid to a stockholder, it is AGAIN 
taxed at the citizen's rate.  It's a ripoff, and the strange thing is a lot 
of citizen-dolts don't understand this or understand its implications.

It would be fairer to tax either once the corporation, or the individual, 
but not both.  Now, capital gains is merely the effect of increased value 
that hasn't yet been paid in dividend.  It would make sense, therefore, to 
simply not tax "income from selling stock" since the taxes have already been 
paid.
