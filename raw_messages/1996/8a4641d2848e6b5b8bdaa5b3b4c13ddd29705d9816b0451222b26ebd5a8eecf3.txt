I'd appreciate it if someone could critique these papers for me, probably
off the list. 

[Note that 198.105.232.5 is just one of the IP addresses being 
load-balanced by www.microsoft.com. The servers seem to crash a lot with 
the current Gibraltar beta, so if one IP address doesn't work (like .5 
isn't responding to pings right now), try another and it will work.]

You believe everything MS tells you?! How naive.

Otay, let me see. The server is protected if you aren't hooked up to a
network. That implies *nothing* about the fact when a network is plugged
into it. If I'm sitting at the console and have to enter a password to
do things, doesn't mean I have to enter one from the network when I
mount the entire disk. (Even if that is not the true case.)

There are orange, red and blue books. This is all well pointed out on:

http://www.windows.microsoft.com/TechNet/boes/bo/winntas/technote/security.htm

What has Microsoft actually passed? I had heard it was only Orange book
C2 and not Red book C2.

Micrsoft also points it out on:
