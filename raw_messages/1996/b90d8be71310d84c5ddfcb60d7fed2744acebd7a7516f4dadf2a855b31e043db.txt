This is an enormously important point to make. Rich put the files online
via AFS, which is where I got them, supplemented by some taken directly
from the Z-site. We did *not* do it at the request of the Zundelfolken.

I've updated the censorship.html file at my mirror to reflect the
nuances of the situation.

BTW, Sameer has mirrored, and someone in Japan likely will too.
