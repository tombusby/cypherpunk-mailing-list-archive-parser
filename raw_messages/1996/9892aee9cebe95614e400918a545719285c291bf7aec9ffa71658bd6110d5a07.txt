Cypherpunks-announce@toad.com has one or two postings a month,
mainly Bay Area cypherpunks meetings.  cypherpunks-announce-request for info.

You can read cypherpunks with a newsreader at nntp.hks.net ;
use all your favorite newsreading tools to filter and organize it.

You can get 5-10% of the volume from filtered lists from Ray Arachelian 
or Eric Blossom.  (Ray's FCPUNX list is at either sunder@dorsai.org or
sunder@brainlink.com if he's moved it.  Send mail with Subject: help fcpunx 
There's a digested form of the list.  It's free.
Eric's at eb@comsec.com ; cypherpunks-light costs @20/year.)

Coderpunks@toad.com is a lower-volume code-related-discussion-only list.
Send mail to coderpunks-request@toad.com for help.
