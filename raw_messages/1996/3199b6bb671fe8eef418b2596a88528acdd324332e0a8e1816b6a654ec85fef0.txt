However, it won't really matter, will it?  Unless a person is REALLY 
atypical, nearly all the people he'd want to see dead are similarly hated by 
thousands or millions of others, or they are in classes of people who are 
hated by millions for what they do. (criminals, cops, politicians, and 
despots both domestic and foreign etc.)  That being the case, you personally 
would probably never have to donate anything; you're pretty well assured 
that other people will do this "work" for you.  This is as it should be, I 
suppose.

Furthermore, most of your potential targets (were you to want to name them) 
would probably be fully aware of their vulnerability, and would resign or 
run away or start behaving in hopes of surviving.  

All this is why I think that the status quo might collapse rather suddenly, 
as in Eastern Europe 1989, where in the span of a couple weeks the 
governments fell comparatively bloodlessly.
