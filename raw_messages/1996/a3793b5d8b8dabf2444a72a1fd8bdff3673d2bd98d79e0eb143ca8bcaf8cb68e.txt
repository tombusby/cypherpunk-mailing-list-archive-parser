Clearly, one of the purposes of the show "Cops" is to intimidate.  Even
though the police have total editorial control they often show thuggish
and perhaps illegal behavior.  (though they also sometimes show cops 
displaying hard to believe forbearance)

Since the show is, in part, intimidatory, it seems reasonable to suppose
that the cops are the bad boys who are going to come for you.
