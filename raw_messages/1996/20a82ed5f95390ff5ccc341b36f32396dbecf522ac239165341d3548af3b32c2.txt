I have 3 Macs in the house.  The places I work have rooms full of machines.

I thought your model was cheap processors and expensive software.  I.e.,.
The cost of the software is greater than the cost of the hardware.  Sounds
like more than just "a little more".

Again, there is a complex infrastructure which offers the customer no
obvious benefit.  I disagree that copy protection would have been widely
accepted, even had it worked smoothly.  In fact, this scheme can be
characterized as a scheme to make copy protection work.

(Slightly tangentially, when my wife was in China at the Women's Conference
NGO meeting, someone walked off with a collection of copy protection
dongles as souvenirs.  The people who wanted to use the software were SOL.)
