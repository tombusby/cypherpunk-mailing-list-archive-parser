If there is any doubt that we _need_ a system to rid us of these sleazy 
politicians: I just saw tonight's PBS McNeil news hour, and they had two 
politicians on, one of which was promoting a re-emergence of the "Star Wars" 
missile defense system, which even under optimistic scenarios would cost 
hundreds of billions of dollars.

My solution is simpler and far less expensive: Target any political or 
military person at any level who is directly or indirectly in control of any 
offensive missile system (nuclear or otherwise), killing off as many as it 
takes until they cry "uncle" and destroy all of that hardware.  Probable 
cost of this persuasian?  A few hundred million dollars, at most.

Who is committing the crime, here?  Maybe, someday, you'll start really 
LISTENING to what I have to say.

ObCrypto?  Your motivations are quite opaque.  Maybe we can turn them into a 
cryptosystem?
