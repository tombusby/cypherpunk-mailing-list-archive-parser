True, and reasonable.

Suppose, though, that the Cypherpunks list was encrypted in this way.
There are about a thousand listmembers.  Using one IDEA key and the
multiple-recipients option would mean that the encrypted message would
consist of a thousand RSA-encrypted session keys followed by the
IDEA-encrypted cyphertext.  If everyone used a 1024-bit-or-longer key
pair, then each message would be a megabyte long!

( (m**P) mod n is going to be log2(n) bits long, right?)

BTW, it was pointed out to me in private email that while vanilla RSA
commutes, the PKCS-compliant RSA in PGP which pads the session key with
random data does not, so that my nifty trick to never expose cleartext
in the list processor wouldn't work.  That's why I'm just a loudmouth
blowhard and not a real cryptographer. ;-)
