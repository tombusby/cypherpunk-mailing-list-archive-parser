Grandly ignoring the 5th amendment, I see?!?  I don't see any contradiction: 
 We can look to the Constitution, simultaneously, for rights for ourselves 
AND for restrictions on government.

Now _THAT'S_ a very valid point.  Unicorn totally ignored that issue.  I 
pointed out my expectation that the only reason wiretaps are secret is their 
technical ability to do them while staying secret.

I've occasionally pointed out that if tomorrow, scientists discover some 
sort of teleport system that allows cops to sneak through walls, at the same 
time being invisible, cops and judges will suddenly announce that the 
requirement that people searched need to be informed of that search is, uh, 
no longer applicable.

This is a problem.  No, not the precise hypothetical I imagined above; I 
don't think it's going to be possible as stated for a long time and probably 
never.  The problem, however, is that "the authorities" have respect for the 
rights of the citizens more in the breach than in the observance, and if 
they find what they consider to be a good reason to ignore them, they will 
with little hesitation.

It's particularly pointless that some of these lawyers keep saying things 
like, "You don't understand how the law works!" when it is quite obvious 
that in most cases, the people who are complaining DO know enough about how 
the law works to identify when it is being abused.  This is not surprising:  
For example, I can't ice-skate worth beans, but I easily tell the difference 
between a bad and a good ice-skater.  I can't make music, but I can tell the 
difference between bad and good music.  I don't know much about 
architecture, but if I see a building collapse I can see that somebody made 
a mistake.  I don't act, but I can tell the different between a good and bad 
actor.

It is a frequent conceit among "experts" that the only people who should be 
able to criticize them are people who know as much as they do on a 
particular subject.  Black Unicorn is particularly bad in this regard.

Probably mostly because they expect that the government is going to be 
completely unwilling to admit that it's wrong.  In fact, of course, that's 
exactly why the government is very much afraid of the advent of good encryption:  
Ubiquitous crypto telephones make the government's use of wiretapping 
irrelevant, totally without regard to what any cop or judge or prosecutor 
says.  Fundamentally, it's a technical fix to a legal mistake.
