Actually, no.  AP "stacks the deck" dramatically against those few who 
engage in war crimes.  People from all sides of a dispute who object to them 
can donate, and anybody considering participating in war crimes has to keep 
this absolutely secret.

How long do you think that such groups would last with AP functional?  
Consider all those bleeding-hearts who are going to be voting for Clinton 
this year.  I expect that many of them would gladly donate money to see 
organizations like the KKK dead.    How effective will these 
hate-organizations be if they're running for their lives?

Many if not most philosophers disagree.  My _opinion_ of my rights exists, 
and for the vast majority of the  people that's quite enough to remind them 
to steer clear.

Since "they live there" and "we live here" there doesn't have to be any 
contradiction in this.

AP is not dependant on any sort of "natural law" argument.  It doesn't 
really matter where you got the opinion of your rights that you have.  
"Natural law," or "gift of God," or anything else.  Most of the time things 
will work out just fine.  True, if you start believing that you have a right 
to a dozen free doughnuts per day from the shop down the street, and the 
owner of that shop disagrees, there may be a dispute.  However, I suggest 
that disputes of this kind will be rare and short-lived, for reasons which 
should be obvious: You may have wanted a dozen doughnuts, but you'll end up 
with a dozen holes!

It's odd that you would say this.  Most societies operate today against 
crime by putting people in jails, which would (absent a crime to justify 
this) be a violation of THEIR rights.  

As for whether this is "disproportionate"...   Let's see, a person can 
easily get a few years in jail for doing a bank robbery where he gets a 
thousand dollars or so.  Yet, there were a number of bankers in the 1980's 
in the US who got no greater sentences for stealing tens or even hundreds of 
millions of dollars.  You find the "proportionality" in this and send me a 
note.

My solution is to allow the victims of a crime to purchase the punishment of 
the criminal, which I claim will be a fair fairer solution, and one that 
will accomplish far more deterrence than the status quo.

Some of us seem to disagree.
