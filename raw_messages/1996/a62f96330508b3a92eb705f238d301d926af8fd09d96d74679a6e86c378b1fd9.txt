Whew! They are wide open for arbitrage! Suppose that at Ladbroke I sell
an obligation to pay $6 if Dole wins (they are apparently valuing it for
this much), collecting $1. At the same time, to hedge my exposure, I go
to "William Hill", and purchase their obligation to pay _me_ $10 if Bob
Dole wins, paying the $1 bill that I just got at Ladbroke's.

If bob dole loses, I lose nothing. If he wins, I make $4 out of air.

I wonder why the beting markets are so imperfect.


have fun
