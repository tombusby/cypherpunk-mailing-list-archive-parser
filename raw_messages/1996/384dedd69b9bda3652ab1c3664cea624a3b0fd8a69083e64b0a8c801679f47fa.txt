A helpful cypherpunk provided a list of addresses for various postmaster
and root accounts in cyberpromo.com.  I am now sending my abuse response
to

wallace@cyberpromo.com
cyberpr@ANSWERME.COM
root@savetrees.com
postmaster@savetrees.com
root@answerme.com
postmaster@answerme.com
root@NS3.CYBERPROMO.COM
root@NS4.CYBERPROMO.COM
postmaster@NS3.CYBERPROMO.COM
postmaster@NS4.CYBERPROMO.COM

and it's actually generating responses.  So far, Sanford Wallace has
missed my point several times, assumed that I have been sending mail to
the replybot when I have repeatedly stated the reverse, admitted that
"someone is spoofing requests from your domain" and threatened to bill
$1000 for "reviewing frivolous bills".  It appears I at least have his
attention.

This is only slightly related to the list (via the redirection of the
list to Wallace's replybot).  If anyone wants to discuss CyberPromo
tactics further, please do it via private mail.  If enough of us want to
talk about it, I'll set up a little list for the purpose.
