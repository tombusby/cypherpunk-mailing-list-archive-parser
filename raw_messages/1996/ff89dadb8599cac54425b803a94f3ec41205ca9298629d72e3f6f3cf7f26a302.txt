Not to unduly belabor this, but I quite recently discovered another,
somewhat less widely known book on the subject.  _Approaching
Zero_ by Paul Mungo & Bryan Clough.  I've only skimmed it, but
my 11 year-old son has promised to lend it to me when he finishes
reading it.

"In the end, more than they wanted freedom, they wanted
security.  When the Athenians finally wanted not to give to
society but for society to give to them, when the freedom
they wished for was freedom from responsibility, then Athens
ceased to be free."  - Edward Gibbon
