So you mean rather than merely, or only, complaining that things have
not, or are not, working right (in our favor, to our benefit), because
of what Evil Old Men have done to the system as it now operates, the
discussion should go in the direction of:

.  "doing something about it", or 

.  ideas on methods and techniques which would work, which could

.  make a difference (potentially, hopefully) towards the success of
techie systems which would result in greater personal, individual
control, 

also including perhaps:

.  clarifications on why, in spite of the resistance of those who are
apprehensive about the break-down of law&order, these are a "good thing"
to promote and implement (for those who don't "get it"),

.  aiming more at postive improvements and successes in the future,
rather than focusing too much on past mistakes, failures, injustices
(where the reader could wonder, "so how does this relate").

...or something like that.
