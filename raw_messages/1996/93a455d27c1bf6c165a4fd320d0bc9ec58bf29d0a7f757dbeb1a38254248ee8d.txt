Yes.  I was just trying to point out that as long as they are going to do
something, it's refreshing to see that they do it right.  Whether they should
be doing it at all is an entirely different matter and I have little doubt

major reforms.

Still, government incompetency is rather frustrating and helps inspire
cynicism.s
