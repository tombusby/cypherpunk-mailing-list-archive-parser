Potential, but you can manage risk with things like dead drops from
trusted parties to forwarding agents to offshore drops to....

Realization means that their is a changing of hands or of forms of assets.
Income tax and taxes on currency now are dependent on such transactions.
Someone already noted the problems with just taxing possession on a given
date of e.g., inventory.  To tax efficiently you have to tax an event of
transfer.

I'm not going to spend hours typing in all the kinds of realization the
U.S. system employs.

No.  The tax is a tax on Capital _Gains_.  Even this is not taxed until
the gain is "realized" (the stock sold or exchanged.. etc.)  There is an
exception for Personal Holding Companies, or Subpart F income for example,
but that's only to the extent there has still been a gain.

If you taxed currency based merely on possession, then do you just tax
on the first of every year?  That makes it so that if I have $10,000 under
my bed, I pay tax on it one year, then I pay tax on it again the next
year.  Boy, talk about an incentive not to save.  There goes the banking
industry.

Relax, I wasn't calling you a murderer, I was pointing out, a second time,
that in anonymous corporations there was no one to kill.  "Who are you
going to put pools on?"

Give me context.  It's possible to kill the president too.  That doesn't
mean it will become the basis of government.

That's that anonymous transactions are for.

I forwarded two large segments of the work to the list, yes.  If you,
or anyone else on the list, would like copies, let me know.
