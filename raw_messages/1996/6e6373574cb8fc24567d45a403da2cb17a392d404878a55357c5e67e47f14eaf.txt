I'd be interested in seeing your numbers and cost breakdowns.  I'd really be
interested in the up-front costs that would be associated with the equipment
and set-up time/training that will help "insure" data privacy over wideley
broadcast media.  The up-front costs for ~T1 capable tranceivers isn't
insignificant either.  I figure ~$10K up front (maybe half of that, maybe twice
when you include management overhead)  Amortize  over 3 years, and compare.

All of this is assuming that the bandwidth is available on the airwaves to
handle ~200 ~T1s.  (If we're talking $200.00/mo. for T1, sign me up tomorrow,
and my neighbor, and his, and hers, and...  *poof* no more bandwidth in a
"decently" populated metro area or even a downtown.  (Back of the envelope
calculations show that ~200 T1 ~= 1 TV station [although I might be off by an
order of magnitude.])

I apologize if this is off topic, but the crypto part still applies (moreso,
even!) to broadcast over the airwaves.  (Besides, I'm sure that this list has
enough subscribers that are shelling out $200-$500/mo. for 56K/Frac T1/ISDN
that they'd be interested in a less expensive alternative.)
