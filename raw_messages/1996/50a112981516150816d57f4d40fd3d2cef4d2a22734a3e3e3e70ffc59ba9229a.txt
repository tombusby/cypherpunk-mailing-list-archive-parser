The Feds consider crypto as munitions so I guess you could ask that same
question as:
      I sold a bunch of Stinger missiles to a man with an American sounding
     name, "Smith."  How was I to know he was __________[bad guys]?

I bet they would prosecute you for the missiles so I'd suspect they would
on the crypto too.

Me?  A lawyer?  HAHAHAHAHAHhahahahhaaa Yeah, right!
