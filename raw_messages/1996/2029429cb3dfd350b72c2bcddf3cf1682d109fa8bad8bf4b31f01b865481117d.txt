Only that this is pretty real, while "HERF guns" have only appeared
in science fiction novels, and in newspaper articles which seem
to be from the 'Weekly World News' school of journalism.

Go over the the amateur radio newsgroups, and you'll find that the
interference of mobile ham radios with car ignitions is a well
known issue.

On a more speculative note,  many years ago Harlan Ellison
wrote an anti-statist short story entitled '"Repent Harlequin!"
cried the Tick-Tock Man.' , in which the government required
all adults to be surgically fitted with 'cardioplates', which 
allowed the state to turn off the hearts of  uncooperative
citizen-units by radio.
