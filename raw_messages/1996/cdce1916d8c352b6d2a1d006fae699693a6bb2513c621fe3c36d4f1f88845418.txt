That which is broadcast is certainly speech.

Trying to draw some kind of "right to be broadcast" as a result is
stupidity or ignorance, or both.

Anyone has the right to, e.g., start a mailing list, or a newsletter.
No one has the right to compell ABC or FOX or John Gilmore or anyone
else to broadcast their speech.  (The rarest exceptions, like equal time
rules, exist in election contexts).

Learn the difference.  Go to law school before you argue free speech
concepts in any detail.  Most importantly, spend more time thinking, less
talking or typing.
