God I hope you keep talking like this.  The list might not have to endure 
you anymore unless you get a cushy prison cell with internet hookups.

I wouldn't call fines imposed on a third party who clearly was complicit 
in the destruction of material evidence to a proceeding "abuse."

It's abuse because you can't get away with your little scheme?  Eh?

Mr. Bell can't commit his crime with impunity, so the justice system is a 
sham?

Sure, several.  See my large note on the subject of asset protection.

Mr. Bell, go make yourself a sovereign or something.

My hostility is for a system that allows mob mentality and murder run the 
streets like a bad day in Beruit.

Again, I don't consider fines assessed to deal with obviously complicit 
third parties to be abuse.  Your problem is you can't deal with 
authority without calling for murder.  Become an expatriate if you don't 
like the U.S.  Move to e.g., East Turkey.

Actually I should have said "material."

Suicide is always an option.

I don't much like the system in the United States either.  But there are 
two ways around it.  Ways that work, and ways that don't.

Encouraging random murder and mob justice is, in my view, in the second 
field.
