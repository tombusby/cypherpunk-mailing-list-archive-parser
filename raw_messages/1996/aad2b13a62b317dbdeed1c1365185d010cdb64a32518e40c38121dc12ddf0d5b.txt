You can add me to your list.  I keep an "unemployability list" - although I
don't write it down or put it on a computer.

Why don't you come back to reality.  I have hired and fired people.  Those
that I fired I would not hire again.  There are others I have worked with
that I would never hire (and would strongly recommend against anyone else
hiring).  That is life.  I have little sympathy for the "unfortunate" people
that I may hurt by not recommending their employment.  Generally it is
because they are lazy, stupid, or dishonest.  This is a judgement call on my
part, and others are free to take or discard my recommendations based on my
reputation.  

Here is my recommendation for you.  Take my "unemployables" list.  Hire
everyone on it.  Try to run a business without going broke.

Hiring people based on reputation is a system that works.  I'm sorry if this
impinges on your sensibilities.  Reality has a tendency to do that though.
