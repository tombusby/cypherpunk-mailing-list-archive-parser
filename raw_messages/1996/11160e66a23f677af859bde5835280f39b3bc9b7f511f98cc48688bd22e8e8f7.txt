I predict that the "Access requires two master key agents" feature that
Clipper I pretended to have* gets lost along the way.  It wasn't in
Steve Walker's software key-gakking system that he and Dorothy were
touting a year or so ago, and it's a bit of work to actually implement
in software depending on the encryption methods used.

[* The Clipper I chip didn't actually implement dual GAK agents,
though it could have without much extra effort; that was all part
of the process of loading the chip's master-key in the vault charade,
and could therefore be easily changed later... ]
