The second paragraph of this post seems to address a different issue than
the first. The problem of correlations between a certain sender sending and
a certain receiver receiving, is well known and understood. The best
defense against this (as a sender) is to send messages into the remailer
network with a period equal to or less than the the time required for a
message with your typical chain length to pass through the remailer net. If
these are sent at random intervals, then your real mail will blend with the
cover traffic, and mail from you will correlate with all message receipts
by all message recipients.

The second paragraph seems to deal with the issue of being known as an
anonymous remailer or regular remailer user. I am not sure exactly what the
concern with that is.
