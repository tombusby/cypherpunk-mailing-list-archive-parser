This is a particularly fascinating reaction, Jamie.  As I see it, we
have implemented every part of the attack that we can implement without
doing anything that is either unethical or illegal.  Is it your position
that no systematic flaw in your security is real until someone has
actually broken it?  

Actually, that position would in fact be quite consistent with your
company's earlier implicit assertion that 40-bit encryption was
sufficient (for international consumers) until somebody actually broke
it, even though everyone who understood cryptography already knew
otherwise.

Nearly everyone with a computer has either been infected with a virus or
knows somebody who has.

There has never been a serious financial incentive for virus writers in
the past, so they haven't ever been, for example, bankrolled by
organized crime.  They've been written by sociopathic hobbyists in the
past.  Your commerce mechanism gives them an incentive to turn pro.

The average sophistication of Internet users is dropping every day, as
the net continues to explode, and the ease of spreading malicious
software is going up accordingly.

Having said all that, I do agree with you 100% that the hardest part of
the devastating, automated attack that we have outlined is in fact the
infection vector.  You are absolutely right about that.  What we have
shown is that the HARDEST part of stealing an unbounded number of credit
cards transmitted using your company's preferred commerce mechanism is,
in fact, the deployment of a virus or Trojan Horse.  Unfortunately, as
most personal computer users have long since realized, that just isn't
that uncommon or hard to do.

I suspect that the world's financial institutions will, by and large, be
grateful that First Virtual doesn't share your belief that one has to
wait for a criminal to break a system to be convinced that it is
insecure. 

Show me an automated way to break the postal system in a large-scale way
without getting caught, and then I'll be worried about it, too.

Ooh, good point.  We could probably use MS Word macros as the infection
vector for our program.  I like that idea.  I'll add it to our list of
potential ways this program could spread itself.

However, the entire contents of your hard disk aren't of direct economic
value.  They're also hard to digest, and they're big enough to be likely
to be noticed in transit (e.g. they can easily fill up mail spools if
you mail 'em out).  I'd much rather sift through your hard disk looking
for credit card numbers, and then spirit them quietly off your machine. 
But I'd also install a keystroke sniffer if I suspected the user might
be using your preferred mechanism to send out his credit card number.

Hey, you're a smart guy.  That probably means your machine is relatively
hard to infect.  A criminal would skip you and instead target the
millions of consumers who were more easily infected.  I didn't describe
a scheme that could target one individual's credit card.  I described a
scheme that could steal millions of them indiscriminately.

The "trust us, we're experts" approach to security is only as good as
the experts you trust, as you've just amply demonstrated.  For my part,
I'm happy to let the bankers hire independent experts study the attack
we've outlined and reach their own conclusions.  -- Nathaniel
