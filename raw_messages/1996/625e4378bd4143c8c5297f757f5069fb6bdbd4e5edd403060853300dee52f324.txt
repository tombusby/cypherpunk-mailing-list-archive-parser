That's a judgement, rather than an obvious truth.  Fact is, service in
Washington is purely voluntary, and one can leave anytime they wish.

Sounds pretty casual, doesn't it?  Maybe there are a *few* c-punks who
fit that description, but there are at least as many who are in this
thing for some heavy action, if you know what I mean, and I think you do.

When I "joined" the Audio Engineering Society in the late 1970's, to get
their journal cheap, it was going pretty good.  Eventually it decayed
quite a bit, where they were running more pictures of their get-togethers
and awards programs than anything else.  I see cypherpunks in the same
straits potentially, as long as so many of the long-term "members" can
continue claiming that "It belongs to one person, really, our Cypherpunks
God", etc.  Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of potential here, and I
hope it continues, but....  BTW, thanks for a very civil reply.
