Well, I agree that I was "shooting from the hip" on my statement that the 
government doesn't prohibit informing the victim (and yes, such people are 
indeed properly called "victims") that a report was made (see below).  
Imagine that, Jim Bell OVERestimating the ethics of the government!  That'll 
teach me a lesson.

Notice that they don't define what would constitute an "attempt to cause a 
domestic financial institution to fail to file a report..."  Since from the 
story told, it is obvious that there is no hard-and-fast rule on reporting, 
it should be equally obvious that there is no sure-fire way to prevent a 
report.  As such, equally so, there is no object way to tell (other than, 
say, a direct statement by somebody) that a person's actions were intended 
to avoid a report.

Given that the 1st amendment to the US Constitution supposedly is intended 
to guarantee freedom of speech, any prior restraint on speech must be 
presumed to be unconstitutional unless proved to be constitutional.  Since 
under the circumstances described there is no known crime or ongoing 
investigation, such a prohibition on speech doesn't even rise to the level 
of hypothetical "obstruction of justice" which is occasionally brought up as 
a phony justification for such bans.
