	I'm not sure if the major use for ratings may not be searching for
material that the raters don't like. I'd be interested in many things the
fundys don't like, for instance. One could even do this via one of the
"services" that mails out listings of places to be locked from kids - just
sign up one of your anonymous employees, and get the data and put it on your
anonymous web access site. Doing so - if you don't admit you've done it - may
be cheaper than doing the research yourself. Of course, you'll need to check
out each such site to make sure that it isn't a decoy that they've inserted.
