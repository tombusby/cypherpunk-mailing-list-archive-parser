Read what I said carefully please.  I said the assumption that they are
for free is arrogance.  Perhaps your services are worth less, that's
not really my concern.  They may have a wonderful product, but expecting
and taking for granted free review by the entire list is still arrogance.

Uh, no.

Assume a Scoobie Doo Mystery Machine Van is free with your one cent
donation to Burger King, or $1.49 with no donation.

Query:  How much is a Scoobie Doo Mystery Machine Van worth?

Query 2:  How much has Burger King "lost" if you donate a cent and take
the van?

Replace "one cent donation to Burger King" with "opportunity cost of
reviewing and writing a review of the software."

Replace "Scoobie Doo Mystery Machine Van" with "copy of crypto product."

Determine the cost of producing one software package.
Subtract the opportunity cost of the reviewer from software package.
production cost (or market cost if you prefer).

Now, revist your statement above.

Uh, perhaps you better direct your keen and unblurred accounting acumen
inward.

The relevance of "market value" in the above paragraph is left as an
exercise for the reader, as is the nature of the term "valuable software."

Ok, and how much did it cost you in opportunity cost to write a few kiss
ass paragraphs about the software?  (Hint, it's almost certainly less than
$99, and if not, the crypto company is taking you for a ride).

And thousands in this country have bought pet rocks.  So?

Thankfully, I am not your pal.

I don't care if it is real or if it is not.  The point is that certain
marketing and review tactics make a crypto product, regardless of its
merit, look like a pile of dung.  Offering free copies to write reviews
where that offer contains phrases like "a $99 value) is one such tactic.

A little dissention upsetting for you?  If you don't like it, get off the
list.

I'm not sure why my comments are so clearly, to you, a value judgement
about Pronto Secure itself.  My comments were directed toward their
marketing efforts and tactics.  I have since come to believe that the
marketing department there has got it on the money now, and understands
the way those kind of offers go over with some individuals on the list.  I
suggest you consider reviewing my original message.  Looks to me like you
just replied to a reply to a reply.
