The fuck it ain't.  They are at least two newsgroups out there
that carry every piece of e-mail that goes to the cypherpunks list.

This may be true, up until now, but the faggots are now getting
kicked off of the new UseNet.  There are just TOO MANY faggots
like Peter Berger and Tim May and John Gilmore runnung around
to allow this faggot subculture to continue.

These faggot cypherpunks are not worth wasting your time on,
unless you are ready to take their fucking ass to court and
cross-examine them.

ARE YOU A FAGGOT, Peter Berger? -- ANSWER THE QUESTION !!!

(The faggots must answer this question when you get them on the
stand.)

That Tim Skirvin is also a faggot, so I have been told by
his schoolmates.  Has he been fucked in the ass by anybody
on this list?
