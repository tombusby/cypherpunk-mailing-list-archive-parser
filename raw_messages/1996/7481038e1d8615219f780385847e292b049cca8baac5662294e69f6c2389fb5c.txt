The above statement is false. You have to agree to the license for the
beta, and the release will likely have the same terms as before--you have
to buy it unless
you're a US student or some such. Netscape is NOT "giving it away". Even
the no-charge users are licensed under carefully crafted terms. And as the
copyright owner, they, not you decide on redistribution policy even for
cases where it is a no-charge copy.

So it IS stealing to redistribute without permission--it is THEIR
intellectual property and only they may decide on what terms others may
have a copy.

And yes, I'm a licensed user and paid for mine.
