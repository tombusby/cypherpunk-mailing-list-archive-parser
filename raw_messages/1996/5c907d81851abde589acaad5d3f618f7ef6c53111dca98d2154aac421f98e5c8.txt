This is the wordlist for Diceware, and I quote, "7776 short English words,
abbreviations and easy to remember character strings. The average length of
each word is about 4.2 characters. The biggest words are six characters long.

The list is based a longer word list posted to the Internet news group
sci.crypt by Peter Kwangjun Suk."

This may not be long enough for your needs.

Good luck.
