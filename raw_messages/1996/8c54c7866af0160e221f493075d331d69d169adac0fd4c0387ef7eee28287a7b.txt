This is overly pessimistic.  Java primitive data types are fully
specified and Java operators are well-defined in the sense that
their results are unambiguous with specified input.  One
certainly does not have situations as one has in C, where things
like "int" or what happens to the sign bit on certain shifts is
left up to the implementor's discretion.  Even the typical "side
effects" tricks with passed parameters should be impossible with
Java programs.

While it is true that formal meta-language descriptions of Java
semantics and the universe of Java types are not currently
provided for the language, and the traditional kinds of formal
correctness proofs haven't been published, the language is
sufficiently simple and restricted to make it unlikely that major
loopholes will be discovered in this area.  I would be truly
surprised, for instance, if instruction sequences which
unbalanced the stack, wrote out of bounds, or accessed memory
locations as inconsistant types, were discovered to slip past a
bytecode verifier correctly implemented according to Sun's
recommendations.

Saying that the current specification does not support formal
proofs of correctness is far different than saying that the
language itself is broken.

Again, he is not saying that the type verifier isn't correct,
merely that the materials with which to construct a proof have
not yet been dumped on top of his desk.

Not certain, but very very likely.  Due to the restricted nature
of Java and the bytecode, the checks that need to be done are
fairly simple transitive closures of relations involving local
program structure.  While the general theory of object-oriented
runtime structures can get hairy, Java's elimination of things
like multiple inheritance makes its own corner of this universe
considerably more tractable.

This summary might be a bit more impressive if the author had
included a bytecode fragment or two as a concrete example of
where such changes were necessitated.

I think Java, as currently specified, is going to be around for
quite a while.  I further think that the concerns expressed above
will be addressed by augmentation of the existing specifications
and by construction of the necessary proofs of correctness, and
not by drastic surgery on the language and virtual machine as
they currently exist.

In any case, the anarchy of the free market rarely takes notice
of the theoretical musings of academicians.  Until Java
experiences a catastrophic and public train wreck, people will
continue to use it and its reputation will continue to grow.
