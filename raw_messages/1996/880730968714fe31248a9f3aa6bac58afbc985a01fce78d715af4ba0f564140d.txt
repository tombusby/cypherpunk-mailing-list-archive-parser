I have long used this principle. All discussions have to end at some point,
and I have no problems with others having "the last word." If they think
that by having the last word, or by my non-response to their points, that
they have "won," or that I am speechless before their eloquence, then of
course they were not worth arguing with in the first place. No point in
arguing with the preterite. (My neo-Calvinist stoicism showing.)

Recall the recent absurdity of one of our list members repeatedly saying "I
see that Joe Blow has still not responded to my arguments, so I guess he
has conceded defeat! Hee Hee." The more likely explanation is that his
opponent simply realized what he was dealing with.
