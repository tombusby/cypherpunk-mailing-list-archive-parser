Subpoenas *are* widely used in white collar criminal investigations.  
Despite what many of you no doubt believe, investigators and prosecutors 
generally opt for the least intrusive method of getting the information 
needed for the investigation.  Certainly, third parties' records are 
generally subpoenaed rather than seized (absent some articulable reason to 
believe that the records will be altered or destroyed ...).  Even 
companies under investigation are frequently served with subpoenas, not 
warrants, as they usually try to appear to be cooperative while deciding 
which underling to throw to the wolves.
