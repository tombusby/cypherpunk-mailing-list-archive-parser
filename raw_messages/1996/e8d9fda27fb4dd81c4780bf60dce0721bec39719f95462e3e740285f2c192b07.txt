>I'm a bit suprised this hasn't turned up yet on Cypherpunks.  A couple

>Spafford at COAST about an exploitable flaw they've found in Kerberos,
>and then a comment on the www-security list that it is due to a bad
>random number generator. Same old story!

>The message (lifted from the COAST web site)
>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
>
>Personnel at the COAST Laboratory (Computer Operations, Audit, and
>Security Technology) at Purdue University have discovered a
>vulnerability in current versions of the Kerberos security system.
>Graduate students Steve Lodin and Bryn Dole, working with Professor
>Eugene Spafford, have discovered a method whereby someone without
>privileged access to most implementations of a Kerberos 4 server can
>nonetheless break secret session keys issued to users.  This means that
>it is possible to gain unauthorized access to distributed services
>available to a user without knowing that user's password. This method
>has been demonstrated to work in under 1 minute, on average, using a
>typical workstation, and sometimes as quickly as 1/5 second.
>
>The Kerberos system was developed at MIT in the mid-1980s, and has
>been widely adopted for security in distributed systems worldwide.
>Kerberos is most often used on UNIX platforms by various vendors, and
>is often enhanced, sold and supported by 3rd-party vendors for use in
>academic, government, and commercial environments.
>
>The same researchers at COAST have also found a small, theoretical
>weakness in Kerberos version 5 that would allow similar access, given
>some additional information and considerable preliminary computation.
>Kerberos version 5 does not exhibit the same weakness as described
>above for Kerberos version 4.
>
>The researchers at COAST had intended to release the specific details
>of the problem to affected vendors and incident response teams during
>the week of February 19, prior to making a public announcement of
>their findings.  However, as rumors have begun to circulate and
>several representatives of the news media have apparently received
>indication of the problem, we are releasing this preliminary
>announcement at this time.
>
>Government and industry sponsors of the COAST Laboratory were made
>aware of the preliminary details of these findings in January (full
>sponsors receive early notification of significant discoveries as a
>result of COAST research).  Other affiliates of COAST as well as the
>world-wide network of FIRST computer incident response teams were made
>aware of the general nature of the findings during the week of
>February 5.  The original plan at COAST was to release specific
>details only to FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams)
>teams and to MIT prior to announcement by affected vendors of a fix
>for these weaknesses.  The flaw in Kerberos version 4 is significant
>enough that disclosure of its details prior to a fix would allow
>someone with moderate programming skills to exploit it; there is
>currently no reason to believe that others know the details of the
>flaw and are exploiting it, so there is no immediate danger to the
>public that would warrant release of the details at this time.
>
>COAST personnel have been informed that MIT has already developed a
>fix for the flaw in version 4 Kerberos and is preparing it for
>release.  Additionally, COAST researchers are cooperating with MIT
>personnel to identify what (if any) fixes are necessary for version 5
>Kerberos. Users of either version of Kerberos should contact their
>vendors for details of any fixes that may be made available; vendors
>of products incorporating Kerberos should contact MIT directly for
>details of the problems and fixes.
>
>COAST is a research group of faculty and students dedicated to
>research into information security and computer crime investigation,
>and education in computer and network security.  It is the largest
>such university-based group in the United States.
