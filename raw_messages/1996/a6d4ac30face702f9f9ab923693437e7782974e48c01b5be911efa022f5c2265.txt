Not key escrow - WHAT?!?!?  Then, what do you call giving government 
access to 24 out of 64 bits of the key.  This reduces the keyspace
to a measly 40 bits.  As we have seen - 40 bits is trivial to crack 
without a multi-billion dollar budget.  

I think that Lotus did what all corporations do - it thought 
was best for it's bottom line, and so chose the limited keyspace 
with key-escrow approach.  It is our job (as cypherpunks and US citizens)
to show Lotus and the world that this is NOT a good approach.
