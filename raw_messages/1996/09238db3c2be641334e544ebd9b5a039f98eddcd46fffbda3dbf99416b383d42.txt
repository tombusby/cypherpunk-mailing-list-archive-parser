Ok, forget "entails" try "is a crime."

As for strong arming, ever see a search warrant served at a law firm or a 
trust company, or a bank?

What you miss are provisions for the preservation of evidence called for 
in the order during the hearing process.  The fact that you can fight a 
subpoena has no bearing what-so-ever on the fact that its a crime to 
destroy the evidence until the court rules that its non-material or 
otherwise quashes the subpoena.

I grow tired of being the source of your continuing legal education.

Anyone who knows me knows I spend all my days end arounding the 
U.S. government.  The reason you can't see that is because I don't 
threaten to murder officials, but choose the intellectual detour around 
the myopic laws instead.  I realize that, lacking the facilities to 
pursue the latter, you must resort to the former.

See above.  Has no bearing on the willful destruction of evidence.

What is the function of your elusive super-secret "rosebud" warning 
then?  To tell the account holder to get a cup of coffee and call the 
prosecutor to arrange for the delivery of the sought information?

Subjecting the target to compelled discovery orders $50,000+/day 
fines, contempt charges, and incarceration for non-compliance.  This, by 
the way, regardless of the "incriminating" nature of the evidence.  Fines 
are not going to be refunded if the data/evidence is later proved immaterial.

Again, this still subjects the account holder to fines etc.  God help him 
if he can't produce the desired information.  He's likely to spend quite 
a long time in jail until the judge is convinced that he's telling the 
truth when he says "I threw away the key."

I don't dread it at all.  I simply recognize the limited protection it 
affords the evidence concealer.

I certainly won't endorse moronic schemes that are so out of touch with 
practical and legal reality so as to be laughable.  I will certainly not 
keep quiet when I see, yet another, misleading out-of-rectum-pulled plan 
to evade all liability in the most pervasive and coercive jurisdiction in 
the world.

Word to the wise reader:  If you're considering asset / informational 
protection from discovery or attachement, by all means consult a 
professional.  Mr. Bell's disinformation and illusions are dangerous in 
the extreme.

The what's the purpose of your secret-super-duper "rosebud" warning?  In 
the absence of evidence/information availability to law enforcement at 
the ISP, the account holder will be directly accountable.  Is this a 
better solution?

You've now changed the structure of your "protection" scheme four times 
to duck my criticisms.  This was the same with your inventive but 
impractical nuclear detonation scheme, and your kill-the-pigs "dead pool" 
scheme.

On the part of the ISP, this is possible.  A secret "rosebud" tipoff is 
not the way to do it.  Your constant encryption option is a bit better, 
but still subjects the account holder to an investigation where the ISP 
is compelled to cooperate with the authorities in secret and intercept or 
record the computing session in real time.  Your fourth scheme is thus 
reliant on the trust-worthiness of the ISP, which I have indicated, and 
you have acknowledged by your constant ranting about the abuses of the 
justice system, is dubious at best.

Unfortunately, records can only be completely destroyed in a pre-emptive 
way when they are of no use any longer.  This, again, ignores the 
possibility of real-time investigation or informers.

Once suit is filed there is.

No, instead, knowing of this provision, any plaintiff or prosecutor will 
apply for a TRO to preserve evidence before ever filing for a warrant.  
Review: Fines and contempt that can be leveled for non compliance on 
third parties.

This argument will go over real well in court.

Uh, not precisely so.  Lots of circumstances exist where your home can be 
searched without a search warrant.  Search of premises incident to a 
lawful arrest is just one of them.

I don't like it because it's not a solution, because it's not novel, and 
because courts, law enforcement, prosecutors and private litigants have 
thought of it already and created provisions to prevent it.

You told me nothing.  You hedged, changed your scheme, altered the 
portions I attacked and revered to a previous scheme I had already decimated.

And you made several legal analysis errors, as usual, in the process.

So you might as well murder a few people.  Why not?

Contracts are void to the extent they are illegal.  Obstruction is 
illegal.  Destruction of material evidence to a crime is illegal.  
Conspiracy to obstruct justice is illegal.

Who said I didn't oppose it?  I just don't kill people, or call for their 
death (other than by suicide) to accomplish my goals.

My note contains many.  Consider a pair:

Unites States v. Bank of Nova Scotia, 740  F.2d 817, 832 (11th Cir. 
1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1106 (1985)(upholding $25,000/day fine 
totaling $1,750,000 for failing produce documents located in the Cayman 
Islands under grand jury subpoena duces tecum; Marc Rich & Co., A.G. v. 
United States, 707 F.2d 663, 670 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1215 
(1983)($50,000/day against Swiss corporation for noncompliance with 
subpoena duces tecum demanding documents located in Switzerland).

In both cases the documents were not shown to be material evidence when 
the fines were imposed and the judge was merely assuming they would be 
incriminating.

I don't name specific cases I have been involved in without client 
waiver, but I have myself seen larger fines for less in white collar 
crime cases.
