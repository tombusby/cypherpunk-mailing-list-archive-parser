1. Prostitution is (nominally) illegal in Thailand.

2. So, what would you do? (I'd still make it legal.)

The issue is more complex than many would make it out to be. Where 
prostitution is legal in this country (Nevada) the marketplace seems, 
without the help of Dr. Kessler and his minions, to have dictated the 
universal use of condoms, and the spread of all STDs is slower than in other 
areas, like here in Miami (where prostitution is (nominally) illegal.
