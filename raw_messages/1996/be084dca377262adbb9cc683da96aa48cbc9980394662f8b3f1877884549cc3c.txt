 [Capsule summary: the largest German Internet provider has blocked access
 to webcom.com at the router lever because of one out of a thousand
 subscribers' files, which violate German anti-Nazi laws.]

Someone please inform Deutsche Telekom and the relevant prosecutors that
by the time they read this (i.e., within an hour), selected files from
Zundel's holocaust-denial archives (which make me sick, but that's beside
the point) will be available at the AFS path: 

 /afs/ir.stanford.edu/users/l/llurch/WWW/Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views/

One of the ways this directory can be reached is through:

 http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~llurch/Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views/

Indeed, a simple symlink would be sufficient to make these files available
on any other server at any other organization that mounts AFS, which
include uni-freiburg.de, mathematik-cip.uni-stuttgart.de, ifh.de, desy.de,
zdvpool.uni-tuebingen.de, zdvpool.uni-tuebingen.de, ipp-garching.mpg.de,
afs-math.zib-berlin.de, lrz-muenchen.de, and a dozen other sites in
Germany. 

To be safe, Deutsche Telekom would have to firewall the entire world.

For information on the global distributed AFS file system, which is used
by most major US universities, see http://www.transarc.com/

For my views on the Holocaust, see http://nizkor.almanac.bc.ca/, which 
unfortunately seems to be unreachable from the US at the moment because 
of a routing loop at Seattle.mci.net.

These files will be removed from my directories and replaced by a pointer
to the original URLs if/when it appears that no organization, public or
private, is actively suppressing them. I'm not interested in providing
free Web space. 

It took only four email messages and a half hour of my time to set this 
up. You're kidding yourself if you believe that censorship is even 
halfway effective, much less wise, in the digital age.

The proper response to people like Zundel is documentation and refutation,
such as is practiced by the Nizkor (Remember) project, www.almanac.bc.ca.
I plan to play an active role in distributing Zundel's files only as long
as necessary to prove the censorship point, because I don't want to give
him free space. But I will personally archive his files because I believe
that lies like these should be saved as such, not smothered.
