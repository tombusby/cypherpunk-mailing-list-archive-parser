As far as I know, he was using a satellite phone (probably Inmarsat) on
open ground outside a building. They had been using satellite phones
before, but usually they were transmitting one-way information only
(either voice or video), which had been recorded before, so Dudajev was
not near at the time of connections. This time it had to be two-way,
because he was negotiating with Moscow officials. 

BTW Dudajev was living in Estonia for a long time (before he started
fighting for Chechen independence), being the head of Russian air forces
located in Estonia. Now the building where he was working has been
reconstructed as an hotel, and there is a special Dudajev suite, in case
someone is visiting Estonia :) Estonian people are also very supportive
for Chechen fight for independence.
