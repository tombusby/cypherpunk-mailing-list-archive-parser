SAIC Is @Yourservice for Secure Electronic Transactions
on the Internet

San Diego, 29 Feb 1996 -- Science Applications
International Corp. (SAIC), a leading provider of
information and network security services, today
announced that it will offer a wide range of business
solutions based on the new Secure Electronic Transactions
(SET) standard for safeguarding bankcard purchases over
the Internet.

Through its @Yourservice business unit, SAIC will provide
consulting, integration and digital certification
services to financial institutions, network operators and
merchants doing business over open networks.

SAIC helped Visa and Microsoft in their pioneering effort
to bring security to on-line commerce, and played a major
role in crafting the SET standard, working for Visa and
in close association with MasterCard and other SET
technology partners.

SAIC has long been one of the largest and most trusted
suppliers of information, network and data security
solutions in the world, as well as being a major
information systems integrator for government and
commercial clients.

"We're bringing these skills, and our understanding
of SET complexities such as digital signatures, public
key cryptography, certificate management and network
protocols together to help businesses transition smoothly
into the world of electronic commerce," said Nick
DiGiacomo, who oversees @Yourservice.  "What we offer is
seamless integration from the cardholder's computer over
the networks to the merchants and banks, and back again. 
We're here to make this easy."
