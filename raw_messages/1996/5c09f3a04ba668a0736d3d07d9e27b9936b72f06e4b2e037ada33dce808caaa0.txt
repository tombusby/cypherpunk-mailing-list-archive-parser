	Hmm.... has anyone ever created a specialized computer (or computer
running a specialized program) that would put multiple screens on the same

read Netscape material while watching the other numbers, they're then in the
exact same situation from their viewpoint.

	I should have remembered this from reading Liar's Poker; thank you.
