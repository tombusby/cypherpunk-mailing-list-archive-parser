Glad that lying anti-racist jerk is leaving.  With all his/her's 
nyms, rc graves is impossible to trust. Mike Beebe, Beowulf,
ezundel, nietzsche, ernstzundel and others to make transparent
trolls the ignorant anti-racist makes up.

Mike Beebe: Posted that he WILL murder David Irving, simply 
because Irving was rejected by St Martins Press because of
"controversial material."

Noticeable about capitali$t graves, he dissmisses EVERY attempt
to censor racists with a "who cares," "there just a bunch
of weinies," "if you can be heard *somewhere* without being
arrested, it's not censorship," etc.  He seems to imply that
merely because racists are powerless, we are not worthy of
protection.  I suppose if you have enough money, you can
PURCHASE your freedom, if not, tough shit.

We free-speachers don't need a character who defends the 
prosecutors when racists are sued or imprisoned in Canada,
UK, and Germany, merely for printing racist leaflets.
