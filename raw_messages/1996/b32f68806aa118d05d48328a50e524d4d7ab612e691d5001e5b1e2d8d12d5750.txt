Microsoft had to agree to validate crypto binaries against
a signature to make sure they weren't tampered with, in 
exchange for shipping crypto-with-a-hole.  They will
sign anything (theoretically) if it has the export
papers and all.  Or without, if you affadavit it is not
for export.

They do not themselves impose any restrictions on crypto
strength.

I'm not expressing political position here, just conveying facts ....
