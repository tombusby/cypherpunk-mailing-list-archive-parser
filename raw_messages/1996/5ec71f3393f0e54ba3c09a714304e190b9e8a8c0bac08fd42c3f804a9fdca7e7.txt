Hi all,

Perhaps I am confused about what MixMaster's license allows. I have joined
the confusing part (for me anyway)...

README.no-export :

All the files in this archive contain crpytographic code which is
restricted by the ITAR regulations on munitions.
These files may only be retrieved by US citizens, and only on condition of
agreement not to export any of this software or dats, and to extract
a similar agreement from any person they may transfer it to.

To access the export-controled materials on
this site, you must agree to "THE AGREEMENT"
below. If your email address ends in one of the following:

.edu .com .edu. .gov .mil .org .net .us .ca

Do this by sending "THE AGREEMENT",
exactly as it appears, to

   mix-request@jpunix.com


If it does not, but you qualify to retrieve 
Mixmaster under "THE AGREEMENT", then send mail
to perry@alpha.jpunix.com, explaining your
situation.

In either case you will be sent a message containing
the name of a hidden directory in which you will
find the controlled software. The name of the directory
changes frequently, so you must get the name
each time you want to access the hidden directory.

--------------------------------------------------
	THE AGREEMENT:
I am a citizen or national of the United States,
or of Canada, or have been lawfully admitted for permanent
residence in the United States under the
Immigration and Naturalization Act.

I agree not to export Mixmaster, or RSAREF
or any other software in this archive,
in violation of the export
control laws of the United States of America as implemented
by the United States Department of State Office of
Defense Trade Controls.

Before I download Mixmaster, I will read
and agree to the terms and conditions of the RSAREF
license (in ftp://ftp.jpunix.com/pub/rsalicen.txt).

I will use Mixmaster solely for non-commercial purposes.

What confuses me is the part above that states that I agree to use Mixmaster
for solely non-commercial use. This is NOT GNU or copyleft.
