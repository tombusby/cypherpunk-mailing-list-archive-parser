Reuters, however, just moved a story saying the FBI and Dept. of Justice
denied there was *any* investigation ongoing. The agencies were responding

Such denials are *extremely* rare; agenices almost always refuse to confirm
or deny investigations. Those of you with access to AOL can check the story
