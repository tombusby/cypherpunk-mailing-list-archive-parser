Neither Rush Limbaugh or Pat Buchanan are populists.  Populists tend to
believe in strong government with strict regulation of business, an
actually progressive tax system, confiscation of businesses which break
the rules, government enterprise in competition with the private sector,
no secrecy in government of the type required in the private sector,
bias toward small businesses and sole proprietors, etc.
Letting business "do whatever they want", really doesn't qualify.
FWIU, Buchanan's only claim is opposition to "free trade"(forcing the US
to trade)

AFWIU, Jefferson didn't like slavery, and later freed his slaves,
but considered it necessary for business when he practiced it.
