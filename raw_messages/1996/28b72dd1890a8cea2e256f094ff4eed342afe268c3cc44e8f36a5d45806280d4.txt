The way you protect your home address is by using another address for
work which is not your home.  The way I would do this is to find a
mail box service which offers addresses that look like a home.

A homeless person might find somebody with a home (like you) who will
receive their work related mail for them.

A "phone" is easy to get, too.  You can get a telephone number which
is linked to a voicemail box.  You can even get this number listed in
the telephone book, if you like.  The cost of this service should be
less than twenty dollars a month.  If you want to go wild, you can get
a pager linked voicemail number.  This means your pager goes off when
you get a message.  Handy.

But, even this small expense may be out of reach of a homeless person
or a homeless advocate.  What you can do is get a second line for your
home and keep it unlisted.  Then, give it to your homeless friends for
work related purposes.  If the number is only used for work messages,
you could probably handle over a hundred people on this one line.

As for the social security number, it has been claimed many times on
this list that nobody checks them anyway.  There are programs which
generate real-appearing numbers.  (I think one was called "ssn.exe".)

And, you can go to the SSA to find out somebody's SS number or to have
one issued.  It will take awhile.

This gives the appearance that you are avoiding the points I raised.
My conclusion is that your views are indefensible.  Having described
my views on the poor as "idiotic", I think it is in poor taste to
withdraw from the field without justifying your claim.

Cryptoanarchy is not friendly to schemes to prohibit racial
discrimination.  Indeed, it is unfriendly to any scheme which attempts
to control the relationships between people.

>I, personally, find racial discrimination to be a problem in the USA.

It would be nice if everybody in the U.S. was not a racist.  It would
be nice if all the bad people just left.

But, of course, I don't subscribe to the notion that market efficiency
is the best means of determining policy.  For one thing, concepts such
as efficiency and production are politically defined.  If I grow food
for myself, it does not affect GDP figures.  If I trade the food for
money and buy something, then the same production increases GDP.  This
is not sensible.

More importantly, I don't believe that market efficiency, however
measured, is sufficient justification for dictating other people's
actions.  "Market efficiency" is a gambit to conceal dictatorial
powers in a scientific cloak.

Discussions of market efficiency typically overrule the preference
that citizens have.  One could imagine that a study that concluded
alcohol consumption reduced national efficiency and should therefore
be banned.  Yet, this completely fails to take into account the strong
preference many people have to drink.  Some even consider it to be a
religious sacrament.  I don't believe such preferences should be
ignored.  They should be respected.

Likewise, if somebody just cannot stand Albanians, we should respect
their preference even though we may personally disagree with it and
even though we may believe it makes the annual GDP number lower.

I am not sure exactly what "costly ... in personal measures" means.
If you mean that somebody who will not speak with Albanians is
deprived of rewarding friendships they might otherwise have, that is
probably true.  On the other hand, the Albanian-hater will not see it
that way.  That is his or her tough luck.

>I do expect many on the list to disagree with me....They will
>disagree that it affects markets in any way.

Just for the record, I can imagine that racial prejudice could have a
slight effect on mortgage prices (i.e, interest).  But, since the CMO
revolution, I am inclined to believe that effect will be quite small
and is probably unnoticeable.

Just for the record, I am not advocating "industry self-policing".
Policing is what I disagree with.

All you have really said is "I believe X."  Should we take your belief
on faith or are there reasons which underly your beliefs?

Yet, you are doing something very similar when you raise the issue of
"a libertarian's ideal society".  Likewise, you criticized Tim May for
having (roughly) "too absolute a theory".  In either case, you are
avoiding substantive discussion, preferring to make prejudicial
remarks.

Here we are discussing some very specific policies and their ethical
implications.  There is no need to raise the specter of the
"libertarian ideal society".  One nice thing about Libertarian-style
discussions is that most of the policies are separable; that is, we
can discuss redlining without discussing highway privatization.  This
makes a nice contrast to other styles of discussion in which the
proposed scheme only works if everybody participates.  The most
extreme example was Marxism where it was claimed that it would fail if
the entire world was not Marxist.

>Do you tend to think of me now as "less of a Libertarian" much as

"In the house"?  This appears to be an American idiom which I haven't
learned yet.

I used the word "forewarned" once.  I said that it would be hard to
believe that even wealthy African-Americans were racist in their
lending practices.  I still find it hard to believe.

It may surprise you to know that I am not all the interested in
whether you call yourself a Libertarian.

Your reluctance to discuss the nature of the harm you perceive does
not give the impression that you have good reasons for your
perception.
