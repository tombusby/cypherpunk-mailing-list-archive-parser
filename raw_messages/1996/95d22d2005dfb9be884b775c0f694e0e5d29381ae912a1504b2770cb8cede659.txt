It was from The Newspapers, of course :-)  The "$10,000 of supercomputer time"
was in an initial press release description by somebody in Netscape or RSA
after the RC4/40 Netscape crack, and was way high.  (Check Altavista...)

However, it's not too far off for the cost of a DES crack, where "supercomputer"
is defined as "a special-purpose cracking machine" rather than "a Cray"..
(Maybe an order of magnitude high for that.)  And the description of
$10,000 as "maybe enough to protect my checking account, but not large enough
for the accounts of a major corporation" is about right.
