The Mont Blanc carried quite a lot of fun stuff.  "Stored in the holds, or
simply stacked on deck, were 35 tons of benzol, 300 rounds of ammunition, 10
tons of gun cotton, 2,300 tons of picric acid (used in explosives), and
400,000 pounds of TNT."  Thursday December 6, 1917.  The greatest
conventional explosion produced by mankind.

Governments shouldn't be trusted with high explosives.  They can't be
counted upon to handle them properly.
