Sameer will certainly correct me if I'm wrong, but remailers like c2 store
an encrypted header that is a path through the remailer system.

Since each nesting level is encrypted to that level's remailer, the other
levels only know which remailer to pass the message along to.  If you
really want to be secure, run your own remailer so that nasty folk can't
tell which of the encrypted messages are for you, and which your machine is
passing along.  I'd have a seperate account that I used solely for pointing
these c2 style messages to that had a procmail setup that would add a copy
of each message to my real mailbox and generate a random garbage file that
was a random number of bytes smaller than the incoming mail and premail it
through the remailer chain until it hit a /dev/null address.  That way, for
every message that entered your remailer one would exit for the benefit of
any traffic analysts.  I'd also make sure that the c2 address passed
through my remailer at least twice.

I can't stand netscape's mailer and newsreader so I use Eudora Light and
just have netscape set to a bogus email address.
