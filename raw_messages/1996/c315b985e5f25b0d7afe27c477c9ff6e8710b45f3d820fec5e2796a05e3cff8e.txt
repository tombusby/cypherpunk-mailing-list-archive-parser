One thing you have to assess, is: what is the percentage of the population who
longs for a 'free lunch'.  And also, how much money is a big company willing to 
subsidise the predictor of the 'suicide' of a new competitor (the case of the 
lone inventor with patents rights and a revolutionary invention).  If you 
underestimate this number, you (or other like-minded peoples) might very well 
end up on the exit end of a gun barrel...

But anyways, if I were you, I'd watch my back.  The spooks are probably already trying
to figure out a way out of it.
