OTOH, you have to admit that the possibility of being attacked by a (most
likely) better armed criminal has bothered many cops - it has to be a
rather stresful job. Sadly, they seem to either a) overreact as noted
above or b) be led by idiots who order the above...  I used to be a
fidonet point off of a board run by a cop. He was very reasonable, and
unfortunately seemed to be right at the point where he had enough
"empowerment" to be blamed but not enough to shine a little common sense
into things... Almost like Vietnam - the grunts get shot and ridiculed
because the desk-pilots can't make a valid policy. I liked Tom Clancy's
description of the CIA: "We have a lot of people who are good at ordering
their martninis shaken, not stirred."

See, you need to use that computer - automated defense systems. Bet it
could do okay with a ballistics module... <g>

What's really funny is that nobody seems to notice that criminals aren't
that concerned with breaking laws.  I think some people need to go to
Dogbert's school of Common Sense...
