	Van Ness Avenue and Golden Gate Avenue, in the Civic Center
	neighborhood)
What:	Dan Bernstein's case to declare the export controls
	unconstitutional will hold a hearing in which the judge will

	to decide whether to strike down the ITAR and AECA as
	unconstitutional, throw out the case, or do something in

	strongly recommended; you're going to court, remember!
Why:	To see justice in action; to hang out with your friends; to be

...
I have read about "cypherpunk dress up day" and found it a good 
oppotunity to let Japanese reader of Wired know about law suit and 
circumustance of encription exporting, as well as actual activity of 
cypherpunk people.  So far, "cypherpunk" is more like just a image/notion 
 than actual living people to Japanese.

If I can take a couple of group pictures after the court, I can develop 
an article for their Feb '97 issue.

I hope it is ok with you and lots of lots of people show up this friday!

Rika
