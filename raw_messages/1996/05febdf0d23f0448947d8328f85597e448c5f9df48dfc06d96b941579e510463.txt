The murder of the actress Rebecca Schaefer (sp?) by an obsessed fan (who
paid a private detective to get her address from the California DMV) did
cause California to somewhat restrict license and registration information.
I think they eased up though later.  I don't know who can get info there
these days.

This particular problem can be avoided privately by reporting a mail drop
rather than your real address to the state.
