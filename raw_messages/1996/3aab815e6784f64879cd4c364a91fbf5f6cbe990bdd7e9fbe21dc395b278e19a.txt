I believe you will find much of what you want at 

http://www.privacy.org/pi/activities/mondex/

which describes the trading standards complaint filed in the UK, and
largely upheld by the UK government; the complainant alleged Mondex was
saying it was anonymous when it was not.

See also, 

http://www.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/articles/oceanno.htm#xtocid583129

for a discussion of Mondex (surrounded by a discussion of its
competitors).  The article was written prior to the decision referenced
above.
