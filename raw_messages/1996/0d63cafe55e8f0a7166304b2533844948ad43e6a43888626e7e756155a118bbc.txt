When I was a teenager I read /The Great Impostor/, the 
autobiography of Fred Demara(sp?).  It was an eye-opener.
Demara posed as all sorts of people.  He didn't read any
books on the subject of identity, he just invented his own
techniques.  Because he was always learning, he was always
getting caught.  Each failure, however, just made his next
effort that much better.  Read it if you can find it; it's
facinating.
