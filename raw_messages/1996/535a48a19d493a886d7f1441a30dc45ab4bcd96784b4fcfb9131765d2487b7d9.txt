No, it simply means he thinks that Bell is a loon. I thought that for a
while, too, but now I think he's simply politically immature, and into
novelty acts. I am also pleased to see Bell seem to learn and mature over
the last few months, as I know I have. Nobody is irredeemable. I have
never killfiled anyone, though I've ignored people from time to time as a
way of controllin gmy blood pressure.

Detweiler was right when he talked about the thin skins and huge egos
here. Why cry "censor" when somebody simply tells you to shut up? It's
called social pressure, and it's a good thing. You may respond to social
pressure however you wish.

Likewise "PC." He may correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you are
mistaken in your implication that hochiminh means to imply that TC May is
a racist. "Ignorance and intolerance" are different animals entirely, and
speaking on a purely analytical rather than moral level, I believe these
terms are accurately applied to Tim's statements, especially about
non-English speakers and nuking the Japs.  But I recognize Tim's good
humor (in all three meanings), and think he's a great guy, as are most of
the inmates in this particular asylum. 

My parents and a couple of friends at work are right-wing fundamentalist
loons, and a couple of friends from school are left-wing multiculturalist
loons. From this vantage point, I learn a lot. It's really funny comparing
the presentation of left-wingers in right-wing propaganda to the
presentation of right-wingers in left-wing propaganda. It seems that
cypherpunks gets the worst extremes of both. Sometimes I play along (too
often, probably, so I'm learning how to resist being trolled -- Michael
Loomis's laughable "Rich Graves, Holocaust fetishist" was a good test),
sometimes I just sit back and watch.

You will see none of these terms anywhere but in failed trial balloons and
parodies of the supposedly politically correct, of course. It's really
amazing how a myth can take on a life of its own. 

The left has the same kind of ludicrous misconceptions about the religious
right. I'll tell my parents some of the things my leftist friends have
been told about some of the organizations my parents belong to, and they
say, huh? Tell a feminist what Pat Robertson says about feminists, and she
says, huh?

I once met a guy in Hollister who did.

I still resent being packed off to church, and I certainly oppose state-
sponsored school prayer; but anyone who goes out of their way to ridicule
someone else's beliefs, or who intentionally disrupts someone else's
worship, is an asshole, IMHO.

I would agree with this wholeheartedly if you turned down the volume about
80%. I hardly think it takes that much courage to disagree with PC
excesses, especially the ones that don't exist, like this "vertically
challenged" bullshit. It certainly doesn't take much courage on the
cypherpunks list.

Admitting that you pray -- now, that takes courage, well, in polite
circles in California it does.

I'm all for that. Anyone for a little croquet?
