<sigh!>  I am well aware of the facts you indicate, and many more of which
you aren't even aware.  But one of the functions (in fact, the basic,
intended one) of GPS is to locate, as precisely as possible, the exact
location of the receiver.  Thus, time delays can be compensated to the
accuracy of the location fix, at the very least.  If we assume 100 meters
error, max, that's about 300 nsec error.  (GPS receivers AUTOMATICALLY
compensate for such delays!)

Well, this clock doesn't pretend to be better than about 5-10 milliseconds
even in signal-locked condition.  However, there is a dipswitch on the
bottom of the unit, settable in 500 mile increments, from Boulder, Colorado.
500 miles corresponds to 3 milliseconds.  Clearly this was a good device
when made, but has obviously been supplanted by at least a factor of 1000 by
GPS.

Simple answer:  You don't.  More complicated answer:  Most such devices
don't merely input the time signal, but they use an accurate internal clock
to maintain good time when signals go away.  In fact, the best units
"discipline" the local oscillator, either actually changing its frequency or
at least following its errors over time.  The result is that sudden errors
would be noticed.  A good TCXO is stable to well better than 1 ppm.

Well, since "everybody" in one locale can receive a particular (local) TV
channel, one solution might be to compare time with respect to the beginning
of a particular scan line..  You may not trust the signal, but you know its
a signal that "everybody" receives.  There may be no other provision for
adding time to it, but a relatively low accuracy crystal oscillator could
identify particular frames, etc.
