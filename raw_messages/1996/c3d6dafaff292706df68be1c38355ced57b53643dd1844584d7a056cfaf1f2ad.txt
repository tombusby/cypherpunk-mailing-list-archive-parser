No, he was right.  They can't prove that their system is unbreakable.
They _might_ be able to prove that their system hasn't been broken, and
they _might_ be able to prove that it is _unlikely_ that it will be, but
they *CAN NOT* prove that it is unbreakable.  This is the nature of
cryptosystems.

It is impossible to prove such a thing.  It's like saying you have proof
that you have the last car of a certain model ever to be built.  Anybody
could come along and build another, and then you don't have the last one.

There *IS NO SUCH PROOF*.  Just like you can't prove that god created the
universe, or that Oswald shot Kennedy, and so on and so forth.  It can't
be proven.  It never has been proven, and it never will be proven.  People
have new ideas, new algorithms are invented.  Someday, somebody will crack
_all_ the cryptosystems that have now been invented.

Or, better yet, release this "proof", so that we may punch holes in its
flawed logic.

Use an anon. remailer and sign your posts.  Brilliant.  Just brilliant.
