A very good question, and one not answered by the Utah Act. The answer to
the question of what constitutes reasonable care for holders of private
keys will have to be addressed through the long, expensive, and inelegant
process of common law evolution: court case after court case after court
case slowly providing an answer. In contrast, the duties of certification
authorities are explicitly described in the Act.

An interesting point, which can be spun several ways. The nuclear 
industry has been able to externalize the immense costs of waste storage, 
etc. Would the same investments have been made in nuclear energy if the 
nuclear industry was forced to internalize all of the costs it generates, 
including the costs of potential accidents? Probably not. I suspect that 
you could find people who would argue that the liability limits have had 
very good consequences (i.e., promoting investment in an ultimately 
beneficial technology) and others who would say that the current state of 
the nuclear industry points out the harm in allowing an industry to 
externalize costs.

Agreed. Letting market forces sort out the most appropriate risk 
allocations may be the best solution. This isn't really what the Utah Act 
does, however.

For the record: Someone else who responded to my post on the Cypherpunks 
list referred to me as "Dr. Biddle." I think they were misled by Phil 
Agre's characterization of me as an "academic" in his introduction to my 
article. (Or perhaps just dazzled by the force of my arguments). I am, in 
fact, a law *student*, not a law professor.
