Free-lance writer and co-author of "Practical UNIX Security" seeks
substantive reliable sources, preferably for attribution, on the history
of the SMB, C$, and .PWL encryption bugs in both Windows 95 and Windows
for Workgroups, but especially on what problems will remain after next
week's "Service Pack 1." He might drop the story because of a dearth of 
sources and promises from Microsoft that everything has already been 
fixed, and will be distributed to the Netless masses via the SP 1 CD 
(the contents of which are not public knowledge, but which surely went to 
manufacturing some time ago...).

I don't want to spam his mailbox, but his PGP key is 0x903C9265, with 
fingerprint 68 06 7B 9A 8C E6 58 3D  6E D8 0E 90 01 C5 DE 01. You might 
also run into him in person at this week's RSA Data conference in San 
Francisco.

Please reply directly to the reporter with a subject line starting with 
"MS*" (assuming that's not too maudlin for you) because he gets a lot of 
mail. He isn't seeking any more mail on unrelated subjects.

Stuff funnelled through me, especially from anonymous sources, is properly
not considered relibable (though I might appreciate a Cc). 

Bcc'd to the reporter.
