So Mr Smarty Pants, how does it feel to be the second most intelligent life
form on the planet? Your polysyllabic phrasing does not fish you from
the unfortunate and precarious position of only being in the second most
august and lofty eyrie of intellect in the upward spiral of extropian
realisation.

Ha!

As the Shadow president of the Alien Consortium that controls MENSA
through the Boy Scout Freemason Recruitment Program, I refute your
dubious and somewhat ill-considered claims to being the very paragon of
intelligence.

I can.

11. Prove me wrong.

Bullshit. I just did

PRNG.Its hard to forget such a stupid name.

No, it only looks debunked because your mind has been unhinged.

No. It has been filled with hot air in the hope that the argument will float.

Log_base_infinity? You can't quantify this? The name for this kind of
tricky sum is in fact, rhetoric.

I laugh about your need to be so prissy about a simple fart.

>(Montgolfiering. Q.E.D.--"it has been deflated")

heh. yeah right.
