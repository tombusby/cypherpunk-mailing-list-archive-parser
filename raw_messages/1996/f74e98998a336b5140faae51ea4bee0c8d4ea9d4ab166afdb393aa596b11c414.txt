Is anyone else wondering if Dole's handlers are dosing him with that
"Halcyon" stuff that (partially) caused Bush to be such an easy mark
for David Letterman et al.? We have a *severe* drug problem in this
country...

P.S.
I tell you...one little mishap involving a little bit too much sugar,
and now I'll _never_ get to live it down...:) Those wishing to attend
my "Pennies For Perot" Party at Hooters in Cocowalk, at 6:00PM, on
Saturday, August 3rd please e-mail me.

P.P.S.
Idea: Wiretap citizen-unit Ray for 47 hours and 59 minutes, give him
one minute of non-surveilance (more than he deserves, actually) and
then repeat process, with no pesky judges. Citizen-unit Ray is known
to enjoy firearms, and has said "It's easier to make a bomb than it
is to make a lasagna" in the past. He's also a known cardcarrying
member of the Libertarian Party.

posted that often...This kind of misunderstanding of Libertarians
is usually caused by a subscription to Time, etc. -- rather than a
careful listening to Libertarians themselves, but believe whatever
you want.
