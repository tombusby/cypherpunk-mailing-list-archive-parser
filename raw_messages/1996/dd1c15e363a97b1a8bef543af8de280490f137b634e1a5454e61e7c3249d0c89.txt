Not only: until at least five or six years ago, the trade unions had
forced limits to the yearly increase in number of computers per year in
the banking sector (if I remember well, 2% a year for private institutions
and 1% for government owned). The government duly obliged, of course.

Tropical climate or "corporate greed" has nothing to do with inefficiency
and poverty: just compare the cases of Hong Kong or Singapore.
Rather, corrupt and populistic governments are the key factor.
