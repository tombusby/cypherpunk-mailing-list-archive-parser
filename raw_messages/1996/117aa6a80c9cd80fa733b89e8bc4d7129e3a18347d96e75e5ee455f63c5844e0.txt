Apart from tehe confidentiality of the customer, bank, all those they 
trade with and all other interested parties, well then, they can`t be 
that important can they

So because we choose to maintain a statist and totalitarian empire we 
had better set an example of how to do it to the rest of the world???

It is also diffult to see why I don`t go round to mr. Bickfords 
house and kill him, his dog, and his pet hamster, but I don`t, nor do 
I intend to, to say that we cannot see a reason for people wanting 
privacy is no justification for legislation that prohibits such 
privacy.

It is a classic example of privacy and freedom in a free society (not 
that I believe Britain falls into this category)
Has anyone got this guys IQ, it`s probably the first ever negative IQ 
in the history of the world, cheer everyone, its a historic find.

Mr. Bickford, I believe you to be a fuckwit, feel free to prove me 
wrong..
