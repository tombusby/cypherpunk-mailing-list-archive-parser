Quite right. In many ways the SyQuest and Iomega products are identical.
However, I'm shooting for the SyQuest because of the advertised 12.5 msec
access time. In any case, the tech is there and it is portable so we can
expect to see a variety of similar products in the future.

I can't answer these questions which is why I started this thread to get
answers from those who have the knowledge required to make meaningful
answers. 
 
The major problem today stopping the proliferation of "temporary" sites
seems to be the user interface. Ultimately, we would want something that
was very easy to use and had incredibly simple user manuals (like the
Army's Training Manuals for really dumb soldiers). You know, the ones that
start: "This is a bullet. It has a pointy end and a flat end. The pointy
end is the end you want to face the enemy. The flat end is the end you want
to face you."

Yeah, and imagine the noise an anti-privacy technician makes when he/she/it
is told to try to extract plaintext from the shredded results.
