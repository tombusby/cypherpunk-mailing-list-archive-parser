As when the Cossacks who fled the U.S.S.R. after the war and pledged to
help the West fight Communism were returned by the British to Stalin, where
they were executed. (I was reminded of this by the latest Bond movie, where
Bond avers, "Not exactly Britain's finest moment.")

Had they been using Brit-GAK, then even more of them could've been rounded
up by the Brits and send packing.

Was Noriega our friend or our enemy, and when? If his followers were using
the U.S. as their friendly keyholder, how would this have played out when
the U.S. government decided to switch sides?

When governments change, the U.S. often switches sides as well. The U.S.
holding the keys of dissidents will not fly.

The notion that the U.S. will become the GAK-holder for the world's
dissidents is too absurd to waste  more time on.
