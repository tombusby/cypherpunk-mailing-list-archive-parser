Alright, I agree. Though this could very easily differ with size and reach 
of a PS.  But on the net it means more bandwidth right? 
Which means more bandwidth, and more money. Hang on. This might not be 
a problem in US (as jim bell points out there is tons of untapped bandwith), 
but it is in other not so well connected countries. 
For example, if somebody spams an Indian Network from india, the
spam goes to US and comes back to india (since our govt sayz you cant connect
2 local networks!) and eats up most of the 20 MBps bandwidth.
Gov't will buy more bandwidth and will make us pay for it!
