I've argued since 1992 on Usenet and here that "crypto as arms" is a
potentially dangerous tack to follow. (Others, including legal experts,
have also argued this point.)

Given that it is well-established, whether we agree or not, that the USG
may restrict private ownership of atom bombs, nerve gases, CBW weapons,
machine guns, switchblade knives, nunchuk sticks, and various other "arms,"
the association of crypto with armaments is potentially *DISASTROUS*.

A far better strategy is to associate crypto with *speech*, which most
people seem to think has stronger protection. And, truth be told, I view
encrypted communications as a helluva lot more like a form of communication
than I view it as a cousin to my Heckler & Koch .45 USP.

In my view, equating crypto with armaments is exactly what the USG would
like to see happen. This legitimizes their control of crypto.
