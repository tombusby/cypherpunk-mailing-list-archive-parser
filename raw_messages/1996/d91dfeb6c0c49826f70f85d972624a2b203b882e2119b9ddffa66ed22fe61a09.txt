This month we'll meet on Saturday so that a couple of folks will
be able to attend Father's Day festivites.  As always, we'll meet
at the Tivoli; send email for directions.

ps -- I haven't been announcing local meetings to the list because
I unsubscribed for a few months...just thought I'd advise everyone
that this meeting will be on a Saturday.  Besides, info about local
meetings is now available at http://www.command.com.inter.net/
thanks to some friends who are frequent attendees.
