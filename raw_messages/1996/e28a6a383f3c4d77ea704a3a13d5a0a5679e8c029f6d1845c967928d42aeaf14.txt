There are lots of copyright notices in PGP.  If you're trying to sell
PGP-derived code in a country that's part of the Berne Copyright Convention
or has other international copyright-honoring agreements,
it may apply.  But you can read it.

Copyright is more widely accepted internationally than patents on
mathematical algorithms, and the RSA patent in particular is not valid in 
most of the world because it was disclosed to the public before
the patent was applied for (to avoid American government tricks that
let the military classify and essentially confiscate processes that
are "national security" related when you apply for the patent.)

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
  and the politicians had to count them all.
