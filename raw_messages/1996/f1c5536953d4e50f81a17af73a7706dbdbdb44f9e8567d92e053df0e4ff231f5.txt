Incorrect.  The account was tc@alumni.caltech.edu, which is not the same
as Hal's remailer at hal@alumni.caltech.edu.  Just an odd coincidence they
were on the same machine. 

There's a whole saga about how CoS tracked the guy down, it's quite a
story.  Rather than go into it here and leave things out or confuse them
further, check out
http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/anon/penet.html for a clear,
concise explanation of the whole bizarre affair.  Check out Ron's "CoS vs
the Net" page while you're at it, at
http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/home.html.

It's also suceptible to hacker attack, as happened a few years ago. 
"Information wants to be free" is not a political statement, it's a fact
of nature.  One property of information is that it tends to spread.  If
you don't want the information to spread, don't store it.
