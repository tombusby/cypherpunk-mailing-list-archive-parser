There was a service of this kind, that was implemented about that time frame (1982?).  Don't recall the name.  However, I don't think they got any kind of explicit monopoly.  It wasn't particularly successful, as I recall, probably because of the low penetration of computers into business during that time frame.  But it was probably intended as a way around the "chicken-and-egg" problem that you can't use email unless the the recipient does, etc.

Recall that the use of faxes "exploded" in about 1985:  Before this, faxes were rare and they were probably primarily used for inter-office communication. (If only 10% of the businesses own faxes, then only (10%x10%=1% of communications can be completed by fax;  If 90% have faxes, 90%x90%=81% can be.)  After this, and by about 1986 or so, just about every ad in industry-type magazines listed a fax number for communications. 
 We're seeing an echo of this for e-mail, 10 years later.  Within a year, it'll be rare to see an ad that _doesn't_ list an email address.  Jim Bell
