My initial impression of Chaum's work, from his 1985 CACM paper,
was that the technology gave you strong anonymity; I was surprised
when I first saw references to payees _not_ being anonymous
(subject to the usual limitations of getting the digicash to them
anonymously and getting the service you want from them anonymously.)
We've had discussions on this list about topics like kidnap ransom,
which need payee anonymity to make sense at all; we later had discussions
about how to provide it given that it wasn't a standard feature.

So first we need to tell people that the technology _won't_ provide
payee anonymity unless used carefully, and then we need to tell them
that it _can_ provide anonymity if you want it....

Depending on the details of Ian's method, I don't think the debate
needs to be taken to the public, or even done - it may simply be a
done deal once the technology's out there.  If Mark Twain Bank or
Merita Bank or the Federal <Exonive-Deleted> Reserve wants to offer Digicash(tm)
with Payee-Non-Anonymity, they can always make it a contractual requirement
that their payees not use anonymity techniques in return for being paid.
