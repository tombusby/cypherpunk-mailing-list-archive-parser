Large numbers of able people with good communications very recently exercised 
their putative "very real power" against the passage of the CDA. They had no
substantial impact AFAICS. (I intend no slur against the effort.)  Could you
name some examples, and add some qualifications that made the difference in
those cases ?

Just in case I'm one of those who "can no longer imagine what a nation is,
other than a nation state", you should perhaps define the term more
concretely. I guess The Nation of Islam might fit, or the worldwide
community of Palestinians.

OK, first of all I'm not convinced that the net qualifies as a "nation", but
it's hard to say until I better understand what you mean by "nation".

_Strong_ nationalism is a powerful force that governments often exploit to
their own considerable advantage, and indeed also brings down governments
in some cases. Offhand, it looks to me as though the USSR did a decent job
of withstanding various strong internal nationalistic forces for a long time, 
and was brought down mainly by other considerations.

Perhaps "often" is the case; from previous experience, I suspect your grasp 
of the relevant history is clearly superior to mine. (You have some great
stuff on your web pages.) I note that you did not claim "all".

OK, but govts. do indeed manage to muster plenty of cohesion in various
actions.

I disagree, but assertions will get us nowhere.

Sure, but the govt. has been changed before and can change again.

I'm honestly very happy to see all this optimism. But unless and until my
pessimism fundamentally changes, I couldn't sleep at night if I were to lie
down and accept the optimistic claims.
