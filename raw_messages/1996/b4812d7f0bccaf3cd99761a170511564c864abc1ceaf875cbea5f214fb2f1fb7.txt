Jonathan has written a very nice essay, most of which I agree with fully.
However, there is one item that I have a different angle on:

Here's my different angle on this: I'm not so sure there even _is_ a
"public" on stories like this. Certainly my brother won't read about this,
nor my sister, nor my parents, nor most of my neighbors.

As with political stories that are read mostly by people interested in
politics, I'm sure that most potential readers of the "First Virtual" story
either skipped right past it or skimmed it lightly. No doubt the FUD of
this story, and the FUD of earlier stories about Internet weaknesses,
random number attacks, etc., left a vaguely feeling in these casual readers
that all is not right with Internet commerce.

But, having said this, I wouldn't underestimate the effects of a group such
as ours lose respect for First Virtual, Nathaniel Borenstein, and Simson
Garfinkel, to the extent we have. We'll be the sorts who keep the story
going, who talk to other journalists, and who make decisions for our
companies on what products and strategies to use.

The "public" has probably already forgotten the story; we have not.
