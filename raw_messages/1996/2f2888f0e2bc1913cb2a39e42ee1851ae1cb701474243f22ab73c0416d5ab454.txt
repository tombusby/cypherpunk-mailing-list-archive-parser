Yes, and I said as much--about the bandwidth limitations--in my post. In
the very next line after you stopped quoting!!!!!:

"Sure, I understand that Internet bandwidth is not the same as the
"public airwaves," but this subtlety may not be enough to stop the parallel
from being successfully drawn. Especially if the phone companies and other
threatened players are pushing hard for the FCC to step in and regulate."

I'm not usually such a quibbler, but it irks me when people stop the
quoting at a certain point, then make the same point made in the elided
section, then say, "But bandwidth is a scarce resource."

Besides which, I think the "scarce resource" argument against crypto over
the airwaves is clearly a fig leaf. Only amateur, non-corporate users are
affected. The intent of the rules, never repealed, seems more of an attempt
to limit the widespread deployment of ham radio for espionage purposes
(e.g., a ham sitting above a harbor area reporting on ship movements).

This is why I said I could see a parallel argument for limiting crypto. And
if other countries are needed to get an international treaty signed, there
will be no shortage of such lap dogs available to do the bidding of the
U.S. The most otherwise-hostile countries to the U.S. will jump at the
chance to impose a worldwide ban on encrypted communications.
