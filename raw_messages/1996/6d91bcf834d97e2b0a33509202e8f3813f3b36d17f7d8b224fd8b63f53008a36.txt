To follow up on a post last year where I suggested that Rabin's 
information dispersal scheme might be useful for sending large files 
across unreliable remailer networks, I built a shareware package called 
Disperse/Collect out of my own Crypto++ library.  Disperse splits up 
files into redundant pieces and encodes them in base 64.  Collect decodes 
them and reconstructs the original files.  You can download this software 
from my home page at http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai.
