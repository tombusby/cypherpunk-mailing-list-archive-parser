I just thought I would re-print this extract from the recent
press release regarding the EUNet/Merita ecash roll-out.


Favorite phrase: "interesting new possibilities."


Follow-ups directed toward e$.  If you post to cpunks without
Cc'ing me I probably won't see it.

******* begin quote from the "companies that accept ecash" section

SOM -- SOM, the Finnish Securities and Derivatives Exchange
and Clearing House,  established in 1987, serves as a 
neutral integrated securities and derivatives exchange and 
clearing house.  SOM offers real-time financial market 
information on stocks, options and futures via the 
Internet, with invoices payable in ecash. Somtel for 
Windows -the application that offers real-time feed, as 
well as simulation and position-analysis functions-, is 
already available via leased line.
 "The use of money makes stock trading less complicated, 
with money acting as a practical intermediary between the 
transactions." states Asko Schrey, President of SOM. 
"However, since stock trades, as well as the shares 
themselves, are electronic nowadays, this conventional 
transmission of money has actually become a bottleneck and 
a threat to the development of the financial world. 
Therefore, SOM actively participates in projects to promote 
and improve the efficiency of payment traffic. We believe 
that electronic money will offer interesting new 
possibilities."
