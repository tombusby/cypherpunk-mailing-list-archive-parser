Apples and oranges.  I was referring to the correlation of college GPA to
SAT scores (which is higher than the correlation between high school GPA and
college GPA).  GPA measures the ability to do college-level work.  As such,
SAT scores are very relevant.  As you said, <completion> of college probably
does involve lots of other factors. I would not expect a high correlation
between standardized test scores and completion rates.

My point exactly.  It is these cultural factors, not the amount of money the
parents make, that is really the important aspect.  It does seem unfortunate
however that in many lower income families, there is less of an emphasis on
scholastic achievement.

Anecdotal evidence, but I have known people at many levels of society.  I
have never met anyone who "works hard" that is in dire straits.  Some have
struggled for a time (I know I did!), but eventually the hard work paid off.
