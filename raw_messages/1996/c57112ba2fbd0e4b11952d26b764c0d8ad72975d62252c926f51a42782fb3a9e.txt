Thank you for the correction. I checked Andre Lemos' original, and he uses
both terms. To quote, "Through thie detournement -- literally, a 'hijacking'
was born the messagerie. By hacking and then making available the bulletin
board software, a counter-current to the French technocratic approach
produced a usage of the system which was never a planned objective."
Slightly inaccurate.

Once again going back to the original: "In 1986 the first roadside
billboards for the messaggeries rose appeared (picturing, for example, a
robust male or a woman with slogan '3515 BUSTY', the online address of a
Mintel rose chat service). French traditionalists were outraged and Charles
Pasqua, acting Minister of the Interior, attacked the gay messagerie Gay
Pied. Worse, the French state gains 36% of the total charges paid. Taxes on
all the messagerie services became the order of the day. France Telecom has
no way of distinguishing between the messagerie rose and any other board or
messagerie. In 1989 the government tax was 30% and in 1991 a 50% tax was
imposed in the hope of eliminating all messageries."

That's seriously innacurate, it seems to me: but I would appreciate some
confirmation before I attack the guy in my review. Will check out the urls
you suggested, problem is during the monsoons the phone connection to my ISP
keeps dropping.

Has FT ever denied permission (to hard-core sex servers or neo-Nazis, for
example)? That, the tax they charge and the prohibition of encryption make
it too centralized for my taste. And will ultimately kill it. The longer the
French take to migrate to the Internet, the worse for them (IMHO).

Why not link up videotex in every country with the Internet? Let people surf
the Web using their TVs and remotes (and maybe a keyboard with an infra-red
link). That's what I'm trying to tell our utter failure of a videotex
service in India.
