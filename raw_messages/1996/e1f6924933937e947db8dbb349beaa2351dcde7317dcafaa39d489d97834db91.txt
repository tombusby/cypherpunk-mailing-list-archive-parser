It seems that in order for this to work Net consumers must be
convinced/coerced into accepting the GAK security features.  What if, due
to a grassroots uprising, Neters refuse to use products which require GAK
or Net services which will only operate via GAK?  Isn't there an great
opportunity being created for S/Wan, Apache and its ilk and third-party
(especially off-shore, non-COCOM, produced) security plug-ins?

Enacting laws which make criminals out otherwise upstanding citizens is the
surest path to civil disobedience/unrest, disrespect for duly constituted
government and more serious criminal behavior.  I guess I and many friends
will be on posters in the Post Office.
