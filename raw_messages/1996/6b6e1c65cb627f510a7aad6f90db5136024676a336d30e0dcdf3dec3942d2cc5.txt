Do you assume that all useful algorithms are patented or copyrighted?
Would you further assume that executable encryption programs would have
to be resident on some particular media long enough (say, 30 seconds to
a few minutes) that agents who have just broken the door in will be able
to preserve either the source code or the executable code and take it
with them as evidence?

I know that the FDA cracks down on what it terms "dangerous substances"
and "practicing (something or other) without an appropriate license",
but the folks it crashes in on are generally distributing herbs, vitamins,
and other goodies which wind up inside of people's bodies, so there is
a measure of legitimacy to their protections, if not to their methods.
Protecting people from ideas and algorithms which go into their minds is
feasible only when the ideas are complex enough and require sufficient
physical manipulations (designing and building a fusion bomb, for example)
as to make the implementor of such things quite noticeable.

So the only possible Public Key encryption has all been designed and
patented, and there's no other algorithms that can be brought forth,
let's say, by someone who doesn't want a patent, but merely wants to
put the idea out into the public domain?

I suppose if some angel were to float out a new Public-key algorithm onto
the Net, then there would automatically be an anti-angel (from the NSA?)
who would show that it was in fact patented, and had to be withdrawn?
My guess is, if they tried this too many times through legal channels,
in spite of all manner of legislation, there would be a backlash of
sufficient proportion to render their efforts less than useful.
