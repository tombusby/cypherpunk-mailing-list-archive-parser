I've been skipping most of the "floatingpointpunks" messags, but will note
that several languages I personally use (however infrequently) have
"bignum" support and support full-precision calculations. These include:
LISP and Scheme, Smalltalk, and Mathematica.

If performance is not an issue, the bignum packages available in C and C++
ought to be sufficient for any financial needs.

And Hal Finney is working on a bignum package for Java.
