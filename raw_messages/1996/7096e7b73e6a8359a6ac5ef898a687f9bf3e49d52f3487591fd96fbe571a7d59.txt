Differentiate between the cipher and the key-initialization.  There 
may be a flaw in how the key is set up that can make brute-force 
searches easier.  Known plaintext of a few headers may also help in 
guessing the s-box state, even if partially: combined with flaws in 
the key, this could be exploited, especially if one has a lot of 
experience and computing power handy.

Risky.  Code can always be reverse engineered.  If a flaw is 
exploited in too-strong an algorithm (3DES and 4k-bit RSA keys, for 
instance) to prosecute various people, somebody might notice. If US 
companies seem to magically have proprietary info from foreign 
companies, this would also be a sign of suspicion.   I think the
C[r]API will be used as a form of mandating GAK instead.
