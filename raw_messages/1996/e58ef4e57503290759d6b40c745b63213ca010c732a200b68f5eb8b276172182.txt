Actually, it is much better than Eudora and has plug-ins for 
encryption.  The native encryption sucks, and the author warns 
against it (it's there as a demo of the crypto API!).

There *is* a PGP-plugin (w/source) that uses PGP to 
encrypt or decrypt mail and add keys.  The last version I saw had 
shitty key management... if you're emailing somebody at an address 
different from the key-id, it didn't prompt you for another key (and 
Pegasus 2.2 sent it out in cleartext!).

I don't like the add on much, but many others do, aware of that flaw 
and some others.

Seems like the person who wrote that message doesn't know what he's 
talking about.

There's a difference between snake oil and a user who doesn't 
understand a product.
