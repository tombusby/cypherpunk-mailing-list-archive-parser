A far better solution would be to have a long-running daemon hold the
secret key.  The mixmaster client could talk to the key daemon through
a unix-domain socket with the permission bits set such that only the
mixmaster user can connect.  Each time the machine is rebooted, the
operator must start the daemon and give it a passphrase.

This has two advantages.  First, it's a lot harder to back up the key
by accident.  If the key ever starts making it only your daily
backups, you are completely hosed because erasing a bunch of mag tapes
would take a lot of time--and maybe you also want to keep your
backups.

Second, if your machine is seized or someone gains unauthorized
physical access to it, the easiest way to get a root shell is by
rebooting single-user.  However, if the only cleartext copy of a key
is in memory rather than in the filesystem, once the machine is
rebooted the secret key is lost.
