The "cypherpunks archives" is not owned by the cypherpunks or 
maintained by toad.com (which is the host of the actual list).  The 
owner of infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks webpage maintains the archive.  
It is his effort and his choice to restrict the browser.

Anyone is free to provide an archive the list.  And anyone can read 
the list.

Agreed.  

But the cypherpunks is not an "organization" in the strictest sense.  
The only "official" aspect of cypherpunks is the list hosted at 
toad.com.

Of course not.  But the owner of http://infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks 
disagrees and since it's his website and he pays for it and compiles 
it...
