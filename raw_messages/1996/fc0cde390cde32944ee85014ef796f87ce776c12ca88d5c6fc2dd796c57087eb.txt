Good Times Virus Hoax
=====================

The "Good Times" virus warnings are a hoax. There is no virus by that
name in 
existence today. These warnings have been circulating the Internet for
years. 
The user community must become aware that it is unlikely that a virus
can be 
constructed to behave in the manner ascribed in the "Good Times" virus 
warning. For more information related to this urban legend, reference
CIAC 
Notes 95-09.
