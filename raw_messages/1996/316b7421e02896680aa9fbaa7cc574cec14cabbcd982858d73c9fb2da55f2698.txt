Remember a couple of years ago on the Extropians list when I claimed to
have compiled dossiers on people, from their admissions in posts about drug
use, infidelities, and other such things? Several of them got quite irate.

Not all such advice, because my advice has been different from this.

Or, the option I prefer: do what you gotta do, and screw those who claim
you should be ashamed of yourself.

Think of this as a screening process: anyone who is so offended or ashamed
for you (what a concept: "I'm ashamed for you") probably is not someone you
would want to deal with. Works for me.

I'm not trivializing the issue of search engines and archiving systems
turning up articles written, old posts, etc. Every couple of weeks,
sometimes more often, someone sends me a copy of one of my postings and
claims that someone else must be forging my name (recent posts on racial
issues, for example--while I'm not a racist, I despise quotas, setasides,
and preferential treatment for lazy people, of any race...this obviously
makes some people "ashamed for me" :-}).

These people, obsessed with political correctness, or having some notion
that consistency must be enforced, are the populist form of Thought Police.
Mostly I ignore these people pestering me to "explain" a post I made in a
group, and, if they persist, I add them to my filter file. I prefer this
liberated outlook to either of the two options you presented.
