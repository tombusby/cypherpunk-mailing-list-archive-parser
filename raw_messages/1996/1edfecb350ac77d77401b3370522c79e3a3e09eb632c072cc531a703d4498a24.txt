   "CIA Defends Rule on Use Of Reporters."

      In the face of growing criticism from American news
      organizations, CIA Director John M. Deutch yesterday
      insisted he would not rule out employing American
      journalists in secret intelligence operations where
      American lives are at stake or a weapon of mass
      destruction might be used.

   2-23-96. NYT:

   "C.I.A. Chief Defends Secrecy, in Spending and Spying, to
   Senate."

      The DCI said today that the secret budget for spying
      might be made public, and he defended a longstanding
      policy allowing clandestine officers to pose as
      reporters or to use journalists as informers. Posing as
      a reporter is an ideal cover for a spy, since both jobs
      require traveling to out-of-the-way places and prying
      out secrets.
