I can easily visualize mobile and portable systems linking to an ISP, 
downloading email via encrypted POP/UUCP/whatever, using itinerant 2m or 
450 MHz frequencies.  A mobile system connects to any ISP, gets a login: 
prompt, enters "xyz@host.domain", gets thrown into a POP session on 
host.domain, uploads/downloads, then disconnects.  All it would really 
require is implementing "exec rlogin -l xyz host.domain" into getty (a 
very simple patch) and suitable crypto protocols...
