Cool.  Get your fresh CD's via WWW and UPS.  Pay with Mark 
Twain ecash.


This is the first thing (excepting, of course, BAP, cyberbuck
gambling, and pornography) that I actually want to buy with
ecash.


And I spend time crawling www.cdnow.com even when I don't
want to spend money, just to read the words and look at the
pictures.

This has been a public service announcement.  CDNow is not
paying me.  (Although, of course, they are welcome to send
me some free CD's in return for my kind words...)
