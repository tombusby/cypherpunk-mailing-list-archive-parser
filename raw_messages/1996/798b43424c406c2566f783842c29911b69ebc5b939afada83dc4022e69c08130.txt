If the wimps at the NRA had any guts, they  would poll their membership, 
asking if anybody would be willing to make "the sacrifice" (presumably due 
to a recent terminal illness diagnosis).  Then, they'd get on the phone to 
the Supreme Court, and point out that they'd just noticed that Supreme Court 
appoints were ONLY "good for life" and suggest nicely that if all of the 
above outrages (WRT guns) weren't reversed within the year, they predict 
about nine open seats shortly thereafter.

Okay, maybe it's only wishful thinking, but...

If you take the position that all human life is equally valuable, then you 
must concede that the deaths of nine fools is no worse than the deaths of 
nine randomly-selected individuals who found themselves the victim of gun laws.

Crypto relevancy?  Well, the so-called "gun nuts" have already tolerated far 
more regulation and restriction of guns than we should ever accept.  But if 
we use their tactics, can we expect any better results?
