Wait a minute.  I can see how one needn't be a bank to convert ecash
into pcash, but going the other way requires that the cash be
transferrable in ways that Digicash isn't.

If I withdraw ecash from the bank, it's marked so I'm the one who's
identified if it's double-spent.  If I give the cash to someone else
(different from paying it to them, which requires they have an account)
they're free to double-spend with (relative) impugnity.

What'd I miss?
