An interesting movie out of the 1960's (which is just barely available by 
special order from Blockbuster video) is called "Sebastian."   English actor 
Dirk Bogarde plays "Sebastian," the head of a British code-cracking 
organization staffed by women.  Haven't seen it for a couple of decades.  As 
the opening credits roll, Sebastian has a random chance encounter with a 
woman on the street.  Without any other words, he asks her something like, 
"Spell your name backwards."  In a comparative instant she does so, and he
gives her his 
card, saying, "Call me if you want a job."  A few months later she does, and 
that's where the main story starts.
