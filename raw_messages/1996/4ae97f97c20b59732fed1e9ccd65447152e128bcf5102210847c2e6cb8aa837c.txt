No. They seem to be trying to pretend that the mirror sites don't exist.
They did recently get the universities that weren't served by DT to block 
webcom.com.

This has all been done. First Declan sent an open letter to DT, then a 
half dozen white supremacist groups sent similar "demands."

I think it's reasonable to wait a day for their response. At the moment, 
there is effectively no censorship.

Here I have trouble with the word "we," and what we're trying to 
accomplish. 

Censorship has clearly lost. Germany is simply not going to block 
stanford.edu, cmu.edu, mit.edu, upenn.edu, aol.com, and so on, not to 
mention AFS.

I do not believe that the battle to get people to read and care about 
Zundel himself is ours.

I'm happy to wait a day or two for the routes to webcom.com to be
restored. If after two days they haven't been, then it's time to press 
again. 

I do not want to allow the Nazis to associate themselves with "us." 
Please see article <DM0Fsn.5GC@freenet.carleton.ca> for a little on what 
they're trying to claim credit for. Note they are calling for mirror 
sites nearly three days after they popped up, with no involvement on 
their part whatsoever.

I ain't no part of no Aryan Vanguard. I say proclaim victory now.
