The NYT had an article last year about coming in via the "day boats" to the
Bahamas.  No confrontation with US officials at all.  The publicity may have
caused changes but it might be worth checking out.

Friend gets a round trip tickets from Ft. Lauderdale(?) to the Bahamas.
Meets smugglee in the Bahamas gives him the return half of one ticket (maybe
this could be done via Fedex).  Traveler boards boat back.  Ignores PA
announcement for all non US residents to report to the INS table "A" Deck.
