Bullets don't care that a judge was justified in his decisions, either.  

Ultimately, your repeated argument is simply, "The legal system can be 
abused by those who work in it."  I don't challenge this claim, in fact my 
position depends on its truth; my assertion  is that the current legal situation is 
out of the control of people faithful to the meaning of the Constitution, 
and has been so for a long time.  One of the main reasons I promote a 
de-facto (and unofficial) death penalty for recalcitrant politicians and 
other government employees is because the traditional "checks and balances" 
system seems to no longer be working for the interests of the average citizen.

Any specific examples?  No?  I thought so!  In any case, if "third parties" 
are "fined heavily," that is even more justification for setting up a method 
to deter out-of-control courts.  Remember, freedom is always strongly 
disliked by authoritarian and totalitarian governments; you need to explain 
why the hypotheticals you're describing don't indicate that some emergency 
effort is needed.

I guess you really don't realize that every claim you make demolishes the 
justification for your obvious hostility to a system which prevents exactly 
the kind of abuses you list.  (Although it really isn't clear whether you 
would classify them as "abuses.")

Sloppy word usage.  I think you meant, "incriminating."  Typical for you.

In this day and in this country, "going to law school" is basically 
synonymous with "learn to get along with the current legal system."  It 
should have been obvious long ago that I don't consider the current legal 
system to be worth living with.

Only if viewed from the statist perspective, which I suppose is easy for 
you.  An "efficient identification system" identifies me, efficiently, to 
anybody I _choose_ to be identified to, to whatever level of identification 
I choose to allow.  Nothing more.   Read Chaum's Sci Am article, carefully.
