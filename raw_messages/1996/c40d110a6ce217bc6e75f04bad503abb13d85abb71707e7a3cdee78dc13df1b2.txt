I just brought these files down + a few others in the same directory that
he didnt tell us about (you can see them with netscape by leaving off the
last part. Check out MKCS.PS and others. They take a while to see because
you need a postscript viewer but if you can read them they are
enlightening abot this guys character. It looks like AT&T is in the
key escrow biz, folks!!! Maybe someone should scan them in and post
them to the list, so we know what the enemy is doing.

The MKCS.PS file is about how to make a code for other people to use so
that you can break. And then they say dont worry the government would never
do this!!! Riiiiggggght.

PS I hope this message goes through, my posting software on connectnet doesn't
work so I'm using penet.
