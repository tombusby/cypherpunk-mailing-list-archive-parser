	Bank wire systems over the SWIFT private wire are time synched
    much closer than a minute although I have never been given more of
    an answer than that.

	given that you have a tolerable high speed link, and are not
    dealing with an overloaded concentrator at the telco -> carrier
    inferface or an overloaded server, I believe you can solve most
    of the windowing problem by:

	1.  client sends number and time to server
	2.  server send what it thinks as time to client
	3.  client can place a delta on servers time for local time
	4.  enter PIN, etc. and you are working with a much narrower
	    window.

	the security risk does not appear to increase from the 
    exchange times and entering the PIN and letting the normal
    progression go forward once v. just monitoring a series of
    successive verifications trying to effect a pattern in the
    hash.

	Secure-ID seems to be a one-time time-based single use
    pad; to me, using a time exchange initiator has the advantage
    of a smaller window, and fewer problems with client machines
    running on strange times which require sloppier time windows.
