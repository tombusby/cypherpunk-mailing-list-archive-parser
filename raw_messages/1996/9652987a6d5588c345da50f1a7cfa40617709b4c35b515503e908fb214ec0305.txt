I vote that you don't know jack shit about bomb design.

If you don't have a properly-designed initiator at the core, an implosion
device is just a mess of high explosives surrounding a dense metal object.

Stick to a gun device; it's tried-and-true.  The yield is lower, but at
least it works.
