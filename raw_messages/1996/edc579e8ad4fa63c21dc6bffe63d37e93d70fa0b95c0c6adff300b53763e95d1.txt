This is more of an economic problem than a technical one.  By the
"standard API" we usually mean "BSD sockets", which already has a
"getsockopt()" and "setsockopt()" interface for the application to
communicate this sort of thing.  Adding a SO_SECCLASS to change the
setting from the system default would be pretty straightforward,
technically.

Actually, this is a bit of an "ivory tower" picture of the Internet.
Conceptually, the protocols are purely peer-to-peer, but in the real
world, those end-user Linux boxes go through an ISP.  The User to ISP
link is governed by a contrac, which may specify filtering done at the
ISP.  If you want to access "adult" material, but don't want your kid
to be able to, you should get a separate filtered PPP account for the
kid.

Not so.  If one end of the connection is discarding "adult" packets,
the SYN packet attempting to establish the session will *also* be
dropped, probably resulting in a "connection refused" (from a RST by
the other side) or "destination unreachable" (from the IP module that
discarded it).

Dropped connections don't dump you out of the browser.  You just get
a popup.  (If it *does* dump you out, get a new browser.)

Again, these aren't technical issues, they're social.  A European
company who sends a dirty magazine to a sixteen year old American is
violating existing non-CDA decency laws.

True, but this isn't a problem.  The "validation" is simply a matter of
checking the "information level" in the packet with the "authorization
level" of the user.  If the ISP is filtering adult packets, the "authorization
level" is a constant per PPP connection.  If the ISP is inserting "information
levels", it's still constant per PPP connection, but now the content provider
needs to check if the request is permitted to be fulfilled.  In either case
the test is trivial.  It's not like there has to be a key exchange and
RSA exponentiation for each packet.

Agreed.  But the current discussion is about adding features to the network
layer.

Regardless of whether information is added at the network layer to
communicate the "adult/minor" information, knowingly sending web pages
with adult material to a minor is illegal.  With current implementations,
providers have the excuse that they have no way of knowing that the requester
is a minor.  If the information is added to the protocols, they lose the
excuse.  Again, this is a social matter, not a technical one.

The point about breaking protocol boundaries is an interesting one, and
as far as I am concerned, the *only* technical issue you raise.  I note
that the IP layer's "Security Compartment" option, which is one I've
suggested might be used to implement the censorship, already provides
exactly this "violation".  The "Stream ID" option and "Type of Service"
field are similar "violations".  The TCP layer gives the application
layer the "Urgent" and "Push" flags, which are arguably similar
"violations".

Again, I'd like to emphasize that I think implementing this suggestion
would be censorship, and do more harm than good.  I really hope someone
can come up with a solid technical reason why doing this won't work,
but the more I think about it, the more I think it *will* work.  I
maintain that the CDA is bad socially, but that support for it at the
network layer is technically possible.
