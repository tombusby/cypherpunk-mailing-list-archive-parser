Of course, which is why stores can have "bags will be searched" policies,
restrictions about atire, and all sorts of other policies which are not
allowed in public places.

Disneyland is a private park, and has rules which are not the rules a
public park can have.

Put it this way, "My house, my rules."

One needs to distinguish "rights" vis-a-vis government actions, and the
policies of private actors. The usual point about "freedom of speech"
applies. E.g., Blanc has "freedom of speech," but not inside Microsoft.

Not to lecture, but this frequent blurring of public vs. private areas, of
government vs. corporate actions, of "property rights," is  hurting the
cause of liberty.
