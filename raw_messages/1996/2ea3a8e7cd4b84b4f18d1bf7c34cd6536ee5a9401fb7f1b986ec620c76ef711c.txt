Essentially, adding protective mechanisms that would filter incoming 
network connections (incoming to the O/S) rendering potential risky
connections harmless or rejecting them.  Steve Bellovin has a very 
well-written paper called "Security Problems in the TCP/IP Protocol
Suite" which addresses a number of these.  If memory serves correctly
at this late hour (midnight), then it can be ftp'ed from research.att.com
and it is in the /pub/dist/smb directory (or somewhere around there).

I agree with you 100%.  Eventually, I think the market will demand it and
the vendors will have to begin delivering hardened O/S's.

Good points.  As stated above, the systems should be secure AND usable.

True.  However, the systems can be monitored for compliance to Corporate
Security policies and the non-compliant (read insecure) systems can be
quickly brought back into compliance - frequently using automated scripts.

NOTE:  Implementing a high level of Information Security should be as 
user-friendly, as non-intrusive to business operations as possible, and
as cheaply as possible.  (Yes, it is possible to achieve all three objectives).

I agree with you 100%

Nice posting, BTW.  (And not just because I agree with you).  8^)
