I get the feeling that the "standard form letter" for all such invocations
of AP is turning out to be:

"Suppose you owe somebody money. It is much cheaper just to use AP to have
him killed."


Indeed, this "simple" solution is ever so much cheaper than paying a fine,
repaying a loan, fulfilling an obligation, whatever.

(P.S. The hiring of terminally-ill kamikazes is an old one.)
