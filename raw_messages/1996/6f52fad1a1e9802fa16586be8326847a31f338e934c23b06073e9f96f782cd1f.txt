Russ of nelson@crynwr.com apparently writes:

:"Well, you aren't being
:carried off in the middle of the night by death squads, so I'm :not going to waste my time on you when I could help other people :in danger of death."  I'm not prepared to argue against that :judgement.

I am.

Russ, this rant is not directed at you. I'm just weary of the Bell-bashing.

Perhaps the reason that our society has evolved to the point of not having to fear deathsquads is because of assholes like Bell who keep prodding us to expand the limits of personal liberty and free speech by their rantings.  He makes me think; sometimes the unthinkable, and gives me the opportunity to _reject_ his ideas.

Each time I suggest that someone goes *a little too far,* I draw in the circle of my own protected speech a bit more. *My God, he can't say that!" He _may_ be an adult who knows and accepts the possible consequences of his speech. 

Notice the chilling effect on virtually any discussion when the threat of legal action is suggested.  There's the danger.

Read the entire quote by Donne.  *...any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind;...*  By protecting Bell's right to speak what he thinks, we serve as an example to the rest of the world of what personal freedom really means. *Those crazy Americans* 

Bell gives me the opportunity to say that his pronouncements are antithetical to the best interests of the _inhabitants_ of this nation, not simply the government itself.


Thank you, Jim.
