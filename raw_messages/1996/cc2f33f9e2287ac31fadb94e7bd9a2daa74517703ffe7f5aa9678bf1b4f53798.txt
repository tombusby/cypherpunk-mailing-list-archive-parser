Ease of backup is one of the strengths of CFS which is a cryptographic
filesystem for various flavours of UNIX and Linux.

With CFS the encrypted files live in the ordinary UNIX filesystem 
(their names are also encrypted), so one can backup encrypted data 
without decrypting to make things intelligible and then encrypting to 
secure the tape. Backups take no more time than backups of ordinary 
unencrypted files and don't require any special tools (ufsdump, GNU 
tar, GNU cpio work fine). You backup files individually, which means 
you can also restore them individually, i.e. without restoring a 
whole partition. 

Of course, this doesn't solve your problem, because you are running 
Windows. But CFS might be incentive to also run a more feature-rich
operating system on your PC. You don't need to give up DOS/Windows
to also run Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Unixware, etc.
