Hey man, do they sell "FREEDOM KITS" in American Supermarkets? :-)
ROTFL!

You mean that if... Dr. Dimitri Vulis hires a Mafia-man to kill ya, 
(to silence you) this wouldn't be censorship, since it would not be
"Official"  ? :-)

OK, any bombs thrown in the offices of the Ecological Party are not
official censorship either. It was _unofficial_ censorship by... "Motor
Oil Corporation" trying to stop the Flow of Information (about their
oil leakages polluting the Mediterranean Sea)... See what I mean?

If I own a building and invite you to an open meeting inside this building
do I own what you _say_ or your rights to _say_ it?

See my other posting about why the "Editorial" analogy has serious flaws.

I don't see 'em mailing listes hangin' over the kiosk in the centre of
town, ya know. Nor does the list-ownere make his bread out of 'em. And
finally, we readers aren't as stupid as to forget that we are also the
WRITERS of them mailing listes! :-) :-)

Bulshit!  If this happened, nobody would exist to allow us to express
ourselvers. Even if we build own "Resistance Movement" (or an alternative
kind of Internet) the damage would be serious and irreversible!

Are you telling us that setting up an entire _PRESS_ is fairly easy?

Listen man, it's not. My printer (who printed the boxes for my software)
will tell you this!  He'll also explain why my major competitor in Greece
owns an entire Printing/Publishing house just for Computer Manuals
(Singular S.A.).

Setting up a mailing list is not _that_ easy, but it's still much more
intricate and difficult than accepting the Basic Principles of Free
Expression: DON'T KICK OUT GUESTS YOU INVITE TO "OPEN MEETINGS".
(In the Internet or anywhere else in fact). If you don't like 'em
guests don't invite them in the first place, or don't call your
meetings "OPEN".

e.g. Just as aga tolerates me and vice versa, so should Gilmore
tolerate Dimitri Vulis.
