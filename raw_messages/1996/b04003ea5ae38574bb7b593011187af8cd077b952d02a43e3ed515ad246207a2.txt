I managed to miss seeing the Deputy Attorney General, whose name I will
resist [with great effort] making a very tasteless joke about, but I've
decided to briefly delurk to ask a question I have wondered about for
some time:

Who (an *individual's name*, not a department, please) came up with my
unfavorite Orwellian-term, "key escrow"? I think it was likely a Bush
administration official, and probably an attorney [ie. should have known
better]. I am, as many of you know, trying to redefine the terms of the
debate to our favored term, "GAK" -- although I must say the temptation
was strong to try for "Federal Usurpation of Crypto Keys [etc.]" but I
feel it's important to try to keep the debate polite until they reach
the "cold, dead neurons" stage...

Anyway, I assume this Bush administration official, like David Kessler,
<spit!> is still a government employee -- and I would very much like to
write a polite (believe it or not) letter to him or her, concerning the
origin of the term. I will, of course, report back to the list if I get
a reply.

PS Loren Riddel(sp?) - I am back in south Florida, please send me your
key and the secret word(s) in a PGPmessage.
