What is the 'general nature of truth'?

So in your mind truth is equivalent to law? In the sense of the above quote
the 'laws' that are refered to are general observed regularities that we
are capable of understanding. Being a pantheist and hence seeing the entire
cosmos as all there is (and hence divine in toto), I can appreciate the
original intent (being a physicist helps a little bit).

If I accept your equivalency (which I do) then there is no such thing as
Truth in the sense of the original discussion. The laws refered to in the
quote have the implicit characteristic of being disproved. A characteristic
not shared by Truth.

I further believe the universe is understandable, just not in toto. It is a
little simplistic to believe that every system in the cosmos uses all the
regularities that we observe. When followed to its logical conclusion  it
implies that there may (are) systems which we won't be able to understand
in toto (quantum effects come to mind) simply because the system that is
our brain either is not complex enough or runs into the Godel paradox.
In short, if we assume that we can understand the universe in toto then we
have in effect demonstrated that Godel was incorrect. I have covered the
ramifications of this previously.


Crypto relevancy: many assumptions that we take for granted are based upon
                  proof and 'laws' we ASSUME to be isotropic and 
                  homogeneous. If we don't have a clear and present
                  understanding of the 'laws', the procedures used to obtain
                  them, and the limitations  of both our 'laws' and the 
                  procedures, then we are opening ourselves up for a large
                  dose of security by obscurity.

Always question authority, it is simply another human being who does not have 
your best interest at heart since they have their own agenda.
