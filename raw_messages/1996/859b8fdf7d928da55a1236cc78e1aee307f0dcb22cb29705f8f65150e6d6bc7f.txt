First, I am not convinced that such devices exist in the real, practical
world. They would require either storage hardware or radio transmitters,
all in a package small enough to be undetectable to the naked eye. 
 
Second, I do not think it practicable that the cosmic-nasties (of one's
chosen social bias) could, in the real, practical world, run black-bag jobs
on tens of thousands of surburban garages as a prophylactic measure against
teenagers "playfully" setting up Mixmaster sites. 
 
The software costs of quality crypto approach nil thanks to the terrific
folks who brough us things like linux and pgp. It is, I think, easy for us
to miss the giantic steps forward that these technologies represent.
Imagine talking to an IBM-mainframe priest of not-too-many years ago about
the idea of something like linux; imagine the same thing with an NSA
bureaucrat about the development cost of a security concept/package like
pgp! 
 
Move hardware costs downward and user-interface upward, and Mixmaster isn't
a "black art" of cypherpunks. It is a parlor game for teenage slumber
parties. That's the type of world I want to see.
