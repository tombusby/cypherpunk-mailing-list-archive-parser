	Well, it's either from someone you chose to hand it over to... or
from someone you didn't. In the first case, it's your problem. In the second
case, then you've got a claim. We have no disagreement on that governments and
other coercive institutions shouldn't be allowed to collect more information
than necessary, or to release any such information to an uninvolved third
party. As Hal pointed out, we also have no disagreement with trying to reduce
the level of information that you give out by accident or for the sake of
convenience - e.g., credit cards.
