This method is so dependent on the uniformity of the initiator (the cap 
in this instance) as to be nearly useless.  Normal blasting caps do not 
detonate with the uniformity required to initiate each of the tube paths 
at the same time.  In the off chance that you contemplated surrounding 
the cap with liquid explosive of a sufficent type, (which still wouldn't 
assure proper uniformity with any certainty as the liquid explosive is as 
likely to detonate slightly off left to right as up to down) you still have 
extremely difficult problems to overcome.

All of these might cause enough timing error to prevent uniform pressure 
and thus prevent uniform compression and make supercriticality impossible.

Remember, kryonic switiches are necessary even when dealing with the 
speeds of electric conductivity.  The velocities of even hydrazine based 
explosives are signigicantly lower.  The margin for error is similarly lower.

Plutonium gun is still the easiest method for the home grown nuclear 
device, even if it requires more fissile material.
