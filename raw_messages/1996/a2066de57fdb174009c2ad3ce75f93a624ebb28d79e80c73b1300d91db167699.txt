Sirs:

I must agree that having a website invites unsolicited  e-mail, if 
only to comment that people have seen the site.  I send unsolicited 
e-mail to website owners as part of my marketing plan.

That's what makes it smell fishy.  When I send  unsolicited  e-mail I 
give up the whole deal: phone number and all.  If someone complains, 
I make great effort to never contact that person again.  Either you 
want people to know who you are or you don't.

As I said having a website invites comments.  It's like being a 
public figure.  In effect you are publishing your e-mail address.

Just like all the seedy low life multi-level-marketing jerks!  No 
need to use a remailer for that.

Just 2 cents worth.
