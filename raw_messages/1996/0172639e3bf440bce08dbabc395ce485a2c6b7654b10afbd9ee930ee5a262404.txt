	They're arresting this guy because he had one mention of a Molotov
Cocktail? Why am I reminded of the Haymarket trials? Where's a Governor
Altgeld when you need him? Admittedly, this guy doesn't seem too bright... but
if that were a reason to lock him up, the prisons would be even more crowded
than they are now.
