Sampling produces essentially the same effect.

Sampling a signal of frequency f1 at a rate of f2 produces two mixes, f1+f2 
and f1-f2.  The sum is sufficiently high that it isn't a concern, the 
difference could be.  If you have an input containing frequencies up to 25 
Khz, and you sample it at a rate of 40 kilosamples per second, the input 
frequency of 25 kilohertz gets mirrored down to 15 kilohertz, which is far 
lower than its original frequency.  This is a problem!  

Some of the early voice-scramblers used this effect, heterodyning the audio 
band with a higher-frequency signal and reversing it, changing higher 
frequencies to lower and vice versa.  Not particularly "secure" by today's 
standards, but it probably kept a few people from understanding what's going 
on.  I've heard, however, that with practice you could learn to understand 
such frequency-inverted speech, as odd as it sounds.
