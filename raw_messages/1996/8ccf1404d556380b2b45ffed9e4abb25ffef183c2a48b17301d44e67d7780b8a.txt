        RFC 1984:

        Title:      IAB and IESG Statement on Cryptographic Technology
                    and the Internet
        Author:     IAB & IESG

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering
Steering Group (IESG), the bodies which oversee architecture and
standards for the Internet, are concerned by the need for increased
protection of international commercial transactions on the Internet,
and by the need to offer all Internet users an adequate degree of
privacy.  Security mechanisms being developed in the Internet
Engineering Task Force to meet these needs require and depend on the
international use of adequate cryptographic technology.  Ready access
to such technology is therefore a key factor in the future growth of
the Internet as a motor for international commerce and communication.

This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
this memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@CNRI.RESTON.VA.US.  Requests to be
added to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should
be sent to RFC-DIST-REQUEST@ISI.EDU.
