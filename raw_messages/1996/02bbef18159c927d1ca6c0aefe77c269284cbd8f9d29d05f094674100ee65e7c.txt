Exactly.  I was interviewed over a terrorist double-murder in 1993
because of having used an ATM near the scene the same day.
The fact that I did so AFTER the explosions by which time
the terrorists would presumably be far away cut no ice.
Nobody has been arrested for this AFAIK.

They wanted to know which shops I'd bought what in
so they could check said items were sold that day I suppose.

As it seems nothing can be taken as read in some minds let
me state I had nothing to do with that or other terrorist crimes.
