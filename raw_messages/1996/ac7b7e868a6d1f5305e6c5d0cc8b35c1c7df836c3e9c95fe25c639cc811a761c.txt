what i'd really like to hear/see is something from the prosecutor or 
grand jury in this case.  i'd like to know what they really thought was 
going to come of this, how much of the investigation was pushed by TLA 
types, and exactly what made them think they actually had a case in the 
first place.

i would hope that after persecuting this man for years they would offer 
some reasonable explanations about their (real) motivations and why they 
decided to drop the case.
