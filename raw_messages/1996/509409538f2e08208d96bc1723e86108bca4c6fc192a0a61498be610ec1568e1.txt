But "forgiveness" is highly personal. That you set your personal statute of
limitations at X years does not mean others do.

You are of course free to act on your beliefs and forgive such persons.

I am of course free to remember what they did and not forgive them. Or,
more likely, not give them a job, not lend them money, not enter into
business dealings with them, etc.

(The likeliest main application of data havens are for such things. Things
like "rent deadbeats," credit data extending further back in time than the
"Fair Credit Reporting Act" chooses to allow, data bases of bad doctors and
lawyers, etc.)


Like most laws "banning discrimination," the Fair Credit Reporting Act is a
gross violation of freedoms.
