BS. I am not being that idealistic. look all I am saying is that maybe the
net just offers kids the ability to see a variety of views instead of the
mainstream liberal (or whatever it will be next week) controlled media. For
now anyways any entity that has something to say and can write his way out
of a paper bag has pretty much the same ability to influence on the net (at
least newsgroups) as say Ted Copulate does.

Maybe freedom we have here wont last for long, maybe the Pointcast of the
future will just create another MTV generation...but at least for now we
have a voice.
