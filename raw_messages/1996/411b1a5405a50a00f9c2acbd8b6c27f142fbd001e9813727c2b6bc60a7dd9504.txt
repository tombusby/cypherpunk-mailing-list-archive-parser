Some dumb questions from a citizen.

How do you reconcile this recommendation with the recommendation of the
Cryptography experts group that data which needs to be kept secret for 20
years should be protected by at least 90 bit keys?

The current export restrictions inhibit using strong crypto domestically. 
How do this recomendation free domestic crypto for commercial development? 
Another way of asking is, how can strong crypto be distributed in the US so
as to preclude prosecution for exporting it?  How do future export controls
affect software posted to FTP/web sites?

How do government experiments with key recovery systems help us learn about
their vulnerablities to human level attacks, e.g. bribery?  How much
negotiable value will these government systems carry?

How will GAKed systems protect US business from spying by foreign
governments?  France is rumored to be particularly active in commercial
spying, and will want access to all keys used in France.
