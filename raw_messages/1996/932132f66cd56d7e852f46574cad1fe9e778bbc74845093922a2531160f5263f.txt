A few comments on the NIST draft.

What if we don't WANT to "preserve law enforcement access"?  What if we 
believe that, as individuals and as a society, we would be safer and better 
off to emasculate the government-employed thugs?

Why restrict it at all?

Too bad they weren't more honest and said, "Government employee safety."

I don't believe this.  Do you?

WRONG!  This is NOT necessary in the least.  Just allow free export, period.


>Industry will participate in defining algorithms and protocol

If this system is "voluntary" then why the "assure" part?

In other words, it will shell out stolen tax dollars to willing 
co-conspirators.  No thank you!

 A KMI

Most if not all of these advantages have no need for a "key management 
infrastructure."

I wish they'd be a bit more honest and use "government safety" instead of 
"public safety."

Why, exactly, "must" industry do this?  This whole system is supposed to be 
"voluntary," right?


     There is a more compelling rationale for the government
to be a partner in the development of the KMI. Not only has
the Information Age sparked fundamental changes in the way we
interact, but reliance on information systems makes our
institutions vulnerable to an unprecedented degree.

Aha!  "our institutions vulnerable to an unprecented degree?"  You're 
catching on!  But it's primarily the GOVERNMENT institutions which are going 
to be vulnerable.

> Almost all
>institutions upon which public safety and national security

Yes, you guys know you're gonna get your statist butts kicked, right out the 
door.

(In case you couldn't imagine it, I'm grinning right now...)

No, not a risk to "society".  A risk to government and its agents.

I choose to forgo these investigations and their advantages.

What do you mean, "Voluntary"?

Huh?  If this system is really "voluntary," this last paragraph doesn't make 
sense.


 >    Self-escrow will be permitted under specific
 >    circumstances.(1)

Huh?  What is the word "voluntary" supposed to mean, with relation to these 
statements?

>     progressively as the infrastructure matures.

Why not eliminate escrow controls on all products?


(1)  The escrow agency must meet performance requirements for
     law enforcement access.

Again, whither "voluntary"?

That's simply wrong.  No certification is needed to use public-key 
encryption, as users of PGP well know.

Sounds like more abuse of the word, "voluntary."

"Voluntary"?

"Voluntary"?

What if the user has already come to an agreement with the escrow authority 
that under no circumstances should any key be disclosed?  What if the user 
only gives the escrow authority an encrypted key?

More "voluntary" abuse...

Uh, have you forgotten about "individual freedom"?

How about "freedom to choose NO trusted certificate authority"?

>(4) In addition,

I don't want a "level playing field" here.  I want a free, unrestricted, and 
open playing field.


>Products that meet defined performance requirements and which

But they won't address individual freedom needs.


(4)  A mutually trusted authority is an escrow agent trusted
     by users to store keys and trusted by law enforcement to
     provive access upon certification of lawful authority.

How can I trust any organization that will compromise my privacy on request 
by the government thugs?

Don't bother.  I have an easier system already.  "Free and unencumbered 
exports for all software and hardware."
There, that's easy.

In other words, you want to misuse the power of government to bribe them 
into cooperation.


 With these objectives in mind, and consistent

But ignoring most of the US Constitution...


 the interim policy will consider:
<p>
Prior to formal government-to-government agreements:

>+    Permitting export of products that use an escrowed KMI to
>     approved markets, e.g., Europe or Australia, consistent

What if "the politcies of the destination country" don't ask for ANY escrow 
system?  Are you saying you'll support free export in those cases?

Not acceptable.  How about 128-bit, non-escrowed softeware?  That would be a 
good start.

Maybe you meant, "government interests"?

Aha!  So you're assuming THEIR country's thugs and OUR country's thugs will 
gang up on us?

YES!  Gotta make sure you don't get your collective butts kicked out of 
power , huh?


     The interim policy reflects a differentiation between
hardware and software products, i.e., hardware products with
greater bit lengths are treated more favorably under this
policy. Hardware implementations of products permit more
confident binding between encryption and the key management,
limiting the risk that the encryption can be easily stripped
from the key management and used independently of key
recovery. 

Uh, where's that "voluntary"?

How about "non-escrow"?

In other words, you don't want "honesty" to affect the snitches?

What about requirements that people whose keys are requested be notified 
immediately of such a request and are given an opportunity to challenge it, 
or even better given an opportunity to demand that the key is erased, or 
given an opportunity to FAIL to provide a decrypt key to unlock the escrowed 
decrypt key?

The only way the US government could demonstrate "good faith" is to disband 
itself immediately.

     6.   Negotiate with other governments arrangements for
          access to escrowed keys consistent with national
          sovereignty, national security, and public safety.
<p>
<p>
     As trusted partners, industry and government can share
expertise and tackle intractable problems such as the insecure
operating system. In times past, the cryptographic algorithm
was the core of the solution: now it is the easy part. The
debate over algorithms and bit lengths should end: it is time
for industry and governments to work together to secure the
GII in such a way that does not put the world at risk.


We agree that "the debate over algorithms and bit lengths should end."  We 
just think it should end with complete and total elimination of export 
restrictions.  Period!


<p>
Key Recovery Performance Criteria
<p>
     Key recovery provides for backup storage of a user's
private keys. This backup capability helps ensure the
availability of a user's data even after it has been
encrypted. It also provides for an effective means for law
enforcement access. Key recovery requirements whould be viewed
from the perspective of the individual, the corporation, or
governments that require access. Most of the criteria to be
discussed have a dimension for key recovery on an individual
basis as well as from a corporate or government perspective.
The criteria can be grouped into three categories.


+    Confidentiality - Confidentiality must be maintained on
     all requests for release of key recovery information.

WHY?  If the system is VOLUNTARY....
