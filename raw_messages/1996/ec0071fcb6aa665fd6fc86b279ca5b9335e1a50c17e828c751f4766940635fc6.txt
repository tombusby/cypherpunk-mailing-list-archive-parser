I'll try to respond to some of Tim's questions. Keep in mind it's late; 
I'm about to go to sleep; I don't have my references here. I welcome 
corrections.

Under the original Hatch bill, yes. Certainly under the revised one. Of 
course, Hatch's proposal goes even farther. There's no "sex act" requirement.
Judy Krug from the ALA testified about this, opposing Bruce Taylor.

Even under the original Hatch bill, yes.

Probably not.

Under the Knox decision, yes. (Dancing girls in leotards are verboten.)

If you're in the U.S. and are accessing photos from Sweden, yes. But child
porn laws have been harmonized, so this may be an unlikely scenario. There
is also a treaty I talk about in my August Internet Underground cover story: 

 Not so, says Bruce Taylor, the chief architect of the CDA and a
 professional cyber-scaremonger. The former Federal porn-prosecutor
 believes that "not all censorship is bad."

 "Foreign countries have an obligation to restrict obscenity and child
 pornography on the Internet by the treaty of 1911," says Taylor. "It's
 an agreement between the states to cooperate and to use international
 laws to prosecute obscenity." And to Taylor, books and copies of
 Penthouse magazine can be obscene.

You can be harassed by police for it -- reference the Cambridge case
linked to from http://joc.mit.edu/. I think, though I don't have cites,
that other parents have been prosecuted for this.

Not sure. Perhaps others can help?

Ah. "Obscenity" isn't speech!
