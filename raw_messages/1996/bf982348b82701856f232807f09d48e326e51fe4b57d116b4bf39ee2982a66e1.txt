I was not saying that chain letters are like gambling.  My point was that
they could be conducted with anonymity - like gambling and the lottery.
Your other point is well made.  Anyone have ideas on a protocol to prevent
this problem?

Agreed.  Although I think gambling and the lottery are pretty stupid as well
("The lottery is a tax on people who are bad a math" - from a friend's .sig).

I'm not familiar with the airplane game.  Sounds like a DNC fundraiser to me
;-) And yes, I think there are a lot of stupid people out there (ex. I
started a new job recently and noticed that a warning about the "Good Times
Virus" was posted on the bulletin board).  I'm not sure that the game would
even have to be close to fair for plenty of people to participate -
especially if it involves digital cash and email, which may be much easier
than snail-mailing letters.
