    bingo!  and, how.  they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams!

    I had a roommate at Harvard (late fifties) who had incredibly deep     
    pockets. his mother died his freshman year, leaving him her estate 
    on the tip of Fisher's Island, including the costal defense battery 
    positions and bunkers.

    he had an Apache twin for which I managed to get a license including 
    instrument very quickly --we then went to FI for weekends and 
    built and fired everything you can imagine.  only a few curious 
    paid us any mind as the closest estate to hers was at least 1/2 
    mile.

    can you imagine that today? --the tip guards the entrance to 
    the New London pig boat pens and the LI sound!  

    there were still plenty of professors with both knowledge on the 
    early rockets, and open enough to "private" teach. My advisor was a 
    Nobel prize winner, very accessible, and provided both help and 
    introductions to men most never knew even existed in the vast 
    science complex north of the yard.  most were in the same old 
    building (Pierce) with the RF screens on the outside walls to 
    shield against the primitive radar  --long dark and narrow halls.

    It is a whole different ball game in academia. men whom I have
    recently met are nothing like their predecessors who were open and
    warm --everyone is so "professional" and they are _cold_.

    sad story in general.

    some bright spots though, I guess.  I was rather surprised by
    experiments and their depths in AP Chemistry offered my third son
    by St George's Dixie High School --impressive and not the usual 
    restrictions on "oh, poor Johnny might hurt himself while clowning
    ...err learning."  a) we have better discipline which works; and
    b) we don't put up with those silly whiners (so far).

    but the future does not speak well with declining tests scores 
    which, for instance, require the SATs to be watered 20-30% so the
    median would still be 500!  to think that the pair of 800s I
    received in the 50s can be acquired by someone scoring less than
    650s --what value has the US placed on education?  enough so our
    students now rank well down in the second 10 on international 
    tests!  what makes that worse is the _majority_ of Korean
    students can perform --the lower 1/3 of our students have already
    dropped out of school, and the second third are too uneducated
    to participate.  junior colleges are graduating students who
    would not have passed out of tenth grade 20-30 years ago.

    and, the government wants more mind control --even Bitch's "It
    Takes a Global Village."  at least it's fat chance out here in
    the high desert.
