I keep thinking of different ways of looking at Kocher's timing attack.

(Paul Kocher gave a nice talk at the Bay Area Cypherpunks meeting on Saturday.)

Rich's point above suggests yet another way of looking at this: that a chip
or algorithm that can be "instrumented" (timing measured) is in some sense
too predictable. The chip itself lacks sufficient entropy.

(Before the purists, especially those who've read the paper closely, jump
on me here, I'm not saying adding random delays is the best way to deter
the attack. In fact, a variation of blinding is the best approach it seems.
(Though blinding does not affect attacks which monitor the crypto chip's or
CPU's power dissipation.))

My point, or this angle on it, is that to some extent the mechanistic
nature of the encryption process (such as Diffie-Hellman) can leak
information to an attacker who can watch the mechanistic process unfolding.

This is a result which is not surprising, in retrospect.
