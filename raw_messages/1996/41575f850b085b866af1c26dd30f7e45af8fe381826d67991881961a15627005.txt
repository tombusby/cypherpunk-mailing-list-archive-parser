BTW, check the ftp.funet.fi site...

Somebody sent me a C++ conversion of it. It compiles fine with BCC 4.02.

  NOISESPH.PAS, A Noise Sphere plotter written in Turbo Pascal (23-Mar-96)

  No copyright is claimed.  No guarantees made.

  Usage: noisesph file

  This program reads a file of random or pseudo-random data and plots
  a noise sphere of the data. Poor RNGs or sampling methods will show
  clear patterns (definite splotches or spirals).

  The theory behind this is to get a set of 3D polar coordinates from
  the RNG and plot them.  An array is kept of the values, which is
  rotated each time a new byte is read (see the code in the main
  procedure).

  Rather than plot one sphere which can be rotated around any axis,
  it was easier to plot the sphere from three different angles.

  This program is based on a description from the article below.  It
  was proposed as a means of testing pseudo-RNGs:

  Pickover, Clifford A. 1995. "Random number generators: pretty good
	 ones are easy to find."  The Visual Computer (1005) 11:369-377.
