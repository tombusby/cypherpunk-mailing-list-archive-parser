Oh, come on, I'm sure everybody's read this several times, since it was 
spammed so widely back in February. A URL would do. You can read lots 
more by and about Louis Beam, who uses an AOL account, at 
http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi?people/b/beam.louis or 
http://www.stormfront.org, and so on. I recommend "Leaderless 
Resistance."

If you want someone who would be more likely to appeal to cypherpunks, 
try John Gardner <ygg@netcom.com>; he's a little softer around the 
edges, and he's local. "Dave Harman" never showed up for a cypherpunks 
meeting, but maybe Yggdrasil will. Why not; we were going to invite 
Vulis. John has my number.
