Yet another bad PGP signature via e$pam.

Subject: Re: Digital postage and remailer abuse


That's the third today (although the second was fixable by 
concatenating the Subject: onto one line.)  Would everyone 
please get into the habit of formatting their messages to be 
much less than 80 columns?  All Phil's travails are ill-
rewarded when we can't get basic clearsigning to work via 
mailing lists.  (Or if we don't bother to *use* clearsigning 
via mailing lists, but that is another topic...)


On a related subject, cpunks traffic recently alerted me to how
effective replay attacks can be against PGP.  Don't PGP
signatures include a time-stamp from the system clock?  I'm 
going to get into the habit of including a time-stamp in the
clear-text from now on.  (I have sent so many PGP-clearsigned
messages, and many of them quite short, that an attacker could
almost hold up my end of a conversation using them.  :-) )
