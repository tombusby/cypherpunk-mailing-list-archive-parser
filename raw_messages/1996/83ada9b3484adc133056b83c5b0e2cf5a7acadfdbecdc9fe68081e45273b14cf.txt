Picric acid is 2,4,6 trinitrophenol, easily produced by the nitric/sulfuric 
acid nitration of phenol.

If picric acid contains about 15% of water or more, it is rather stable and 
innocuous.  If it is allowed to completely dry out, it then becomes 
sensitive to detonation with a blasting cap.

One disadvantage of picric acid is that it reads with heavy metals (copper, 
lead, etc) to form unstable picrate salts.

It would probably require a booster...
