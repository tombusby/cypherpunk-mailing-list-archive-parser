I'm afraid that quantitatively, this is utter nonsense.  

A relevant data point is the fact that for about $1000, anybody can have 
1000 copies of a custom CDROM manufactured.  That, by music industry 
standards, is an EXCEEDINGLY low production run.  The difference in cost 
between such a CD, and one made in quantities of 100K to 1 million can't 
possibly exceed 90 cents or so.  While the early days of CD's were marked by 
lack of capacity, it is obvious that if the pressing plants are now 
accepting orders for pressing runs of 1K or less, there is plenty of 
capacity left in the industry.  The extra manufacturing cost for those extra 
titles certainly can't be found in the cost of production.

So how about record stores?  Are you suggesting that the fact that there are 
"too many titles" are somehow increasing costs so much that $8 vinyl turned 
into $13.95 CD's?  But how can this be?  CD's are physically smaller than 
vinyl records.  Cheaper to transport and store, and cheaper to display.  And 
they are certainly not more expensive to advertise!

No, the number of titles available has essentially NOTHING to do with the 
price.  I'm truly astonished that you would think this to be true.

Then why is it more expensive to market a cassette audio tape, over a videocassette?!?
