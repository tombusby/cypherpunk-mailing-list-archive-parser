We have this discussion around here occasionally; one thing it does
is allows somebody to know that different messages were from the
_same_ person, whether that person is using a purported True Name
or an outright alias.  Another thing it does is allows you to demonstrate,
if need be, that you have the keys that were used to sign a message,
by signing another message with the same key, and optionally by
doing the Web Of Trust thing to validate your identity to someone.
I'm not aware that anyone's actually _done_ this in court,
but Utah and maybe other states have laws recognizing the validity of
digital signatures, and other courts could at least accept it along
with the usual Expert Witnesses.

Obviously it doesn't let you prove that an unsigned message isn't from you,
but that's pretty tough without requiring all messages to be
signed with your True Nationalist-ID-Card Is-A-Citizen Key.
