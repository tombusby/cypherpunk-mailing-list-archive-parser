I think the "enemy controled remailer" is an important part of the threat 
model. In many ways it is easier to do than to monitor all the traffic.

True, but it is folly to think that only one remailer would be compromised.

There has been a lot of discussion of this. It is difficult to make slugs 
which can be purchased in bulk (since you want to buy them using 
anonymous mail), can not be used to connect messages from a one person, 
and do not infringe on Chaum's patents. It is not acceptable for a 
remailer to see a message and know which other messages came from that 
same person. If it is ever the first remailer, it knows who you are. If 
it is the last, it knows who you mailed to. There has been discussion of 
secondary markets for the slugs, but I don't think it is going to happen.
