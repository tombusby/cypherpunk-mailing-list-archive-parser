Nope.  When police started to ask the couple questions, they began 
screaming obscenities and generally causing a scene.  Chicago cops, being 
what they are, are likely to arrest someone in that circumstance without 
any prodding.  I'm not saying they should, but they will.

The statement must be considered in context with their conduct, but as I 
said before, I predict no action.

That's because you like dead Presidents.

BTW I read an account of the incident in the liberal Louisville Courier 
Journal.  I guess they messed up and reported the news despite their 
political leanings....
