Dolty is very predictable.  While it looked like Mr. Pat was going to pull
ahead, his spew was directed at him.  Now, that Mr. Bob is forging ahead,
expect Dolty to start ranting against Mr. Bob.  You wait, in a few months
he'll be saying nice things about Mr. Pat.  Mark my words.  This loser is not
really interested in anything factual to discuss.  He is so deathly afraid of
Mr. Bill being sent back to Arkansas, that he would blaspheme even against God
himself, if he was running on the Republican ticket.

Wrong.  You are rarely right on anything.
