Indeed. People make tradeoffs all the time. They choose "easier subjects"
to major in, to take classes in, etc. They join fraternities, they "party
hard," they snort coke, they do whatever they do. (James Bugden will no
doubt claim that I am making moral judgments....no, just stating the
situation.)

And even "education" is not enough. I recall folks around me spending their
Intel salaries and stock options about as quickly as they earned them--on
speed boats, BMWs, trips to exotic locales, and, yes, on drugs.

I opted for the lesson of "The Grasshopper and the Ant," and prepared for
the future, purchasing my stock options out of salary savings and "holding"
on to the stock. Some of those around me probably wondered why I was still
driving my beat up Mazda RX-2 and buying stock in funny companies like
Apple, Sun, and Coherent.

I hear that "The Grasshopper and the Ant" is no longer considered proper
reading material for children, that they need to have their self-esteem
raised, that "I Have Two Mommies" is a more important book for them to
read.

"Feh."
