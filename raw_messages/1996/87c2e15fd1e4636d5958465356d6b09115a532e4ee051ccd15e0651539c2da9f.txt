How much would it be to get a second email address? (Just POP access.
Doesn't even need to 
be able to send mail) That way I could have an address to send stuff like
mailing lists to.

Also: Web pages - I believe I saw something that mentioned that some
space was included 
w/the subscription. How much, and how do I access it?
