	Hmm.... I've got the problem with this that the measure you're using
is really good for creating an _upper bound_ for how trustworthy a given key
is - not for how trustworthy it actually is. In other words, a key that has
your, Lance Cottrell (sp?), Black Unicorn's, and TCMay's signatures on it is
pretty reliably determined (at least to me) as being that of whom they say it
is - but that isn't equivalent to how good the person is at determining other
key linkages. It's an upper bound on how good the person is - if you don't
trust a key as not having been compromised (due to a lack of key signatures),
you aren't going to rate it highly as an introducer.
	The interesting question is what relation to this upper bound (and to
other characteristics of the web, such as the degree of mutual signatures in a
chain) the actual introducer trustworthiness has.
