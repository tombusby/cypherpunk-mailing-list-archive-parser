Electronic Guerrillas: Resisting Net Censorship
THE MUTATE PROJECT

This is an invitation to join a public forum on the World Wide Web on
resisting internet censorship.  By now, you have all heard about the
Communications Decency Act and you know, or should know, the scope of this
law.  This discussion will revolve around active resistance to this law;
routing around it, on-line uncivil disobedience, pranking, hacking, and
otherwise fucking with the Net Cops.  And ordinary political organizing need
not be excluded.

Electronic Guerrillas:  Resisting Net Censorship is a topic within a Forum
called Kulchur Wars.  Kulchur Wars is a Forum that is part of The Mutate
Forum.  The Mutate Forum is a part of the website "THE MUTATE PROJECT."  THE
MUTATE PROJECT is an outgrowth of the book "How to Mutate & Take Over the
World" by R. U. Sirius, St. Jude & The Internet 21.  

While we'd planned to officially open THE MUTATE PROJECT in mid-February,
we've decided to open up the forum TODAY, in response to the passage of this
legislation.

Don't worry.  It's easy to open up this Chinese box.
