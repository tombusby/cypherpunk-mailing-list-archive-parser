 One small thing...

 You are assuming that we will not get the right equasion/code/whatever
 untill the very end.  There is a good chance that it will only take
 half that time...and a slim chance that we will get it with the first
 try...

 (BTW, I have a 486 DX/4 100MhZ That I will put to the effort...)
