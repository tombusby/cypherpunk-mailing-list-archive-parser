Regrettably, I must disagree with Mr. May on the matter of speaking in
whatever language one chooses. It seems that here in Texas (specifically,
here in Amarillo), a local judge informed a Hispanic family that they were
prohibited from speaking _only_ Spanish to their child at home. The
rationale was that since English is the (ostensibly, in this area) Public
Language of the school system here, failure to encourage use of English
would adversely impact the child's education, and was thus a form of child
abuse. If need be, I can provide excerpts from the local snoozepapers
coverage of the issue.

*sigh*
