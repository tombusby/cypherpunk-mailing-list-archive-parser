I quote this text as an example of an ongoing thought process in
the analysis of the AP scheme.  A little statistical mechanics
would not hurt here.  The above example shows *one* possible
interaction between two entities, each having their own charac-
teristics leading to a given inter- action.  But in all theses 
examples, the specific variables that is forgotten is the time
variable.

What will be the *dynamic* characteristics of such a system.

 - the above paragraph describe an interaction in a given 
   direction.
 - what are the others interactions that could *speed up* the 
   above process
 - what are the others interactions that could *slow down* the
   above process

Any analysis of the problem that blanks out the 
probability of occurence (which happens in the time domain) of
each partial reaction cannot describe the outcome of the scheme.

Proponents of such a scheme should stick a bit more to crypto...

Ehhhh...  What can I say?  Physics is everywhere :)

B. Sc. physics
A physicist is a guys/gal that cannot help but see a dance floor
in a crowded bar as an interesting thermodynamical system...
