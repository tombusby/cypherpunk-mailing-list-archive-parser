	For those you want to meet up, I have placed a discussion/message
board on a web page I call the "PGP-Fone Registry" which allows you to
leave a message with your name, area code and local exchange on the web
site so others who then visit the page can look you up and e-mail you to
set up a time and place to "hook up" and use PGP-Fone. Its entirely
voluntary and simply a means to facilitate people finding others interested
in using the application. 

	The complaint I heard about PGP-Fone is there is no way to find
others to use it with. This is intended to help fill that gap if people so
who desire to use it can "advertise," or make known, their availability.

	Please leave your area code and first three digits of your number
in the *subject* header of the message. This facilitates quick browsing. I
will add a small search engine if the registry ever gets very large. 

	The URL is : http://pgp.rivertown.net/pgp-fone.

	Enjoy and kindly report back to the pgp-fone list any good or
problem experience using the pgp-fone application so we can all benefit
from your trials.

	Fred
