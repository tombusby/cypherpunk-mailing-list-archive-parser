   We use them all the time to track down pirate stations and wierd
emissions (spurs, harmonics...).  BTW... If you have an O-Scope that has
X-Y inputs, it isn't that difficult to design and build a low-end, front-end 
for the scope that will provide the same functions as a spectrum analyzer.

   I think they partially do this 'cause the catalogs are so bloody
expensive to produce.  They are an education if you get one.
