Thank you for clarifying my particular problem: what I was worried
about was *authentication* not security. I had the two tangled up.
Duh. 

With an informal email/introducer setup for the FidoNet, we'll have a
fairly secure system with a reasonable level of authentification,
practically speaking, with authentification to some high level doable
on an individual basis. (Using PGP.)

This probably as "good as it gets" in our (email) environment.
