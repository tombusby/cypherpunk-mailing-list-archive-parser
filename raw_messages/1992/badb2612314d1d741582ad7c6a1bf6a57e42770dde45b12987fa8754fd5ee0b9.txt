This particular bit of garbage is so malodorous that it can't be left
unchallenged. There are no rules saying that you can't shield your computer
equipment; in fact, there are FCC rules that say that you HAVE to shield
it, though you aren't required to do as well as tempest specs, which, to
my knowledge, are not even public knowledge.

Put up or shut up, Mr. "Treason". Give us one lick of evidence that you know
what you are talking about.
