:But the user interface problem can be solved.	Just make a bunch of
:.com files which do nothing but spawn pgp by invoking the correct
:arguments.  Very simple; a few lines of C is all.  Even the PGPPATH
:can be set before the spawn.  It's an easy encapsulation.  It will run
:a bit slower for load time, but not appreciably.  And you won't have
:to recompile PGP from the distributed executables.

That's a real good idea. I shoulda thunk of it myself. :-)
