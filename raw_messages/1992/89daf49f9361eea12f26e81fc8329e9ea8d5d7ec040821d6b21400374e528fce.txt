International Paper provides a unique wallcovering that prevents
electromagnetic interference (EMI), wireless electronic espionage, and
other forms of electromagnetic eavesdropping.  The new wallcovering, a
composite structure that incorporates a nonwoven mat of metallic fibers,
has been TEMPEST-tested by the U.S. government and can achieve attenuation
levels over 100dB.  The material, which eliminates the added costs of
"hardening" or adding protective shielding to individual pieces of
electronic equipment, is being used both in primary applications and to
upgrade facilities to higher levels of protection.  It also provides a way
to plug EMI leaks quickly and effectively.  Unlike woven or sheet metal,
which typically require gutting entire rooms, this flexible, lightweight
material goes up as quickly as wallpaper.  No special tools are needed, and
downtime is minimal.
