Our own John Gilmore's fame in the NSA-tweaking community continues.

I just saw John interviewed by CNN for a report on crypto, the recent
case involving the Friedman papers, and RSA Data Security's
problems getting export licenses for its products. The piece ran on
"Headline News," and possibly on the main CNN channel as well (as is typical).

John spoke about crypto and the need for private individuals to have
secure communications, a woman from CPSR spoke about recent threats to
further limits communications privacy, and Jim Bidzos from RSA spoke
about licensing for exports. The NSA had no substantive comment.

All in all, no surprises for any of us. It was too brief, of course,
but seemed fairly done. Reports like this will gradually get the word out.

By the way, you should all check out John's excellent articles he
wrote in sci.crypt about the declassification of the Friedman papers.
If you don't have Usenet access, I'll mail them to the first several
people who request them. (I'd just post them here, but John's in Japan and
I can't get his permission.)
