Digests also introduce a time-delay.  You can have almost-realtime
discussions with an immediate reflector.  

It is possible to have both.  On many mailing lists (such as future-culture
for example) you can "subscribe realtime" or "subscribe digest".

I suggest that even if we don't have a digest, we could still have a
"table of contents" at the end of the day.

You would not need a receipt message, you would just check to see if you
message appeared in the index.
