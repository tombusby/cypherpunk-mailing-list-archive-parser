While using MacPGP yesterday, I thought of a useful feature that (I
hope) wouldn't be too hard to implement -- the ability to encrypt to/
decrypt from the Clipboard.  This would eliminate the need for saving
one's text as a file in order to use PGP... one could Copy text from
any text application, open PGP, encrypt it in the Clipboard, and switch
to a terminal program to Paste it to a host for mailing... or, one
could Copy ciphertext from the terminal program and decrypt it from
the Clipboard.
