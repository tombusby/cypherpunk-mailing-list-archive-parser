Things are not good here. I have to stay and deal with my best friend
Deke who seems to be going nuts. (It's not a new story, but it heated
up last night.) Now, at 1pm, I've gotta stay here another hour or so,
and be back by 630, so I guess I'm gonna have to miss another. I'll
see you all elsewhen (to borrow a Hugh-ism).
