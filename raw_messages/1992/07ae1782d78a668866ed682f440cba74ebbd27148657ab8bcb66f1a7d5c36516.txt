Subject: New feature of the remailer

New!  Just finished.  Fidonet support.  Dumb mailer support.  Incoming
header line pasting.

Here's what's going on.  There are a lot of mailers, the Fidonet
gateway in particular, which don't allow you to put arbitrary header
lines in your outgoing messages.  Previously people using these
systems couldn't use the remailer because they couldn't put the
necessary "Request-Remailing-To:" in the header.

Now they can.  Instead of putting header lines into actual header, I
now support a syntax which allows header lines to be _added_ to the
header on incoming mail.  These extended header lines are in the body
of the message proper, but a filter on incoming mail effectively
adds them to the header.  

This allows anybody who can send me mail with a reasonably unmangled
body to use any feature of the remailer that should ever get written.

If "::" is on the first body line all by itself, whatever lines follow
up to the first blank line will be appended to the header when it is
scanned for special instruction lines.

This new feature is completely modular.  It doesn't (seem to) break
any of the other existing features.  I'll post the source with an
explanation tomorrow.

In the meantime, try it out.
