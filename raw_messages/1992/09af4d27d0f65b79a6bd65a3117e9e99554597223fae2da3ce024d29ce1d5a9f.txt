Ok an IP bouncer is something that runs on a host that basically accepts
connections on one port and redirects them to another specified host and port.
The one below is for tcp connections but it could also be for udp with
a little work. I actually have the code for a 'server' version of this that
you connect to it, tell it which host you want and then it opens a 
connection to it. It's on another machine at the moment which is down.


I had the sent to me via IRC a while ago and have used it off and on. Ive
been meaning to fine tune it a bit as it's supposed to chew CPU a bit...
