I've got Hal's PGP mods to the remailer code installed on rebma.

The remailer is remailer@rebma.mn.org, and the PGP key to use is:

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.0

mQCNAisUI2QAAAEEAKgm07Hsje5KpmXYd5azk0R6AES+qK7LcofnVGojUs7GBghD
WbwrmW8oOEOhRorlShRALKeYspV4xYIw4WDkJcJxuf1B254scz1urF/Eem3zPW9b
yPAx7W/cGwvs6SouZvFcSDq4v1zApvGE9hP4szPzHeGmVr0NVNeaDK0guoCpAAUR
tCBSZW1haWxlciAocmVtYWlsZXJAcmVibWEubW4ub3JnKQ==
=/qHx
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----


See Hal's previous messages for how to use the remailer, or write me, and
I'll dig his messages up.

I liked Fen's idea about bartering remailers.  I'm all for it.
