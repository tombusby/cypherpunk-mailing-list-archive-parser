Thanks for the sites, but after looking at them, I can say they will NOT
build in THINK C. But, They might help me figure out what to do with
Remailer (the Mac version I'm building).  Also, I'm not writing mine
in C, I'm doing it in Pascal, because 1) I have the TCP libraries for it and
2) I don't now C very well at all.
