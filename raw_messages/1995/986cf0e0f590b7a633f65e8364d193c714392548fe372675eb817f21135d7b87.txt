But is this even possible, to make a GAK system "not interoperable" with,
say, PGP?

Unless the GAK system has some sort of entropy analyzer, and can recognize
high-entropy sources which it presumes to be encrypted data (*), one can of
course PGP-encrypt a text file and then GAK the resulting file.

Many of us are already using PGP mostly in this way, i.e., writing files in
text editors, PGP-encryting and getting an ASCII file back, and then
sending. GAK will still have to deal with this mode.

(* On the idea of entropy analyzers. This is implausible, for many reasons.
Any high-entropy file could have the entropy reduced by padding with
low-entropy sources. And there would be "false positives." Some ostensibly
plaintext posts are so incoherent (;-}) they might be "rejected" by such a
GAKalyzer.)

So, is any conceivable GAK escrow system possible that cannot be used with
other crypto programs? Text is text, unless the GAK program purports to
accept or reject the text based on entropy considerations. And I can't
imagine that part of the GAK program would be robust against hacking.

But such traffic analyis is made moot by remailers, as we all know.

What I think we may be facing, if the folks pushing GAK are really serious
about all this, are restrictions on *who we may mail to*!!! For if Alice is
"allowed" to send a message, GAKked or not, to a remailer....

(I can speculate about laws saying only "internationally registered" sites
can use e-mail, but this seems impractical in the extreme...lots of
issues.)

The GAK advocates need to realize that superencryption will be as easy as
it is today to use PGP, and that even traffic analysis will be defeated if
remailers are used.
