A few minor comments on David Chaum's testimony before congress:

...
> As an American who is regarded as the inventor of electronic cash,

The inventor of electronic cash is Mr.  William S.  Powell, who holds
the patent on the electronic cashwatch and whose patent has been stomped
on by numerous and various others because he doesn't have the money to
defend it.  David Chaum's published work was more than 7 years later
than the issue date of the Powell patent.

David's technology notwithstanding, the only way the government can do
this is by eliminating the anonymity associated with cash in favor of a
fully audited system in which all of the transactions are known to the
government.  This is fundamentally at odds with the goal of privacy.

It is unlikely that their decisions will be based on their understanding
of technology - it better not be, since they don't understand it.

The current technology costs about $500 per chip-card to read and
recreate.  No current purely electronic technology is capable of being
used for a larger value than that under any scheme feasible for
electronic money.

This is not true.  The vast majority of effective current technology in
information security is not tied to cryptography.

...

The testimony goes on and on, but I'll give up here for now.
