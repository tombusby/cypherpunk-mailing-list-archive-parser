   In a First Virtual payment-scheme remailernet, no matter how many remailers
   I send my message through, any _one_ operator, together with First Virtual,
   can burst my anon bubble.

Why?  Why wouldn't the FV remailers use settlements?  At the end of
the month, everyone settles accounts in re who gets what fraction of
what.  No logs are needed other than counters.
