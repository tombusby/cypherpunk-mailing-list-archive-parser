Friend, 
 
 
This item from 11 07 95 Edupage may be of interest to you: 
 
                      VIRUS-BLOCKER 
 
McAfee Associates has a new product called WebScan that 
identifies virus-tainted programs before they're downloaded 
and warns the user not to continue.  Security experts say 
WebScan is the first product that prevents viruses from in- 
fecting a computer to begin with, rather than attacking the 
problem after it's already occurred.  (Wall Street Journal 
6 Nov 95 B6) 
 
 
Cordially, 
 
Jim
