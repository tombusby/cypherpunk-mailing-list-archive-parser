The congressional fax/phone list that I recently posted has at least one 
error in it. Senator Rod Grams' fax number is (202) 228-0956. The amended 
list will be available on the auto-responder in about 15 minutes. To get 
a copy:

Send a message to: skaplin@c2.org
With the subject: SEND FILE congresscritter.104

You should get it within two hours.
