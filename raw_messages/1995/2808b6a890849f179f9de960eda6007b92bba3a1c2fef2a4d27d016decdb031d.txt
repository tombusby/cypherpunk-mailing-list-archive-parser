There is no such animal under US law.  Note however (1) you need export
permission to re-export the import, just as if it was produced here; (2)
the company may have legitimate fears that it may have liability and/or
bad PR with the feds under either US or Belgian law if you attempt a
re-export; (3) For all I know, Belgian law may require some US paper
showing what you will do with the stuff before they are allowed to export
it.
