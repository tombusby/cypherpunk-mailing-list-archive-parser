Oh, PLEASE! Do you HAVE to go and mix up two completely
different issues? Aren't the nontechnical people trying to
follow these things likely to be confused enough without your
adding to that confusion? For every person who really 
understands the technical issues there are probably a thousand 
or ten thousand who are just trying to *use* the stuff without 
stepping into a deep hole.

An OS swap file is one kind of hole.  What Siberia is writing 
about is ANOTHER type of hole. If I wipe my swap file after 
each use of my machine and don't know that Pegasus is doing 
this, or think that because of what you wrote I'm no worse off, 
I've been done a serious disservice.

How about saying something USEFUL, like yes or no to the
question of whether sending WITHOUT queueing will make any
difference? How about agreeing that if David Harris hopes to
provide a useful interface to external "encryptors" he will
have to do something about this?  How about cc'ing David?

Somebody else could as well point out that we're all full of 
crap because we don't use Amigas, and while he might have a 
point, it wouldn't be a very useful one.
