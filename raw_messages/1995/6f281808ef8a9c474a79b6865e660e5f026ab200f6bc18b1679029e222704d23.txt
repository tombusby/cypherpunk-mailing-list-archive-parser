Not only that, but the client ought to allocate some keyspace before it
needs it, as I think one other cpunk suggested.  For instance, if it has
four segments allocated and it's done three of them, it should fork a
process to begin requesting four more segments *while* it is scanning
the last segment, rather than waiting until after it is done and leaving
the machine idle until it can alloc more keys.
