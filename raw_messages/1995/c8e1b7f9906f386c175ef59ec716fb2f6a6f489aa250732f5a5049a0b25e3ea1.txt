including

o Lew Perelman, author of "Hyperlearning"
o Andrew Basile, author of "The SPA's Guide to Online Law"
o Morley Winograd, author of "Taking Control:  Politics in the Information Age"
o Frank Gregorsky, former chief of staff to Cong. Newt Gingrich
o Jim Griffin, Director of Technology at Geffen Records
o Don Lavoie, Director, Program on Social & Organizational Learning, George 
Mason University
o Irwin Glenn, Senior Systems Engineer, Netscape Communications
o Pat McKim, Managing Partner, Practical Strategies 
o Cindy Cooke, Director, Democratic Leadership Council of CA
o Dennis Miller, Associate Professor, Baldwin-Wallace College
. . .
What's more, for the truly tech-savvy, you can now pay for your conference
