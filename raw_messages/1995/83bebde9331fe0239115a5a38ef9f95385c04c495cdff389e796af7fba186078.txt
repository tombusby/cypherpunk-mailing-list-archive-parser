The Commerce server is significantly less vulnerable because:

1. Key pairs are generated only once
2. Access to the actual server is limited for hackers to try to guess with
some accurace when the key pair was generated.
3. The time it takes to generate key pairs is about 5 seconds on a
reasonably powerful UNIX machine.  

4. Since the random number seed address space is 30 bits, even if one knew
approximately when the server key-pair was generated it only reduces this
dows to say 20 bits.  Therefore the operation can take anywhere from (2**20
to 2**30) * 5 seconds = 5 million to 5 billion seconds.

5 million seconds = 57.8 days
5 billion seconds = 158 years

5.  We plan to have the patch available by next week

6.  You are right about server owners having to get new certificates.
Netscape and VeriSign will offer new six month certificates to all current
certificate owners at no charge.
