Hello, all -- 

I've a semi-clueless question for the gurus here.  I'm trying to
use the Encrypt-Key option on some of the mixmaster (type I)
cypherpunks remailers, and running into trouble.

Please pardon the level of gory detail here; I'm at a loss to
see what I'm missing, so I present a verbatim record of what I
have tried so far.  Consider the sample remailing directions
below.  The remailer-help documents include very similar
examples.  The single-space indenting is only to indicate where
files are included, and avoid complaints from pgp-aware mail
handlers.

 ::
 Encrypt-Key: apasswd
 Request-Remailing-To: cardtris@umich.edu
 Subject: reply-block-test

 **



The above gets encrypted with flame's public key, yielding a
normal little PGP message.

The block gets 

 ::
 Encrypted: PGP

Prepended onto it, and the result looks like:

 Encrypted: PGP

Trying the above, I find that it does *sort of* work as a reply
block.  If I append sample text and send everything to
remailer@flame.alias.net, I get a reply back that looks like, for
instance:

The appended text, which I expected to come back conventionally
encrypted with 'apasswd', has just vanished into the void.  
Obviously I'm missing something... probably something that seemed 
painfully obvious to the writer of the remailer help file.  If I 
omit the encryption key and '**', I can get reply blocks to work fine,
even chained through multiple remailers.  Suggestions?

   many thanks,
