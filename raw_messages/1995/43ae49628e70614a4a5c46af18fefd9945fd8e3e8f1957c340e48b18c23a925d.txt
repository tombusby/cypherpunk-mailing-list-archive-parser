Sure, they will move some parts of their operations to other jurisdictions.
They already are, for various reasons. Most large U.S. companies are of
course "multinationals."

I didn't cite examples, and won't now. (But you can imagine a few of the
many successful U.S. companies: Sun, Intel, Microsoft, SGI, Qualcomm,
Altera, Merck, and on and on.)

I am not saying that things are as they should be. And I am not a U.S.
chauvinist. I really don't care which countries do well, so long as my
investments continue to do well.

My point was that hyperbole about the U.S. being on the verge of becoming a
Third World nation is wrong. As Sternlight might put it, "arrant nonsense."
