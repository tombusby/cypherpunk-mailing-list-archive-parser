I like this. One complication comes to mind with chaining. You can not set
up the whole chain at once. That would give it all away. In some sense you
are only mixed with other people who build these "chain links" at the same
time. Since you are only likely to build one or two (once built there is no
reason to take it down), you want to build it very slowly to allow many
links to be built out of the machine you are connected to before you build
your link out the next machine in the chain.

Also, if other people take their chains down, you must too, or I suspect
that there will be some information pointing to the only chain not to have
changed (this would only be statistical). I am not so sure about this last
argument though.
