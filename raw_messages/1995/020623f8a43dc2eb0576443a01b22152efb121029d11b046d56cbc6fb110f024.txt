You NEVER claim to have searched space until you have actually done so.

No. The claim is that the server has no problem keeping up with acks.
Besides, if it does, we simply insert a layer of "managers" to buffer the
top management from being "bothered" too often.

You are making the "ACK" too complicated.
Assuming that you are multi-threaded--- Simply run two "workers" on the
same machine. If there are delays in getting keys assigned, the two will
soon get out of phase and keep the cpu busy.
