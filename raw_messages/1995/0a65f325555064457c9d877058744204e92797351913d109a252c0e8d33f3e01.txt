I only have the 1st, but I won't consult it for this anyway....

This sounds like a troll, since we recently had a thread about the possible
use of neural nets in cryptographic applications, and the precise text used
in AC2 to discuss this matter. Very roughly, a neural net is an abstract 
model of a network of neurons in a brain, used in artificial intelligence as
a model of computation. I imagine you could easily have found more complete
information by doing some trivial net search for "neural net".

Well, is it in fact "probably cheaper" ?  If value(crack) > cost(chip) >
cost(attack) then the attack makes more sense....

I think you need to explain more for this question to make sense. Obviously
companies (even big ones) and governments (even major ones) could buy and use
PCs themselves, in the event that conferred some cryptanalytic advantage.

advantages of strong cryptography, now do we ?
