-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
 
I was finally able to read Lance's stuff.  Great work!  Ironically, I
arrived at the conclusion that his methods are necessary just before
downloading my mail (including his stuff).  With that in mind, I have now a
new DRAFT:  model.  I anticapate continued discussions on this matters
mostly under that topic.  Also, could you send me a copy of Chaum's paper?
I don't have metamail, but I can convert GIFs, if you could send it PGP -a.
Thanks!!!!!!!

If Chaum only accepts validly signed packets, she can.  (Or at a minimum,
the government must demonstrate that she compromised these other keys.)

It's called "faking evidence".  It's a real problem, especially if you are a
religious nut with guns.  Or just a nut with guns.  If the government knows
you are using the remailers, and wants to establish that you are using them
to conspire, this is the only way to fake evidence.
 
 
As for hacking PGP, I am convinced that the mixmaster-type remailers
require their own package.  Coming soon.

But padding is worthless if Eve runs some of the remailers.  I know I just
changed the threat model, but stay tuned...

This attack fails if the last link encrypts on the way out, since the
session key changes.  Bob still gets the dupe message, Eve gets no info.
There may be another way to handle dupe messages, stay tuned...

Not if Chaum encrypts to Bob.  Chaum encrypting to Bob pushes Eve back to
Wei Dai's work.

I suppose that depends on the threat model.  If the gov't has control of
all the remailers, she's toast, except for being able to claim that the
message was forged.  Here, she loses.  In all other models, the gov't gains
only the proof that she used the remailer net.  In and of itself suspicious
(some places and times), but presumably _not_ a hanging offense.

I mean the power to spoof a remailer, in the sense of processing messages
for it, possibly altering them.  I admit, with intra-remailer encryption,
this is equivalent to compromising the key.

Yes, but...  If the address faked is nzook@bga.com, then I have something
to be upset about, no?

Okay, but in practice we need a lot of garbage.

Every remailer knows to send Bob x messages per tick.  It's right after his
PGP key in the database.

Each remailer does its own work.  The sum of equals is equal.

But the correlation attack might mean more than just A sending to B.  It
could be B recieves message, then commits act X.

No.  I was refering to your trust in packing garbage on the end of a pgp
message.  If the headers and bodies are encrypted separately, and the
remailers just tack garbage onto the end of the message, you get 12345xyz
one time, and 12345pqr the second.  Match.

Your analysis, as I see it, is essentially correct.  I think that the total
load can be time-dependent, but should be even across all remailers on each
tick.  We need a lot of garbage in the net in order to cover all types of
attacks/foolish useage.

But I said average plus 3 standard deviations.  If you know you are going
to send GIFs at some point, you make a point of setting you standard that
high.  BTW, I envision a tick period of 30 minutes to an hour.

Hopefully, I made my positions on these matters clear.  As I said, I have
new ideas, several of which supercede these.

Yeah.  I realised this right after sending it.  Genius that I am.  I guess
you have to limit the number of remailers in the multiples to 1.  Even
then, you could end up with a remailer-based spam.  (joy)  I guess you have
to, as a matter of policy, allow 1 remailer and nothing else or any number
of others.
