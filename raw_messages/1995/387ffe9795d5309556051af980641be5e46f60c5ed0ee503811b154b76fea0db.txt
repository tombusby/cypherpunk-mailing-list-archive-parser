And the power.  They can filter them out at the level of the mailing address.
Tell 'em to do their own work.  Put it gently and politely, but if they're
the list admin, they can easily filter out mail from specific addresses

to the net much as the list admin is.  "Scenario them rosily with a
calculated ambiguity which they will be sure to understand."
