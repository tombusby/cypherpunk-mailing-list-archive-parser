And you can't ask them to leave, as you send anonymous messages?  Or
does your whole office know your one of those who post to cypherpunks
as Alice d' nonymouys?

	Of course, if the cleaning staff cut your safe open, you have
a good indication of that in the morning.

	Not that you've demonstrated that the level of effort to do
all of this at all equates to what is gained, namely, the ability to
impersonate you.  Which everyone in the world has today.

	Of course, then your message only has 128 bits of security,
because the Greyhound or DHL employee could be easily comprimised, as
could the message in their office.  So you encrypt the pad with IDEA,
getting you IDEA level security, and think you're working with one
time pads??

	I'm flabbergasted.
