Uh, there is a fence around the White House and they do give daily tours.

I might add that there are a good number of people who worry about it 
every day.

I might also add that it is even more silly to design a software package, 
where additional security might easily be added, which has too little 
security to be expanded into other roles.  This is called 'designed 
obsolesence.'  Wells Fargo bank is allowing account transactions over 
their webpage, one assumes this does, or will soon include "cash transfers."

I believe this is a demonstration of your lack of vision, "vznuri."  
Netscape's potential in the next 8-12 months alone dictates that they 
should be concentrating on attracting corporate clients, as does their 
new obligation to stockholders who have yet to see a penny of profit not 
related to speculation and stock price fluxuation.

For now, perhaps.  It seem you would have that limitation written in stone.

I'm not quite sure you mean this, but if you do, you're just small minded.
Why don't you read it again.

There are, they haven't.

Looking at Netscape, and moreover, the entire set of browsing programs, 
you speak like a petty government offical.  By limiting the scope of 
potential of various browsers you do nothing to further the cause of easy 
to reach strong crypto for everyone in a transparent and widely 
distributed package.  Instead you believe we should forgive Netscape it's 
oversights (and carelessness) because it was never meant to transfer 
funds over the internet.  "It's a petty program, you should ignore it" is 
what you're really saying, which completely misses the fact, that 
millions of people are using/going to use it, and they are as likely to 
use it for banking as for shopping at home as for 'surfing.'

Then again, perhaps your intent was never to make strong encryption 
available to the masses.
