Well the DOS PGP.EXE binary should do (no need for source, as it is
uses keysizes greater than allowed by ITAR already, so ability to
increase key sizes is not required for ITAR applicability).  It's 94k
pkzipped.  Front and back print on a T-shirt would give you 80k.  You
could probably tweak something to get it on a shirt.  Dunno if it
would read printed on a shirt.

It would be fun to see what it looked like a sheet of paper tho'.

Anyone happen to have code to do some of these 2d barcoding things?
Or are they all proprietry?

Yeah, I think that would be good anti-ITAR publicity.

The wording on the shirts are: "...is a munition" and "...is
classified as a muntion".  Is that what you meant, that "this shirt is
a muntion" is misleading?

The "has been classified" was wording that Don Henson used in his
earlier ads, but did not appear on any of the shirts (AFAIK).

Joel Furr's shirt says:

 THIS SHIRT IS A MUNITION


Don Henson's says:

     WARNING
    THIS SHIRT 
       IS A 
     MUNITION 


My shirts say:

                WARNING
THIS SHIRT IS CLASSIFIED AS A MUNITION AND
   MAY NOT BE EXPORTED FROM THE UNITED
  STATES, OR SHOWN TO A FOREIGN NATIONAL


I think Raph sent them one of Joel's, so it says "this is shirt is a
munition", rather than "...has been classified...".  Perhaps some
people think that this too is inaccurate?
