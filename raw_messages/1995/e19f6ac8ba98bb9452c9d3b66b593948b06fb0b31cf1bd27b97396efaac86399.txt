A better approach would be to encrypt the entire IP packets and leave the
framing bytes alone.  

But this is what I do:

I use regular unencrypted SLIP (slirp) between here and netcom.
Also install copies of slirp in all your other unix accounts, plus your
favorite session encryption daemon (deslogin, ctcp, ssh, esm, etc).
Then make some script files like this.  For this example I use deslogin
to establish a secure session with utopia.hacktic.nl.

/root/dialup:

#!/bin/csh
dip /root/netcom.dip
/sbin/agetty 38400 ttyqf -l /root/utopiadeslogin &
dip /root/utopia.dip

/root/utopiadeslogin:

#!/bin/csh
exec /usr/local/bin/deslogin ghio@utopia.hacktic.nl

/root/utopia.dip:

port ptyqf
wait ogin: 60
send anything\n
wait d: 5
send password\n
wait ] 5
send \n
send exec slirp-0.9o/src/slirp\n
get $rmtip 10.0.2.42
get $locip 10.0.2.16
mode CSLIP


Add to /etc/hosts:

10.0.2.42       utopia-secure


Then I can do: telnet utopia-secure
and everything is encrypted.

I got deslogin from utopia's anon-ftp dir.
A 3DES version would be nice tho.

When you want to hangup, use this to kill all of the dip processes:

#!/bin/csh
ps -ua|grep " pQf "|awk '{print "kill " $2}'|csh
ps -ua|grep " pS1 "|awk '{print "kill " $2}'|csh


To do this for more hosts, just pick any available IP addresses
in 10.0.2.x and a free tty (ttyq* are usually unused).
