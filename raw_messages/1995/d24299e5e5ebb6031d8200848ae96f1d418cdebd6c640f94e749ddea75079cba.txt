Mr. Zimmerman,
I would like to take this opertunity to publicaly appologize to
Mr Zimmerman (the primary author of PGP).
  In a post to the internet I criticized Mr. Zimmerman for takeing a short
route to legalize PGP short term rather then directly attack Public Key
Partners so-called patent of public encryption. 
  I would like appologize, as I have now been presented with the opertunity
for a business venture requiring encryption of data I realize that we 
don't all have the legal resourses to be maveriks and challenge 
patents. Some of us need encryption now and it's only a matter of time before
PKP's patents fall.
