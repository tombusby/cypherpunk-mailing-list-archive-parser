I feel it's my civic duty to respond to these things, but there's nothing
new here. NOISE.

*sigh* This line gets trotted out every few months here, like clockwork.
You should look for similar threads in the archives. Allow me to sum them up
for you, meanwhile: who cares ?  Perhaps it's because the government and big
corporations have (surprise) flocks of people working for them. Your 
assertion that fully 50% of the posters to the list overtly work for such 
organizations is patently absurd, anyway.

What alternative do you propose ?  Are we merely to chuckle and say, "Oh,
those guys at the NSA are such kidders. As if they actually had any
influence on public policy decisions in the U.S.  What a hoot !"  ?

Unless you can be more specific about this, I really have no idea to what and
whom it refers.

BTW, if not for this line I wouldn't even have bothered replying.

Feel free -- no-one is stopping you or anyone else from creating one. You 
could even announce it here. I'll still be here listening to Matt Blaze,
Jim Gillogly, Derek Atkins, Jeff Weinstein, et al. But then again I've
worked at a govt. lab too, so I guess I wouldn't be welcome on your list
either. Darn.
