   "U.S. Agencies at Odds On Computer Exports."

      The State, Commerce and Defense departments are pushing
      for a loosening of federal controls on the export of
      U.S. supercomputers to all but a few developing nations,
      a move that would put extraordinary computing power into
      the hands of governments that have long been denied it.
      The proposal also has collected strong support from the
      computer industry but has provoked criticism from the
      Energy Department and the Arms Control and Disarmament
      Agency. Advocates of the plan want President Clinton to
      announce the new, weaker export limits during a proposed
      visit to a computer factory in California's Silicon
      Valley on Thursday. [No crypto mentioned.]


   "French Nuclear Program Closely Tied to U.S. Sharing of
   Sensitive Codes, Access to California Labs to Expand."

      Despite its claims of developing an independent nuclear
      deterrent, France has long relied on the U.S. for some
      of the most sophisticated technologies needed to upgrade
      and maintain a modern nuclear arsenal. Although known to
      specialists, the U.S.-French nuclear links have been
      little discussed over the years. Officials are currently
      are trying to negotiate an arrangement under which the
      two sides will begin to share sensitive computer codes
      that describe how bombs behave when they are detonated.
      France needs the data to make full use of access to two
      sophisticated new U.S. nuclear weapons research
      facilities that Washington has quietly offered French
      weapons experts.
