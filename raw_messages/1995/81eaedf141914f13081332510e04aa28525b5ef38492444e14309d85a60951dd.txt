I thought I'd post this here since there is a netscape dude hanging 
around :-)

I downloaded teh patch for the 32-bit windoze version and couldn't get it 
installed.  I had the old installation in the default C:\Program 
Files\Netscape\Navigator (with the space in the directory name), but 
every incarnation I tried, including the Progra~1 8.3 name couldn't be 
found.  I finally just stripped out the old an reinstalled the new.  
Anooying but functional.  Please double check this in any future patches, 
or better yet, put in a seach utility that finds it for you, something 
like "Netscape was found in C:\Foo\Bar.  Patch here?"  If no, then search 
more until exhausted.

Sorry for the non-CP traffic, just trying to reach the right people the 
fastest. :-)
