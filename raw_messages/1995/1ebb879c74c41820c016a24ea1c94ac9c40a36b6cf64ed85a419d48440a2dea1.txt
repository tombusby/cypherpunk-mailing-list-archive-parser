Well, by cryptographic I mean "interesting crypto-type functions," not
necessarily just reversible mappings.  As far as an encryption API is
concerned, hash functions are no different: a byte stream comes in, a
different byte stream comes out.

I ask because I'm starting to put together those GUCAPI function I was
talking about before the new year and defining the initial set of functions.

L. McCarthy noted that I didn't include sapphire, and I've included it
in the (trivially expandable) interface definition.  I'm more interested
in being inclusive than in excluding cryptographicall weak functions 
(and I don't feel that I'm qualified at this point to make the call between
what's weak and strong anyway).
