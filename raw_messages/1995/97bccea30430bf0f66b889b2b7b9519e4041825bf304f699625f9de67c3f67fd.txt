NB's errors and distortions are numerous, but for the sake of brevity
and topicality I've chosen this particular misconstruction of what
I've written as an exemplar.

In my proposed approach, users don't sacrifice one iota of privacy
when redeeming expired cash. When the user reveals blinding factors
on unspent cash, the bank gives the user new (blinded) cash in
exchange. No payer-payee relationship is revealed. This is the same
wrong argument you've made before. Try reading the (very short) note;
this point is made explicitly. I have no clue what Digicash is
actually doing in this regard, but one of their engineers alluded
to something along these lines at Crypto.

It is this systematic distortion of truth by at least two representatives
of First Virtual that has lead to this (highly intermittent) "vendetta".
I try not to feed the energy creatures, but this particular creature
and his minions are literally running around the country, spewing their
lies whenever they get the chance. When they slam cryptography in the
banking community, you can be assured they don't mention their charity
work for Phil, or how they really want to see anonymous systems some day.
