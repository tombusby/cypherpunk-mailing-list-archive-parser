	Amazon.com books (which someone mentioned here a few days ago)
has a free personal notification service for new books of interest.
They also claim not to sell your preferences if you so request.

	They have Springer-Verlag conference proceedings, and books by
Hakim Bey.  I spent a while telling them all about whose new books I'd
like to hear about, and this came to me today.

I must agree that supporting something like that client that everyone wants
to use in their on configuration is not an easy thing. But the are many 
ISP using linux as web servers. I for one would buy a few servers my self.
Its a shame netscape does not make an agreement with someone like Red Hat 
(a commercial linux vendor) and supply a server for use with it. Iam sure 
if they can support a server for BSDI (therefor FreeBSD and NetBSD) they 
can support one for Red Hat (and there for Linux). But this does not 
belong in cypherpuns anymore. Nor are the people making this desitions in 
this list anyway.
