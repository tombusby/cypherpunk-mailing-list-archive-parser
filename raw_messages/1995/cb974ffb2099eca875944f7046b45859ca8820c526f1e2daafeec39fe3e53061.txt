VNM3043 -- MAILBOX IS FULL.

   The message cannot be delivered because the
   recipient's mailbox contains the maximum number of 
   messages, as set by the system administrator.  The
   recipient must delete some messages before any
   other messages can be delivered.
   
   The default limit is 1000 messages.  Administrators 
   can set lower limits if required using the Change
   mailbox settings function available in the Manage
   User menu (MUSER).  The 1000 message limit is the
   maximum allowed by the Mail program.  If this limit
   is reached, the recipient must delete some of
   the messages before the mailbox can accept any more
   incoming messages.

I would very much like to see this law tested. I think it could prove fairly
important to attack it with a well-planned, benign test case rather than wait
for the next National Liberation spam or a death threat. 

I don't live in PA, but I would be willing to participate as the defendant in
a test case under the right circumstances. Presumably I would open an
account with an ISP in Penna., set up a remailer on the account (need to find
an ISP that clearly allows that), and have somebody send a message through it.

We would need to design a promising test case and find an attorney willing &
able to offer pro bono services. 

Any comments or suggestions, esp. from legal types (who of course are not
offering formal legal advice to anyone :) ?  Is this realistic ?  What would
it take to elicit a prosecution for such a test case ?
