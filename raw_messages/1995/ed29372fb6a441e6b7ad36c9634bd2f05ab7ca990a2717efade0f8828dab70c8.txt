  I am planning on changing pine (a mail program on the Unix) to use PGP 
and RIPEM directly, and this is one of the issues I am dealing with.  The 
fact is that if you let someone get your secret keyring and password then 
that is your problem, as both should be secure, esp your password.
  What I am hoping to do is just have every message that is to be signed 
to be signed with the thumbprint (hash?) of the message, and this will be 
put at the bottom of each message, every time, so that it protects from 
any messages being changed, and verifies who sent the message.
  Again we go back to the fact that the weakest link here is *you* not 
PGP.
  Take care and have fun.  BTW: Once I am done this version of Pine will 
be export controlled it sounds like. :(
