Absolutely.  And why not enter the PR fray by publicizing those 
successes?  Press release/identify persons for followups/etc.  (All with 
permission/participation of those who did it).  

Certainly, Cypherpunks has gotten press lately, and what I've seen has 
been good press.  Capitalize on it.

Finally, I've got to say that, as someone new to the concepts discussed 
here, I found it extremely cool to read about the latest break here and 
then see it in the news a day or two later.
