		  	FREE NEW YORK WORKSHOP

	     DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE AFTER July 22, 1995

______________________________________________________________________

What: 	A free workshop on current online censorship legislation and
      	the viable alternatives.
When: 	Saturday July 22nd, 1-4pm
Where: 	ACLU offices at Times Sq (132 West 43rd St at 6th Ave)
Who:	Everyone (teachers, librarians, businesses, everyone!)
Agenda:	
  Crash Course on the First Amendment and the New Censorship Legislation 
  Questions and Answers About How the CDA Affects You and Your Business 
  How to Lobby Your Representative 
  Plans for the New York Lobby Day Against the CDA:  Wednesday, July 26th 

______________________________________________________________________
WHY YOU SHOULD ATTEND THE WORKSHOP

Are you interested in seeing our government become less intrusive, not
larger, and less involved in personal decisions about what you read?

Do you believe that Constitutionally-protected speech should not be
regulated by the FCC (or any other Federal agency)?

Do you believe that computer networks are a tremendously powerful tool
for giving many more people in our society a voice, bypassing traditional
forms of media?

If you find the above three questions compelling, you should be
concerned about the 1995 Communications Decency Act (CDA).  Having
already passed the Senate, the CDA is headed for the House and has
favorable odds of passing there as well if nothing is done.

The CDA was passed by the Senate 84-16.  It was voted on by many
legislators who not only never use a computer, but have never read
email, logged onto a BBS, read Usenet news, or seen a Web page.  They
were simply voting with their gut reaction, unaware that they were
disastrously affecting the future of American expression and the
most explosive industry seen in the last ten years.

It *doesn't* have to be that way.  We as New Yorkers can't expect our
elected officials to vote out of a vacuum.  We need to tell our
Representatives that online systems are a new medium, not the same as a
telephone, nor the same as television.  They need to understand that
the Internet and bulletin boards aren't simply Dial-A-Porn lines, or
adult cable channels.

However they won't come to these conclusions themselves; they need your
help.  Come to this free workshop and learn what you can do to help
ensure that online communication isn't restricted unreasonably.
