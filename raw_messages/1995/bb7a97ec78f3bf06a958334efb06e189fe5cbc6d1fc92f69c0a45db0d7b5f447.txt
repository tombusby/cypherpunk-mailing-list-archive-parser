	For the last time: I have nothing to do with Netscape. So, please,
stop making silly associations. What I do to defend my opinions it to try
and get more people involved in the subject, explain the problems in terms
they can understand, discuss with them about possible solutions (sometimes
they have better ideas than me) and try to promote an effective course of
action. And in any case that's *my* business.

	Being in a different country and even continent, what I do may not
be of any direct consequence to you. And since I have nothing to do with
any commercial company -hey I don't even use Netscape- it has no relationship
whatsoever with Netscape or any other company.

	If you think that people likes to hear complains, go along. In my
experience people is more cooperative when they see better solutions than
just making a boicott and renouncing to use things they like. So, I'll 
keep on explaining what crypto can do for them and how easy it is to be
taken advantage of. And how easy it is for them to press and get what they
deserve.

	WRT legal courses of actions, just remember there's a whole world
our your privy. It's sad you don't know better, but if you look around
carefully you'll discover that many of the proposed actions are not feasible
in many places. Just go out of your shell.

	I haven't either. I wouldn't be here if I did.
