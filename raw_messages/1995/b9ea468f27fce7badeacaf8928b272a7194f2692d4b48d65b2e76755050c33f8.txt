This may open up some interesting Freedom Of Information Act
possibilities for Raph, (but IANAL). A FOIA request usually isn't
very fast, but they can be interesting, and even (occasionally)
funny. Raph's situation sounds promising, if my hypothetical FOIA
isn't squelched by the "national security" exception. This seems
unlikely, if Tim is correct about the shirt's machine-unreadability.

Members of the legal community, including judges, are sometimes
known as "humor-impaired" regarding the many laws that clearly
*are* jokes to many people. Generally the "crimes" mentioned in
these laws have no individual victims -- see Abe Lincoln .sig
quote below.
