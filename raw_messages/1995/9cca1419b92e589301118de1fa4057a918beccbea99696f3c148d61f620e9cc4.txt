This is not completely correct; there is a degree of anonymity in
DigiCash's ecash.  That is anonymity of how a person spends his money.
Neither the bank nor the payor is in a position to learn who or where a
particular piece of ecash comes from (assuming that anonymous
communication means are used).

This is not trivial anonymity.  IMO the greatest privacy threat posed by
credit cards is exactly this, the tracking of spending information and
patterns.  With credit card payments a great deal of information can be
learned by the credit card company about what I do.  With ecash almost no
information is learned, only the raw amounts I spend.  And if I occasionally
make payments to myself even that is blurred.

Ecash is not all that we might hope it could be but it is more than a
myth that it allows untraceable transactions.
