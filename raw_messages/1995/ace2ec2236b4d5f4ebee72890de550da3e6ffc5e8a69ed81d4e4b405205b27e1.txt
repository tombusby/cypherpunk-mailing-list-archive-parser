Supposedly, the congressional pur$e-$trings...

I have mass-forwarded Dave Banisar's post to all the media
e-mail addresses I have. I suggest that everyone on the list
do this too. [Isn't e-mail wonderful?  :) ] I also e-mailed
the government asking which position was the lie, but I don't
expect a response.

Yup. I'm afraid our best hope [aside from the media]
is Congressman Trafficant and his ilk.  ;-)

When combined with PRZ's award today, I feel this obvious
lie could be a blessing in disguise for us privacy lovers.
I say this in view of the timing of the upcoming political 
season, but everyone here already knows that I only trust
one kind of candidate to tell us the truth.
Now they know why...

Don't investigate Mena, Arkansas and contra-coke. 
Embarrassment is a threat to national security...
