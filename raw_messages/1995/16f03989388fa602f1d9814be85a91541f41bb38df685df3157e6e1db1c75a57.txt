I'm joining this a bit late, but if you take the concept
proposed earlier about sticking a remailer stamp on each
encrypted envelope and that stamp being removed by the
remailer, each remailer will get paid for handling the
message.

The anonymity (assuming an FV-type postage sale) can be
restored by having one or more trusted postage exchanges.

You buy a hundred stamps, send them to the exchange, and
get back ninety-nine stamps from a pool.  You now have a
valid remailer stamp that does not have a link to you.

Of course, to keep the purchasers honest, the stamps should
probably be send from the purchase point (FV in this example).
And there would also have to be a fast clearing house so
stamps can't be reused/copies.
