Again, you miss the point.  Again, you twist the issue.  I didn't say they 
were actively supporting GAK.  I said they were not opposing it with 
anything like vigor.

Show me now where I assert that "they are really supporting GAK."

I see.  You cannot say that I said that, so you simply assert it?

Uh... sure buddy.

Let's not forget something here.  Netscape is not removing itself from 
the role of crypto developer.  Quite the reverse.  They have purposefully 
included crypto in their product.  They claim to be for strong crypto.  I 
want to see more than words on that point.

When I said waiting for someone else to do something was useless, I was 
refering to Netscape's "allow others to oppose GAK actively while we do a 
lot of hand wringing" attitude.

You, unlike me, are willing to let that be enough.  I will believe it 
when I see it.

This basically amounts to "at some point in the 'near future' I will tell 
you what we will do in the 'near future after the near future.'"

Why do you feel you must sit on your hands and wait for the world to 
decide your fate for you?

Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Clark (I would hope) have some infulence in these 
matters.  They have not (as far as I have seen) demonstrated to anyone 
that they have thought about them much.

What precisely is it about my free-speech urges and taunt to energize 
them that frightens you?

Am I too loud for your taste?

Does the frige humming at night disturb you?

I would much rather try to get them to write the damn policy statement 
right in the first place than have to try and CHANGE a poor and intrenched 
policy once in place.

Clearly you have not done much of this kind of work in business or 
government before.

Again, you have missed the target, and the barn.

I don't care about contradictory statements as much.  I care about a lack of 
demonstrated effort.  I have pointed to the absence of any single fact or 
statement that shows Netscape is really interested in trying to derail 
GAK, or promote strong crypto in anything like an active way.

  I will admit that Jim Clark was somewhat

And it is in my interest, and in my view everyone's interest, for him to 
be less than neutral, and instead quite violently pro-strong-crypto and 
anti-GAK.

It's called 'persuasion.'

No, I asked why ONLY clarification, and NOT modification.  Try reading

My heart goes out.  Today they have resources, let's see some action.

No, they have hired a 'government liason person.'  No one has explained 
with any detail what that means.

Perhaps, perhaps not.  I have no idea.

Netscape has been nicely funded for quite a while in Washington business 
days.  A lot happens there in the time they have been loafing.

  Given point C, I see they

Uh... sure... and 0 + 1 is still only 1.

Show me some serious effort.  Name this expert lobbist who doubtlessly 
has a sparkling reputation.  Why was an individual and not a firm hired?

Point D is of no real import to me.

So.  We have one guy in washington, (maybe, is he posted in washington?) 
and a lot of excuses.

Adds up to:

"Bovine excrement."

I am more concerned about what Netscape is NOT doing.  How this has 
anything to do with what the lawyers (none of whom to my knowledge are 
lobbists) think?

A cute speech.  Still doesn't change the fact that a little fluff seems

Netscape was never my ally.  They looked like a company worth investing 
in.  For the time I held stock, they were.  Their morass on this issue, 
and my general dislike for overhyped firms, made the investment less and 
less worth it to me.

Netscape did about what was par for the course, include crypto in a 
product that is likely to be used for financial information.  You think 
this is some great accomplishment?

You only strengthen my view that you are easily impressed.

I don't CARE what Netscape's past is.  I care what Netscape is doing with 
the signifcant power and voice they have.  I wonder if Netscape is 
selling out.

Now you need to read your answers more carefully.  Look up 11 lines.

  I am saying that they have only said that they will go to GAK
> if the choice is between GAK crypto and no crypto.

Read a few more lines up, where you say you don't think Netscape is 
rolling over.

  To the best of my

In fact they have said very little of anything.  This is the point.


Again, what rises to the level of an 'anti-GAK' position in your view 
astounds me.  "Well, they didn't say they would implement GAK unless they 
had to."

"Well, I'll stop all this drug trafficking if anyone tells me I have to."

  I think that this is reasonable, I do

Boy, sure seems like your ready to come out swinging!  But let's wait a

And what have they done to oppose it precisely?  Show me something 
besides 'send a man down' or 'appoint a committee' or 'consider the issue 
for a pending policy release.'
