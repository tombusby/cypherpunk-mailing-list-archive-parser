	That's not really a solution in the Windows environment, if you have a 
swap file, you never know what gets written out to it.  The solution is 
run w/o a swap file or run an encrypted file system.  I run an 
encrypted file system.

	Pegasus will indeed save your key with your message in the outgoing 
queue.  This is a problem with the design of pegasus, not with the 
design of the add on encryptor.
