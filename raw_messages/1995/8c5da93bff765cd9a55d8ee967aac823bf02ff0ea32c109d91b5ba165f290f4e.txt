I also disagree because I would interpret it as "It shall not be 
unlawful...to intercept, disclose or use that communication...except 
by utilizing *service observing* or *random monitoring*." That indicates 
to me that specific monitoring is fine, but random monitoring must be 
used for quality control. And how do you become specific without being 
random? QC could be whatever the providers deem it to be, the public 
be damned.

"..anything not specifically allowed is expressly forbidden..."
