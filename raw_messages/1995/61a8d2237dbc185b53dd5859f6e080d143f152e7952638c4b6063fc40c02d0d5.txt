        How about one of the Middle Eastern countries? Saudi Arabia would have
been good until recently, but they've just signed the Berne Convention on
copyrights...so there's one down. On the plus side, the authorities haven't
banned crypto yet. Why? One only wonders.
        Kuwait has ready-made Internet access, but is, if I'm not mistaken,
also a signatory to the international copyright convention. Both Kuwait and
the KSA are also very friendly with the U.S., though I cannot name any
specific case of extradition between the two countries. Given the choice
between a Saudi court and a U.S. one, however, I'd pick the U.S. :-)
        Why not Yemen, Oman, or Lebanon? We'd have to start an ISP by
ourselves, but the countries are small enough...or just recovering from civil
war...such that nothing would be noticed(fingers crossed). Oman has CISnet
access...maybe something could be built on that. For Yemen or Lebanon, we'd
have to get a satellite hookup(which presents its own problems).
        Besides, Oman has simply _beautiful_ scenery. :-)

        In theory. To actually set up a data haven takes more resources than I
have. IMHO, however, one of the smaller Middle Eastern countries would be
good, as they generally don't(unless I'm mistaken) have reciprocal copyright
treaties with the U.S., are not generally signatories of the Berne Convention
(except KSA and the UAE and maybe Kuwait), and do not look likely to outlaw
crypto. 

Thoughts?
