It needs to be more complicated than this, however, because if just a
font is used then each 'e' looks like every other--easy to detect.

Interesting.  I've not heard of this.  The situation bears a great
similarity to stego--you need to emulate a statistical pattern to
make it undetectable, and if your opponents statistics are more
sophisticated than yours, you'll be found out.

Then again, what are the chances that Congressional staffers will be
using such sophisticated methods to sort out the 'astroturf'?  If
a staffer is suspicious but then sees "recieved" and "I been" and
"heplful" and decides, "Okay, this was written by a human," well,
that's Good Enough for Government Work, as they say.
