Actually, he did a pretty good job of towing the er, party line. Lots of
good opportunities for analogical heavy lifting in arguments with statists.
"Suppose you had a very strong door which protected your whole house and
made it inviolate. Suppose then the government then wanted to have copy of
your door keys on the off-chance you turn into a crack dealer someday...",
etc.

Except for the fact that he wants Uncle to protect his patents, that is...
;-).

This was done on December 8 at the Commonwealth Club in SFO.  Were there
c'punks there? The questions sounded like it...

He also said something about some kind of magic badge with biometric/PK
software which would allow you to work anywhere there was a network
connection. Reminiscent of our discussions about Xerox PARC's ubiquitous
computing stuff, Gerry O'Neil's 2081, etc.

I feel a rant coming on about this "information toaster" stuff, Metcalfe's
fight with Alsop in Infoworld, etc. Guess I'll start it tomorrow. Take
cover everybody...

Merry Christmas!


Cheers,
Bob
