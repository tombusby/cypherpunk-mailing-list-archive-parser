I saw a new cordless phone made by Motorola in a retail outlet today
that is supposedly "Secure from eavesdroppers."  I asked the
salespeople for more technical info, but they weren't very helpful. 
Does anyone have any information on this?  I didn't notice any "Not
for Export" stickers on the box, and the ITAR does cover
spread-spectrum technology.  So is it analog or digital?  Is it just
doing simple analog tricks, or is it encrypting a bitstream?  Clipper
maybe?  I doubt it.  Any info appreciated.
