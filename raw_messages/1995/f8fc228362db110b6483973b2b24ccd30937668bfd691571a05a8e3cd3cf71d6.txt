I agree and disagree. ;-)

The "internet terminal", or "internet appliance", as it is sometimes called,
is IMHO, worthless. Would you write and send e-mail if you had no way of
archiving it? Would you use "net-quicken", if it required all your data to
be stored on a shared disk at Intuit? (There was an interview on NPR 11/17
where this was touted as "the next big thing"!)

On the other hand, I believe that a <$1000 computer would be a big seller.

with three digits left of the decimal point, even if they're all nines :-)
The tough part is making it usable, and making some money on it.
[ I've got this 386-40, with 1 MB RAM and a 40MB hd, see... ]

Actually, I think the plan is to boot from ROM.

I agree.
