All that is extremely fine and an awaited initiative BUT for one point
   the EXTREMELY SHORT DELAY and notification!!!!!!


Our company is just in the "joining the consortium" process,
   especially because we were expecting such an event.

However, to be able to catch a flight and spend a couple of days at MIT
  within less than a fortnight is another matter.

I don't yet know if we will able to attend, and we really would
hate to be unable to attend and participate.
Thus I  would urge the Web Consortium to consider postponing this meeting for
at least 2 or 4 weeks so that any interested party is able
to decently cancel other commitments and get prepared for the meeting.
If W3C is really interested in attracting all interested party,
it would be fair as I suspect we are not the only ones with

Please let me know as soon as if this is possible or if
I must as soon as possible try to change my agenda.
