Probably not as easy as Carl's.

Assuming Carl is using Mailcrypt under Emacs (as he suggests above),
then he doesn't have the same problem.  When the signature fails to
verify for lack of a key, Mailcrypt will parse the PGP output and
offer to fetch the needed key automatically (and instantly) via HTTP
to the keyservers.

But then, Emacs only runs on "ghettoized" operating systems like Unix,
VMS, OS/2, and Windows 95...
