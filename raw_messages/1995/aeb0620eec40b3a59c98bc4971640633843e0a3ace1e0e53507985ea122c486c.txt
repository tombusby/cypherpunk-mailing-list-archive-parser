One of the major features of the Uraguay round of the GATT (General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) is a large revision of internation patent
and copyright law (which is currently de facto non-existent in many 
countries).  Intellectual copyrights are still somewhat vague in the
current agreement, but there will be a course for hearing through the
WTO (World Trade Organization).

In the case of Asian countries, APEC (Asian Pacific Economic Conference)
is laying out intellectual property right regulations for conference 
members (the US, Canada, and most of the Pacific Rim including China).
Though these agreements are still a long way from clearing up copyright
disputes and their enforcement remains dubious, they should help to 
stop such blatant infractions of copyright status.

Of course, one need not look to China for copyright violations, just take
a look at all the video tape pirates in New York or other cities ...
