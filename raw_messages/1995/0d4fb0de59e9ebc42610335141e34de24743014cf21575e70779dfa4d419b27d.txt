cpunks,

i was thinking about the recent Clinton/LEA proposal regarding exportable 
crypto.  the new rules would allow 64 bit keys to be exported, as long
as the master key was made available through some key escrow service.

now, we know it is relatively easy to break a 40 bit key.
additionally, we know it is nearly impossible to break 128 bits.  i'm
not so sure how hard 64 bits is (need to brush up on that ol'
mathematics some time...).

why did the govt pick 64 bits?  is this length still within the range
of the NSA if they really wanted to read something but didn't feel the
need or want the exposure of obtaining a key from escrow?

i'm curious if anyone thinks this gives us a little more info on the
capabilities of the NSA regarding brute forcing a key.  additionally,
since this *is* an escrow system, why didn't the gov't just go with
the unbreakable 128 bit key length?
