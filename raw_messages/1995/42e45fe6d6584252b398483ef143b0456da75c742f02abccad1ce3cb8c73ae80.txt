No surprise; it's a tough job.  I don't expect my laptop to be
continuously on-line when I'm reading mail, and even on-line use
needs to be more realistic than saying "Everybody must use X.400".

Interesting.  Aside from the excessive cost of looking up cards in paper
booklets,
which can be avoided by having checkstands validate on the store's backroom
computer system, on-line verification lets the card company not only
refuse stolen cards, but also dynamically refuse cards that have reached
their credit limits, which you can't do on a slow push-based offline system.

However, it's _very_ tough to spoof a credit-card verification system, 
because the checkout device uses phones or private networks to reach the 
authorization company, so the response that comes back saying yes/no/stolen
can be real dumb.  On the internet, the response needs to be signed,
though I suppose it could say "Key sssss at xxx@yyy.zzz authorized
key uuuuu today yyyy/mm/dd/hh:mm:ss, valid for up to $500", and you'd then have
to validate the key that signed it, etc....  On the other hand, you could
have the cert require multiple confirmations, e.g. both the bank and the
user have to authorize this use.

OBJECT IDs solve two problems - one is that you need some kind of format (yuk),
but the other is that fields to have mutually agreed on values to be meaningful,
and central registration is an easy way to implement it, as long as there's
a simple way to register things.  I hope it at least supports an OBJECTID
with parameters, e.g. "CreditLimitUSDollarsBankFoo integer"  rather than needing
excessively many OBJECTIDs "CreditLimit3700USDollarsBankFoo"?  As you say below,
there's certainly no need to use ASN.1 formats instead of readable ones...

Yeah.  I've decided, as an experiment, to start signing keys for pseudonyms,
though I haven't settled on how to deal with unauthenticated signatures
for realspace people (in the one case where I've been asked, the person
didn't have any independent signatures from other people, so so far I've
declined,
but I may re-evaluate and just do uniqueness.)
