Remailer messages sent via remailer@ideath.goldenbear.com to 
remailer@rebma.mn.org are failing; the system which handles my
mail upstream can't seem to connect to rebma. I'm going to try
to get things ironed out, but until then the ideath -> rebma path
should be avoided.

Sorry for any inconvenience; the bounced messages have been
discarded.
