that depends on what you think of as "internet-ready", IMHO.  OS/2 is 
ready to fail in an endeavour to be what UNIX has been for over 25 
years:  a _truly_ internet-friendly, multitasking, multithreading OS.

really?  I would think over a decade of Japanese technical superiority in 
automaking (better gas mileage, better safety features, etc.) and the 
resultant move by the "Big 3" to be even more technically superior would 
tend to contradict that notion.  Consumers are not totally stupid - they 
may drool over and rave about the latest flashy, technically inferior 
car, but when it comes down to it they'll most often buy the one with the 
best gas mileage, the best safety features, and so forth.
