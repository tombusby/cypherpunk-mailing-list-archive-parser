Consider the incoming directory on my local news host:

--
jlc:/usr/spool/news/in.coming$ ls -l
total 401

The majority of incoming messages are two days old (this was on Feb 1 at
16:10, GMT -7); the worst instance in this particular batch was six days
old (posted from a backwater site in Sweden).

Before you object that this is obviously a poorly-connected site, we're
on a leased 56K line two hops from the backbone (we're fed by BYU, who
is in turn fed by the University of Utah, one of the original four
internet sites and as well fed as you get). Our server is keeping up
with the incoming news. I suspect this is a pretty typical scenario.
