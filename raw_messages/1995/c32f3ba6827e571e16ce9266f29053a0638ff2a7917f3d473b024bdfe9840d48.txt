As a _very_ low profile member of this list I thought a futile gesture
was needed at this point:
                        *I agree with you*
I've been trying to interest the  BBC in the U.K. in pgp, clipper et al 
for ages - I give up!.- BTW- after 'Britland' MPs posted hear a while back
I thought _maybe_ we'd hear more.Will the last one to leave Grate Britain
please switch out the lights!
