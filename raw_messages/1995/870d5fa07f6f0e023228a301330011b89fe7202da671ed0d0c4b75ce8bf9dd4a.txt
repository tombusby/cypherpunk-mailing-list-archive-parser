well well well,

our anon friend flames away with 'shut up' 'shut up' 'shut up'.  aint 
free speech nice.

it's so nice to see the remailers put to such good use!  if you are going 
to post flames and worthless commentary the least you could do is sign 
the mesg so we can killfile you.

mr. anon, perhaps you've noticed that the govt pretty much does what they 
want.  in this instance we have the chance to have some influence (albeit 
minor) on what the outcome is.  or, perhaps you're just some TLA stooge 
sent to disrupt our plans to take over the world.  

i suppose you think we should just tell the govt to 'shut up'.  yup, that 
will do the trick.  they'll just say, 'gee, sure.  sorry we tried to take 
away your privacy.  our fault.'  right.  the govt would prefer a nice 
docile populace that goes to work and pays their taxes without talking 
back.  

in any event, this isn't the first grade.  we don't tell people to 'shut 
up'.
