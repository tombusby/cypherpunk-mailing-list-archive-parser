I'm posting this again, not because I think it contains any
particularly profound insights, but rather because I initially
sent it around midnight last night and it was not reflected
here so I suppose it did not make it out.

The use of terms such as "virus" and "hacker" in a context such
as this has little or nothing to do with what the terms actually
mean.  It's palpably obvious that they are being bandied about
here solely for the knee-jerk emotional reactions they evoke.
Even those more computer/net clue-impaired than Grassley (assuming
that such is possible) know from watching TV and the movies that
a virus is a Bad Thing (tm) and that hackers are evil!
Pseudo-digital demagoguery.

Or simply kidnap him and escort him back to the U.S.

It might be even more beneficial if Senator Grassley and the other
members of our august deliberative bodies would meet the internet.
My gut reaction to the recent tide of legislation is that they are
seeking to stangle what they fear and that they fear what they do
not understand.  (Too melodramatic?)

You don't recognize them because they are masquerading 
as "virus hackers".

Again, the main reason for playing the "terrorist" card is
for the emotional hot-buttons they can push by so doing.
Since Grassley didn't use it, look for someone to introduce
something this session titled, "The Avenge Those Poor,
Innocent, Bloody Dead Children Act of 1995".
