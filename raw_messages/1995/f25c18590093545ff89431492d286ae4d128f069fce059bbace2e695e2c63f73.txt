And since _I_ started all this trouble with a private e-mail to Futplex;
I'll now jump in saying again, [IANAL]: "This t-shirt may or may not be
illegal to wear in front of non-Americans," from my reading a while back
of the dense text of this silly law, [I'll spare all of you a quote of
it, but there's text that MIGHT be interpreted that way.]

I agree with Tim that actual enforcement of this silly a law is unlikely,
especially in Ian's case right now, and *especially* during our US
(election) "silly season," for obvious reasons.

The availability of strong encryption is unlikely to be a major issue
during this election cycle, despite Cypherpunk efforts, and enforcement
of this dumb law would be a "gift" to those of us who think it should be.
[I hope I'm wrong here, but I think you're safe, Ian.:)]

>Even hyperbull, too.

I wouldn't go *that* far, though. Poorly written, ambiguous, statist<g>
laws can be interpreted in any number of ways and for a variety of
reasons having little (or nothing) to do with justice. <sigh>
