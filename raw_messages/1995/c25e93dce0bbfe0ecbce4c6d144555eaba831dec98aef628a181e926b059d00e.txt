You don't understand it, but once you do you can explain why you're not
using it?  Do you really mean that, or am I misunderstanding?

Many of the GSSAPI principals are in the Boston area:  John Linn at
OpenVision in Cambridge, John Wray at Digital in Littleton, Ted T'so
and Marc Horowitz at MIT, etc.

If you would like to have a discussion, face-to-face or phone, let
me know and I will try to work something out.
