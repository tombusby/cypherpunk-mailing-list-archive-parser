I am in the process of setting up a shop using Mark Twain Bank
Ecash.  Could someone please forward me the scripts to accept Ecash
(running on SunOS.  On c2.org actually) and/or any advice you have
about how to expeditiously implement a shop?  I am about to fax MTB
the agreement form, so I should get information from them "within 24
hours", but that is cutting it awfully close to the Friday deadline
for the US$300.00 fee waiver.


Many thanks!


Bryce
