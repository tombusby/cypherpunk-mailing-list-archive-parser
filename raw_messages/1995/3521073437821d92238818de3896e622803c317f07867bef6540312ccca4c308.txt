On this same track, I suggest that "/dev/random" devices for unix are
an excellent idea. Ted Tso did one for Linux that steals all the bits
of semi-random timing information it can. Such a driver has the
feature that it can be plugged into either a software pseudodriver or
a hardware device if one is available.

There are companies that sell hardware RNGs -- Newbridge, for instance
-- but they charge an arm and a leg for them.

There is also a company that I got literature from that sells RS232
interfaceable radiation detectors, which I have thought about using
for this purpose, but they are also way too expensive.

As you say, what one really needs is something that fits in a small
section of a chip. Unfortunately, this stuff is very delicate analog
-- not the usual thing you find in standard cell -- and very easy to
screw up.

An interesting concept!
