I have the impression that the vast majority of free Unix stuff, even
systems-related, runs well under Linux. Some program have problems with flavors
of Unix. E.g., I remember how much trouble it was to get pcomm to run under
SunOS. I see nothing at all "obnoxious" about this polite request to fix CFS. I
see tons of polite requests to fix free stuff on Usenet.

Perry, one doesn't need to mail someone a Linux machine, or pay for a new
computer. One can install it easily in a partition on a non-dedicated PC
running Windows, and boot it and MS DOS alternatively. I got the latest Linux
CD from $12 from Morse Communications. Or, one can download Linux. Most people
have an Intel box somewhere. Linux is free, and comes with source code.

Everyone I know who writes code serously has at least tried Linux. No everyone
uses it for serious work, but everyone at least played with it. Not having even
tried suggests (to me) a regrettable lack of intellectual curiosity.

After using both Linux and SCO Unix Extensively on Intel boxes, I can attest
that Linux is much less buggy and better supported (via Usenet) than SCO.
