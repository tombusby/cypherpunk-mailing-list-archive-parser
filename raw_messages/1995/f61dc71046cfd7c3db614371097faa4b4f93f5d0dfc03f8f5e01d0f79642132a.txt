I'm not sure how encryption chages the equation if that van on the street 
can read the data off your screen and/or printer.  Just as cryptanalysis is 
a necessary component of good cryptography, some sort of VanEck analysis 
would seem to be required in order to evaluate the utility of methods to 
block it.

What exactly would one need to do to block Van Eck monitoring?  I've seen 
computer rooms that were completely lined with copper sheathing.  Is it 
really necessary to go to that extent?  Will aluminum foil and power line 
conditioning handle it?  You can't really tell how effective 
counter-measures are unless you have some way to see what reduction in 
emitted signal they provide.
