I've heard of telnetting to port 25 to send SEMI-untraceable e-mail.
The procedure, quite frankly, sounds rather complicated.

Most of my mail that I don't want traced goes through the Mixmaster
remailer network.  I'm using Winsock-compatible software via a PPP
connection.  Is it possible, for example, to tell my mailer software
to use the remailer itself, such as "remail.obscura.com" as the mail
host, rather than "mail.myISP.com"?  Will it work, at least for
sending, without having an account at "obscura.com", or whatever
remailer?  Would that be less traceable than sending it through my
ISP's mail host?
