I think it's much more important to the powers that be (and that
eavesdrop) that a key of up to 64 bits includes DES, which means
that lots of system designers will use DES instead of (say) 3DES,
IDEA, or Blowfish.  It's virtually certain that NSA and others have
built keysearch machines for DES.  This gives NSA, et. al., a way
around the key escrow scheme when they want it.  Better yet, NSA
can tell the FBI and BATF and such agencies where to find the
technical papers on how to build one, without releasing any
highly-classified information--those agencies can hire someone to
build them one.  This also keeps NSA from having to dirty its hands
with law-enforcement surveilance.

Of course, it will be interesting to see whether pressure is
applied to keep people from offering "nonstandard" ciphers,
especially things like Blowfish and SEAL, which have key scheduling
algorithms that need a lot of memory and time. It's really only
practical to build keysearch machines for very commonly used
ciphers, and even then, it may be complicated. (For example,
imagine a DES variant whose key schedule required several
exponentiations modulo some 1024-bit prime.)
