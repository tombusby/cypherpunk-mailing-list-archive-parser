Sorry, just my vague memory of a Miami Herald article from a while back.
Perhaps someone else on the list is more familiar with good copy-machines.
Around here, the Columbian cartels are depicted as very, powerful,
with easy payoffs to the highest levels of their country's political
and judicial systems, and access to technology such as Motorola's
encrypted walkie-talkie (supposedly a restricted-sale item). Of course,
US politicians are completely immune to bribes from drug cartels. <g>

See, when the GOVERNMENT spends money, it creates jobs; whereas 
when the money is left in the hands of TAXPAYERS, God only knows 
what they do with it.  Bake it into pies, probably.  Anything to 
avoid creating jobs.  -- Dave Barry
