Friend, 
 
 
A 12 01 95 The Electronic Telegraph newsstory headlined 
 
         Policeman bugs own station by mistake 
 
reports: 
 
   ...a listening device was found at the headquarters of 
   Lothian and Borders Police in Edinburgh. 
 
   The "bug", disguised to look like a plug adaptor, picked up 
   the day-to-day business of the operations room, including 
   radio and telephone messages and conservations between 
   staff. 
 
Conservations between staff?  Conversations in which not a 
word is wasted? 
 
   Its presence was discovered when staff in a rest area tried 
   to tune a radio to a different station and picked up the voices 
   of their colleagues. 
 
I used to despise those who couldn't keep their hands off the 
dial for 5 minutes, but since reading this story my attitude's 
been adjusted. 
 
   Concerned that secrets were being transmitted abroad, the 
   force "swept" the control room with anti-bugging technology, 
   only to find that the device belonged to them. 
 
   It had been "planted" by an officer who thought it was a real 
   adaptor. 
 
 
Of course I believe that! 
 
For what comes around...goes around. 
 
 
Cordially, 
 
Jim
