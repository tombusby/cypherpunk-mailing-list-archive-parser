   Its worth 60 buckx because the book has the old version without the
   weakness in it. they are probably assuming that people will look at the
   book instead of the ftp source code and then get lazy and complie the
   code off the ftp instead of typing or scanning the book.

This is blatently false and an obvious troll.  The book contains a copy
of the source code for MIT PGP 2.6.2, the same version currently being
distributed by MIT.
