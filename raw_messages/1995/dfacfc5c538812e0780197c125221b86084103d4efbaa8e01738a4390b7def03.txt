     That's not all.  This morning I was listening to National Peoples 
     Radio when there was a story about the "Cyber Angels."  It appears 
     that the "Guardian Angels" from NYC are now out on the net trying to 
     catch people talking about child pornography.  
     
     This will be real interesting to watch.  I don't remember all of the 
     story, but the best part I heard was when some "Cyber Angel" was 
     talking about listening a chat session and according to her, GIFs are 
     codewords for pornography.

Yet Another Alarmist TV Show About Child Molesters on the Net:
     
During their coverage of an NFL game on Sunday, the Fox announcers plugged 
an upcoming episode (sometime this week) of _New York Undercover_. They 
used a depressing line like "Think the Net is a safe place to play ?  Think 
again !"  Apparently the show will portray a child molester luring kids via 
the Net, etc., etc. "In a story pulled straight from today's headlines !"
     
Anyway, the mainstream media trashing of the Net continues. Check your local 
listings.
