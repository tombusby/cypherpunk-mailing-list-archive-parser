So, I don't read any of those groups, and I could be dead wrong on all
of this. But I'll yap away anyway.

Off the cuff, I'd say your article could be inappropriate. Granted
it's a good cause, and you're not advertising for yourself but for a
charity. However, charitable spam is still spam (and I'm not calling
your article spam... spam lite, maybe). I understand your point about
feeling a sense of community with the above groups; however, I think
that massive "Please help..." postings can be just as annoying as the
MAKE.MONEY.FAST postings.
