Gee, somebody not been reading the list lately?

I think it's true, the list has become the fast lane to dump junk into.

Re the idea of making cpunks subscriber only- that would solve a few
problems, and people could post anonymously if a seperate address were
rigged up ("security through obscurity") as a subscribed address that
throws away anything from cpunks and forwards everything else to cpunks.
The idea being, of course, that if you're not close enough to the action
to know what the current anon-routing address is, you should go away.

At least the bulk of the conspiracypunk stuff has gone away.
