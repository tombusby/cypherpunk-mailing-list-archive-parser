There's already some extra slack in the law and the official policy
for exporting encryption for use in banking; the NSA could get around it
by asking the banking regulators to impose some sort of Key Forfeiture nonsense,
which wouldn't lose much privacy since most banks are already
pretty cooperative about such things.

On the other hand, banks are rich enough to hire some off-shore programmer 
to write triple-DES implementations, given the current protocols,
as well as to lobby CONgress or the administration to keep the NSA in line.
