Why forge it? Why not simply buy a netsite server with a valid certificate.
Let's say you paid full list for it $5000. It is the classic MITM attack
but the protection against that attack was generally that the parties
communicating "knew" each other. 

This is a fundamental weakness of putting the security at the SSL level as
opposed to a possibly higher level. With the netscape attack since your
client never cares "how" (or to whom) the SSL connection is made, it never
shows you the information about where the source key came from. Only that
it is valid.
