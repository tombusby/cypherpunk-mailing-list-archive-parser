-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I liked using the mkpgp program for signing email, but found that, quite 
frankly, it had too many features for me to use, when really all I wanted 
was a program that would sign my messages easily.  This accomplishes just 
that.  If you want to encrypt messages, either use mkpgp or encrypt your 
messages outside of pine.

Instructions are provided as comments within the script.

Let me know if you have any problem.

# PINESIGN v1.0
# Written by:  Robert A. Hayden <hayden@krypton.mankato.msus.edu>

# PINESIGN is a simple program that will allow you to automatically sign 
# your email and news messages composed with the Pine 3.89 mail reader.  It 
# may also work with other mail and news programs, but it has not been 
# tested.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING PINE
# 
# You need to define the following options in Pine.  This can be done 
# either via the SETUP options in the main menu of Pine, or via editing 
# the .pinerc. 
#
# 	A)	signature-file=" "  (an empty space)
#	B)	enable-alternate-editor-cmd
#	C)	enable-alternate-editor-implicitly (optional but recommended)
#	D) 	signature-at-bottom
#	E)	editor=<exact path to this script>

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING PINESIGN
#
# The PGP program must be in your path, and the PGPPATH environment 
# variable must be defined.  See the PGP documentation for details.
#
# Double check that the first line of this program points to sh. 
#
# Edit the SIGPATH and PINEEDITOR variables to point at your signature 
# (if any) and the editor you wish to use for your Pine mail.  Default 
# signature will be the file .signature in your $HOME directory.  
# Default editor is pico -z -t.

SIGPATH=$HOME/.signature
PINEEDITOR='pico -z -t'

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING PINESIGN
#
# When you compose a message, you will compose your message as normal.  
# When you exit your editor (control-X in Pico), you will receive a prompt 
# asking if you wish to sign the message.  If you respond with y, Y or just 
# press return, you will be prompted for your PGP passphrase and then 
# dumped back to the address/subject section of Pine.  If you type 
# anything else, your message will not be signed.  Your .signature file 
# will be appended AFTER your digital signature. 
#
# If you have not defined your alternate editor to be run implicitly, you 
# will need to start it manually.  If you do not run the alternate editor,
# your .signature file will not be appended and you will also have to do
# that manually.  It is highly recommended that your define your alternate
# editor to run implicitly. 

###  DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE  ###
