If I were going to create a hole in PGP, I would create a "bug" in
PGP's key generation process which would limit the primes PGP
chooses to a relatively small subset. Then when I wanted to break,
I would factor by searching this small subset.

I could also try to put a bug in the code that chooses a Random
Idea key, making it choose from a small subset, that again could be
searched.

To put a bug in the idea portion of PGP would be difficult because
people can check if PGP can intemperate with other implementations
of IDEA.
