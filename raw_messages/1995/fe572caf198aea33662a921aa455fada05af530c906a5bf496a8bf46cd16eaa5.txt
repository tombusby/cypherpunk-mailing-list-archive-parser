We use DDS in some of our Microwave equipment between sites.

I agree; but, if the information you are passing is truly that important
just use a landline phone.  Eliminate the possable "leak".
I'm not claiming that a landline phone is secure, but your cordless is
connected to it, so no matter how good your security is on the phone its no
longer secure once it leaves the base station and enters the landline.

Further encryption can be implemented but this requires equipment on both
ends.  Really aren't we trying to create the most secure methods of
information exchange with the least amount of cost?  I'm budget restricted
so PGP and the internet are more secure and cheaper for me than most other
means of comunication, so far. :)
