Right.

It need not be the same information - i.e. if the encryption process adds 
enough noise to the message, the extraction process might by lossy, without 
any total loss for the receiver. This may be possible particularly if 
Fourier-style transforms are used, as the "selection key" could pick up 
less "frequencies" of a message than are stored at the intermediary.

The same could be said of a private/public key pair. What is crucial is the
association between the keys.

This said, while I can imagine separate systems for the intermediary loosing 
correlation between incoming and outgoing messages (eg - it's _really_ tough,
without fancy pattern recognition, to associate a JPEG with the original), 
and for generating three associated keys (secret splitting? something to do
with Brands' blind signatures?), I really can't imagine a way of putting it
all together. Someone will have to be inspired, as Diffie was...
