I was not under the impression that Chaum e-cash was free from the need to
keep a list of spent cash. Do you meant that it would be the bank, not the
remailer, that would keep the database?

Messages are not identifiable as "part n of m" except at the last hop. If
you are a remailer, then they are only visible as such to you. In transit
they appear as any other message. Yes, there is a polite way to send to a
remailer's bit bucket with some remailers. Ghio remailers will trash any
message sent which requests remailing to "null". Remailer@nately is a Ghio
remailer. I can't remember if I implemented that in Mixmaster. If not, I
will.
