Just to clarify: one of the most important parts of the design is the 
negotation mechanism, so a lot of effort has gone into these mechanisms. 
The aim is to _not_ have to do lots of RTT negotations through the use of 
caching and dynamic profiling. The negotation facilities in HTTP 1.0 are not 
used, not because there isn't a need for them, but because they don't 
offer sufficient power, and are much too inefficient. 

Oh, and when I say dynamic profiling, I'm referring to semi-standard 
profiles that can be obtained over the network, not to OSI style 
dead-trees. Deriving negotiated feature sets from a profile works really 
well for applications like the WEB, as a vast amount of this information 
remains the same for all copies of a particular version of a Browser. For 
example, all copies of hotjava support html 1.0, some netscape 
extensions, and can handle inline gifs, but not inline jpegs; alpha 
hotjava supports the alpha applet API.
