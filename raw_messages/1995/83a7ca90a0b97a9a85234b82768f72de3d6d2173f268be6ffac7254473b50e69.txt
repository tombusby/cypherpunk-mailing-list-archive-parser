The demo of the Interceptor I saw seemed to show it jumping from 150 MHz to 450 
MHz without any external adjustments, it locked on the strongest signal.
Granted, it can only receive one frequency at a time, but there shouldn't be any
significant delays when the phone hops a frequency.  The Interceptor's 
frequency readout is a bargraph style LED.  The Scout, from what I can
see in Optoelectronics' ad doesn't have any frequency controls on it, it does
have a digital frequency readout.  As far as timing is concerned, the Scout 
might be less useful because I think it feeds the frequency into the scanner for
reception.  Most scanners take a significant amount of time to change
frequencies.
