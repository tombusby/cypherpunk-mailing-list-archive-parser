Some comments (and note that I've just cleaned my white board, so I
may not be thinking too rationally):

Hmm...  I don't think I completely agree with this; on the contrary,
the "senior members" of the list seem generally quite open and
understanding of the issues re cryptography for the general public.

I actually consider this a feature.  With a "straight" name for the
organization, like "International Cryptographic Interest Society" or
something, we run the risk of being co-opted into the "mainstream"
without even realizing it.

There's nothing wrong with being a punk, remember.  That the word is
weighted simply means that people have to overcome prejudice.  Indeed,
much of the motivations for boosting cryptography is to protec the
rights of every individual to be opt out of conformity.  If everyone
were normal & mainstream, who'd care about hiding anything?  What's to
protect?

Whoooa there; can you really say that?  Can you really say that as
society absorbs marginalized fragments of the culture that there's not
a significant adjustment?

In 1955, if I walked down the street with tussled hair, a white
t-shirt covered by a ratty leather jacket, and messy jeans, I'd be an
"obvious" criminal delinquent; now, I'd be in a Calvin Klein add.
There's certainly a profound effect on culture wrought by the mere
existance of fringe groups, particularly if the groups can gain access
to media.

I think again that this is a generalization over the membership.  Some
do feel that way, and some don't; I think what you said above about
the uniting factor of wanting to see cryptography popularized is
accurate, and that's the theme that binds us together (if anything
does).

I wonder about that assertion.

That idea seems pretty much a fundamental one to be attacked in any
effort to popularize cryptography.

Again, I think that making a strong statement every time the name of
the organization has to be read aloud by a newscaster is a feature.

Is "cypherpunk" invertible?

...  Sorry, I have to quit now; I need to borrow a fan before the
fumes knock me out.

In summary, I think your concerns are valid, but I'd hesitate to do
something radical like change the list name.  After all, think of all
the mail filter files that'd have to be fixed :-)
