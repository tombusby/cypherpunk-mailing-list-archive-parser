Our intuitive notion of reputation combines the issues of reliability and
quality.  In your example, whether you choose the reliable vendor or the
unreliable one depends on whether you are risk-seeking or risk-averse. 
You must prefer one or the other or be indifferent.  In general how you
make these choices depend on your values and your expectations of what the
vendors will do, which include both expectations of reliability and 
expectations of quality.

Can you elaborate more on why the analysis is inadequate?  (I know it 
probably isn't adequate, but why do you think so?)

Right, I'm speaking from the point of view of the analyst when I say
"good", but it also applies to individual participants.  Each person does
what he thinks is in his best interest, but if this turns out to be
unstable for the reputation system as a whole, then it won't last very
long so there is little point in getting involved in the first place.  In
other word, I would not choose to participate in an unstable reputation
system.

You are right that there is continuum of strategies, but I assume there is
a discontinuity between completely throwing away your reputation and any
other strategy.  So operating value is the maximum amount of profit you
can make by optimizing among all other strategies except disappearing.

When I wrote the original post I was thinking of the classic anonymous 
marketplace.  But I think it can apply to other types of markets.  
Cheating costs can be easily factored into the throw-away value, and 
an important question for any theory of reputation to answer is how 
to structure transactions to minimize this value.  Many more assumptions 
need to be made in modeling a particular reputation system, but I was 
trying to list some general properties that might apply to all reputation 
systems.

The tit-for-tat program that won both contests uses an extremely simple 
reputation algorithm -- it expects the next action of the other player 
to be the same as the last action.  This is an example of what I called a 
"good" reputation algorithm.  It serves the self-interest of the entities
that use it; it is cheap to use; when widely used the system is stable.
