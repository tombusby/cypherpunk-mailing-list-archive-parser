Not in cracking "truly large" problems by brute force. Even if each of the
million processors is capable of 100 MIPS (which is unlikely, given the PIM
approach and the fine-granularity, few-bit-or-less word size, etc.), this
is only 10^8 MIPS. For problems that (for instance) 10^75 machines would
have to spend 10^10 years on, not even a drop in an ocean.

The point is that no existing machines are going to make a dent in these
calculations, though algorithmic cleverness _might_ make factoring much
easier (personally, I doubt it).

I wrote my response before seeing the other response someone else (Thaddeus
J. Beier) gave the name of the company. Thad's details match what I recall
about this Bowie company. The archives should have articles on this, dating
back about a year or so ago. As I recall, someone on the list knew people
working at the Supercomputer Research outfit.

You, whoever you are, asked about the operational status of Cray Computer,
and I answered. It entered Chapter Seven liquidation, parts of existing
computers were sold for scrap or museum/curio objects, the GaAs fab was
sold to another company, and the employees scattered. Claiming the NSA
moved it "in-house" is implausible, at least in terms of these events.

I asked what evidence you have for this claim. Idle speculation, based on
innumerate estimates of plausibility are helpful to no one.

On our list, and in the circles I am familiar with, "speculations" are not
treated with more respect than are actual "claims" (whatever they are). If
you speculate that "really, really fast computers" will make today's
ciphers insecure, based on not even the simplest of calculations, expect to
be either ignored or called to task. This is the way science works, by
falsification of theories (and speculations).

A 2048-bit key, such as many of us use, uses a roughly 700-decimal-digit
modulus. "Schneier," mentioned in my paragraph, is "Applied Cryptography."
Page 284 of the 1st Ed. has a discussion of the work involved in factoring
large moduli. Rivest has made some more detailed estimates.

Given your rudeness and self-professed ignorance of even the basic math, I
see no point in wasting any more of my time on your posts.
