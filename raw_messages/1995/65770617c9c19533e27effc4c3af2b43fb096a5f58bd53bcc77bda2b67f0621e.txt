Due to a misunderstanding on my part, I grabbed too much key space.
Here's one contiguous block that needs to be worked on:

9 1a80000000 31
10 1b00000000 31
11 1b80000000 31
12 1c00000000 31
13 1c80000000 31
14 1d00000000 31
15 1d80000000 31
16 1e00000000 31
17 1e80000000 31
18 1f00000000 31
19 1f80000000 31
20 2000000000 31
