If your attacker has a more sophisticated statistical model of noise
distributions than you do, then he can deduce the existence of message.

Well, there's things like the subliminal channel in DSS (discussed in Applied
Cryptography) whereby a DSS chip could leak bits of a user's private key.  In
the channel discussed, even if the user suspected the existence of the
channel, there's no way he can prove it.  Now, that's steganography!
