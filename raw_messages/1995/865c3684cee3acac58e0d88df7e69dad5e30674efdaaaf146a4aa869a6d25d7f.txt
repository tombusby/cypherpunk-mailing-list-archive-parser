Zimmermann and which partner?

If it was Charlie Merritt, then all I can say is that I'm surprised. Kelly
Goen...now there's a possibility.

P.S. As the thread title--"Re: Phil Zimmermann/Amnesty
International?"--suggests, Phil Z. is the subject being discussed. Gary
Jeffers made the bizarre speculation that Amnesty International might want
to consider Phil a "prisoner of conscience" or a "political prisoner," or
somesuch. All Michael Froomkin and others of us were pointing out is that
this would be rather difficult, given that Phil has not even been charged,
let alone tried, let alone imprisoned.

How Mark Furhman migrated into this thread is beyond me. But, then, he
killed Ron and Nicole, planted the glove to frame the nigger he hated so
much, and was also involved in the bombing of the WTC. That he helped Phil
export PGP is thus not surprising.
