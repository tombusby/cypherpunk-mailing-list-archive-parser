Actually quite a few hackers/phreaks have been encrypting phone 
conversations for a while.  Not by any complex mathematics but 
simple modifications to the phone frequencies...Don't have any 
sites handy but for those interested I'll look up some of my old
material.  I'll also check a large compendium of boxes to see if
Purple has been designated.  Anyone interested in box plans of 
different colors e-mail me.
