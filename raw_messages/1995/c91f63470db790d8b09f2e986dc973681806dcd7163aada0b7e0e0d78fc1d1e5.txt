Yeah, this was discussed; mix it in with a cool screen saver 
        "We're busy hacking Microsoft!" bouncing around the screen
and you could probably get a lot of people to try it, assuming of course
that it can run in offline mode conveniently, which I'm not sure
Netscape can yet (downloading the software, copying mozock/nullsock as
winsock, and restarting Netscape doesn't strike me as convenient,
which means it's also not an off-line mail/news reader yet.)

The negative part is that Java Bytecode interpretation is about 10x slower
than native code; you'd have to get people to download native libraries
for their platform to do the grunt work.
