Indeed.

And let me clearly state that I am not proposing an either-or situation. In
a real ecology of competing digital cash schemes, unconstrained by the
software patent issue we now are facing, there would likely be "online
clearing only" systems, "offline clearing only" systems, and various
hybrids and variants. The market would then decide, based on transaction
costs, convenience, security, anonymity features, etc. As with the "real"
economy, where a variety of financial instruments coexist.
