Good point.  But if you turn word wrap off, your message will go out as one long line, or one long line for each paragraph.  Most smart mail programs will handle this cleanly, but I assume there are still many that won't.  Have all the people who are using PGP with Eudora been sending mail without line breaks?  Is this not a problem for 99.99% of the mail-reading software out there?

With Word Wrap on, it seems to add CRs (or CR/LFs on a PC) to the end of each line upon sending.  This obviously causes a message not to match the signature, since all of those CRs weren't there when you composed it.  With Word Wrap off, your text still wraps on the screen when you're composing, but those unwanted CRs in the sent mail don't get added.
