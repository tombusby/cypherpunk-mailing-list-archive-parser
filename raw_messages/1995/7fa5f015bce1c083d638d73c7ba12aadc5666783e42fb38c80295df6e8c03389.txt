I'm thankful that someone can occassionally (or even always) point out that the messages are getting rather far from what is considered the main topics of the list. This is a very high volume mailing list, at least three times as high as anything else I try to read. I didn't subscribe to a conspiracy buff list but it is not my intention to go out of my way to insult anyone here. But there are lists (aren't there?) for people who find such speculation interesting.
