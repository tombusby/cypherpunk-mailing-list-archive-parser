Neither pop 2 nor pop 3 tell you whether you've read a message or not.
pop 2 does bump up the current number with an ACKS, but if you move around
with READ n, then that's useless.  pop 3 doesn't do that.

I just reread the rfcs to make sure that I wasn't missing anything,
(RFC 1725: Post Office Protocol - Version 3, RFC 937: Post Office Protocol -
Version 2).  Am I missing something?
