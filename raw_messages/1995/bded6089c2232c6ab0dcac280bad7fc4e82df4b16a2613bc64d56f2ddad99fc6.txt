Well if we gonna go that way just use HotJava and create your own 
protocol and content handlers. They are d/l dynamicly. Just as an example.
Write a pop3 protoclos handlers, they use the URL 
pop3://mail.host.com/loginname to get your mail. Oh whats that? Someone
sent you a application/pgp message well guess they pgp content handler will
have to take care of that.

Its really a shame that Sun hasent released HotJava with the JDK it could
give netscape a sun for its money.
