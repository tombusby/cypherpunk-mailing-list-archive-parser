There's a Hakim Bey web site with the full text of TAZ and a bunch of
other things, including the pamphlet "Radio Sermonettes" and various
other essays.  I've got the URL at home, so I can post it to the list
tonight (sorry, but it's easier than asking people to email me for it
individually).  The text, at that site at least, is the absolutely
authorized original (from our original files).  I've got other odds
and ends by H.B. that have never been made available on the net which
I may or may not get around to posting in the next few weeks.

The followup to TAZ (the book), which will probably be called "The
No-Go Zone," will be out in about six months.  Well, maybe nine...
