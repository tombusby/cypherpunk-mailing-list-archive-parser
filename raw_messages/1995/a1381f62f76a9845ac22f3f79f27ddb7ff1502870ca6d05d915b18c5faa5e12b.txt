	You seem to have missed the point. A "virus" is not there to fix
your copy because you want it. Its there because I  want it. I would
be released so that infects all possible machines. It would either
remove the rutines in netsape that allow escrow or simple remove the 
offensive copy of netscape ( cant use it if its not there 8)
Violation of the license? really? Like virus writers give a damm.

	Yes and you must remember the power of the net. As an example remember
the heat Microsoft took for the Registration Wizard what all it does is 
ASK YOU if you would like to submit the recorded information about your 
computer to Microsoft. It was so blow out of proportion that it even made 
it to places that would check this kinda of stuff like Information Week.
