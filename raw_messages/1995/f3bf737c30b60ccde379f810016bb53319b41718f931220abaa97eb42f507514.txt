OK - I'll rephrase my query/quandary. If I create a message by feeding in
plain text and asking for an Encrypt and Sign is the FORMAT of the
resulting file different from one there I Sign the Text and then (in a
separate step/pass) Encrypt the Signed Message (IOW is E+S just a short cut
for the two processes done in sequence using the same key for both
operations)? If E+S is only a short-cut then doing the steps separately
will give the result that PGP3 will get automatically with its Separate
Function Keys Feature.

This will all become (more) academic once PGP3 comes out and Sign-Only keys
would not be usable for Encryption.
