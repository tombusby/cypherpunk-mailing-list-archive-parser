I'm not trying to start a flame war, just telling
people what's REALLY happening.

ATT and Netscape are both tools of the CIA/NSA.
Blaze and Weinstein are in on the
plot to force GAK upon us.  Neither one
says enough about the evils of GAK on their
web page, so they're obviously for GAK and
only pretending to be against it to fool
the cypherpunks and curry favor with their NSA
masters.

Evidently the cypherpunks are all too impressed
with Blaze and Weinstein's master degrees to see
what's really happening.  Only true visionaries
like myself and Dr. Frederic B Cohen are telling
it like it is; everyone else has had the wool
pulled over their eyes by the NSA/ATT/Netscape axis.

It's amazing how clear everything becomes once
one stops taking the medication that THEY prescribed.
