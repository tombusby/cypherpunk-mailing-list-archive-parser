I disagree with the cost assumptions that it costs $10K. These
are "relatively" imaginary costs. If you already have the machines 
(like a lot of universities and corporations) then the marginal
cost of breaking the key is practically nil. The person doing the
cracking certainly doesn't incur any costs. So what if it takes
2 weeks. An evil student/hacker/whatever would be willing to wait two
weeks for a credit card with a $5-$oo limit if he could just use
the machines at night when people might not notice. 
Just my $.02
