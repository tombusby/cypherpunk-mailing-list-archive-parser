This is a VERY positive idea!

This is something that could get two things done:

1. Protect ISPs and Web sites from claims they aren't taking any steps to
block children. (I won't get into the "children should be allowed to
appreciate the beauty of the human body" issue, just noting that an ISP or
Web site could deny access to account holders under 18, or over 30, or
whatever he wants to do.)

2. Get wider currency for the concept of digitally signed credentials,
especially if these are _blinded credentials_, where the credential is for
an age, say, and not an identity. (Standard Chaumian stuff, though likely
to be nontrivial to implement.)

There may be ways around the loss of anonymity. Ideally, with blinded
credentials, But in the short term, through Web proxies and/or servers.

For example, Sameer's c2.org could issue accounts to people who can prove
they are over 18 (notarized copies of birth certif., passport, etc.).
Sameer's system would then have a credential saying "this account name is
over 18."

(There is of course little that can be done about people who lend their
accounts to minors, absent any effective biometric security measures. No
current system, certainly not Exon-Coates, can deal with this.)

I think this could be quite a good project, provided it is not trying to be
all things to all people.
