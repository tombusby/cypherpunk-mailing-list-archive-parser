hahah....netcom can make up anything they want to.

You do of course, read these agreements before you get on...don't you...

Here's a simple solution...don't get on a systems who's AUP you disagree 
with.

You assertion that simply because a company is not netcom's size, that 
its unprofessional and incompetent is rediculous.

right....because Netcom is FILLED with assholes....those that crosspost 
to 10 groups are overlooked

so...AOL is better than netcom?

at least they have an irc server.

and ALL of netcom's problems are related to the systems and network....

they didn't plan their expansion correctly....and as a result...are 
feeling it now.

and Netcom has many of the undesirable characteristics found in big 
systems like Prodigy and Compuserve...

if you honestly find this attractive.....well, enjoy

well of course.....Netcom will read your mail too if you are accused of 
hacking.  The fact is....the chances of someone reading your mail on 
Netcom are about 100 times higher than on a smaller system....simply 
becuase the place is so overridden with root wielding hackers who have 
nothing better to do than torment others....

well......once again.....shop before you buy.  You can't make such 
blanket assertations, because they simply aren't true.

Netcom is also the LEADING source of trouble for the rest of the network 
because of the way they handle their user population.  They can't keep up 
with all their problems.  This seems to translate to you as - "They 
respect me and don't bother me"  THe fact is....they don't even know who 
the hell you are.  And....being a matter of scale, as several pointed out...

netcom is about 100 times the size of winternet....(approximation)...

thus...lets multiply everything by 100, profits, users, problems, etc, etc

If one of their user's posted (10x100) 1000 MAKE.MONEY.FAST posts to 1000 
different groups.....you can bet that person wouldn't have their account 
the next day.

this is THEIR network.....

there is ANOTHER network out there....its called...the Internet.

I've had MANY users at my site connecting from netcom, and insisting that 
our T1 is overloaded because of the chunky responses they are getting...

well, guess what.  As soon as they tried from somewhere else....their 
problems dissapeared.

They contribute very little to the Internet .... and that which they do 
is overshadowed by the harm many of their more immature users cause

its not?  then your opinion doesn't count...right?
i mean...you're just a satisfied user

If you call netcom usable...you've obviously NEVER tried another ISP...or 
had several VERY bad experiences with the few you've tried.  I urge you 
to give the whole situation another look.
