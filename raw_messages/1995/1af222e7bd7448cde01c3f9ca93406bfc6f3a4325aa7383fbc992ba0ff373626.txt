   This point may have been raised before, but anyway, unless you're using a 
   swiss-bank issued credit card for a numbered account (if that's at all 
   possible), or a bogus name on the card, why would anybody want to use 
   something as completely traceable as a credit card to pay for a remailer 
   or a data haven?

Because the message you sent into the remailer isn't tracable to the
message that left the remailer (isn't that the point?).  Give the FBI
credit for *some* brains and assume that they already know you used
the remailer, because they saw mail from you enter the remailer.
