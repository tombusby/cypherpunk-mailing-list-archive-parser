>GOVERNMENT'S SECRETS FLOW THROUGH AN INTERNET CLONE
>
>WASHINGTON - When the US intelligence community recently decided to
>modernize the way it communicates, it did what countless other 
>government agencies, businesses and individuals have done over the
>last few years:  it turned to the Internet.
>
>But the regular Internet wouldn't do.  For spies and other government
>officials concerned about secrecy, that very public, very uncontrollable
>global mesh of computer networks was too risky a place to do business.
>
>So the intelligence community created its own Internet.
>
>Dubbed Intelink and based on the same technology used to run and
>navigate the original Internet, this new network for sharing supersecret
>information---including satellite imagery and video footage---officially
>began operating just a few weeks ago.
>
>When the bugs are worked out and a final system is in place, it will 
>allow analysts, policy-makers, military officials and soldiers in the
>field to tap quickly and directly into classified information at the
>Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Pentagon
>and diverse other parts of the national security bureaucracy.
