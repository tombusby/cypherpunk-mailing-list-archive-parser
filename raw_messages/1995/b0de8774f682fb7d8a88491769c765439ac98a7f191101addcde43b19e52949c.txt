Sorry if my choice of words offended you.. the intent was to express the 
feeling of being violated without consent. Perhaps I should have used the 
term violated or some other less violent term.

The point being, I did not give permission for my records to be 
distributed, nor did I see a disclaimer on my credit cards that states 
that the transactions I make will be sold off to mailing houses in order 
to target me for additional sales.
