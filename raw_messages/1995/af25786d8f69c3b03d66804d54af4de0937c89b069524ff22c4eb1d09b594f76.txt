David Friedman is now teaching law at Santa Clara University, over in
Silicon Valley. We've been in contact, and expect to meet for dinner
sometime soon. (He attended a special Cypherpunks meeting a few years ago.)

His "Machinery of Freedom" and many other articles clearly establishes him

Vernor Vinge believes the same thing.
