But how do you know that you want to send to Egghead Software in the
first place? EHS could be a MIMT, maybe you really want to talk to
Eggfoot Software, but every e-mail Eggfoot sends out is intercepted
and changed to read "Egghead" (and vice versa)...

By the time you verify that Egghead is who you want, you could have just
as easily verified that the key is who you want. Thus skipping one step
and avoiding all the attacks applicable to that step.
