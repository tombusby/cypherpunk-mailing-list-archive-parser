The more timing noise between the attacker and the target, the
harder it is to exploit the measurements.  Based on some (very
rough) experiments I've set up here, I suspect the attack is easy
if you're on the same computer (and measure CPU load), probably
feasible if you're on the same network and the host and net are
unloaded, and unlikely otherwise.  The attack is especially
interesting against crypto tokens that are supposed to hold a secret
key secret, where you can get very close and take very good timing
measurements.

Keep in mind also that Kocher's results are only the first cut,
based on a very simple statistical model.  I suspect we'll be seeing
many improvements and variations over the coming months.

Bottom line is that implementing good cryptosystems is a lot harder
than one might think...
