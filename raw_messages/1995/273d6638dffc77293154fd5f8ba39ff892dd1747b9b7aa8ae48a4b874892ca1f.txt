Hi,

We're preparing to send a press release to all the UK newspapers and 
magazine that we can afford, on the subject of hackers.  So far there 
haven't been many attacks by the media on this often misrepresented 
group, and we hope to start building a good relationship between 
hackers and the media while it is still possible.

We plan to send them a comprehensive letter offering an alternative to 
the hacker stereotype, and maybe a floppy disk containing a few usenet 
faq files on the subject.

If you have any ideas, suggestions or contributions to this effort, I'd 
very much like to hear from you.

I'd also like to hear from you if you are a journalist yourself, and 
would like a copy of our release once it is done, or further 
information about our cause.

Or if you'd just like a chat about this subject (wherever you are), 
feel free to mail me.

Thanks,


Alex
