You're talking about stripping them out *with PostScript code*, which
is obviously a dangerous proposition (but is still possible if you do
it right, and if systemdict is not read-only as it often is.)

If you strip them out by taking the source to the interpreter and
stripping them out there, then the PostScript code can be as malicious
as it likes; if the interpreter has no access to disk file primitives,
it can't read or write files, period.

If you don't have source to your interpreter, or it your interpreter
is deeply intertwingled with your OS or window system, obviously this
will be harder to do.  So in that case, you can run a different, 
smaller interpreter that you can isolate.  It's not like they aren't
widely available.

Of course, if the hypothetical cracker is going to take advantage of
buffer-overflow bugs in the interpreter to do what they want, then it
doesn't *matter* that it's a PostScript interpreter; at that point, 
it's just another buggy program.

I think it would be a really good trick to implement disk I/O in
PostScript that will work in an interpreter which didn't provide any
disk I/O routines in systemdict.

Of course it works -- if you know what extensions the interpreter you're
running provides and if you've likewise turned off the dangerous ones.

How?

As has been pointed out to you, repeatedly, we do not ship a PostScript
interpreter, and Netscape does not come configured to *look* for a
PostScript interpreter of any kind.  When you run it off-the-shelf, and
hand it a PostScript file, it says "I've never heard of this.  What do
you want to do with it?"

Just like it would with a perl script.  Or an awk script.  Or an sh
script.  Or a Microsoft Word document.  Or any other program capable
of file I/O or network connections.

The user picks the interpreter they want to hand the document to.
If anyone ignores this advice you keep repeating, it's the user.
Not us.

Stop, I'm getting chills.

I'm sure we all love you too.
