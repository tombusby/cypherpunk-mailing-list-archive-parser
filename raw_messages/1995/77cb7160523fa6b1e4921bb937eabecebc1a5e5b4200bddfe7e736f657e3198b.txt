I thought they were markedly different!

I always understood there were NO restrictions on crypto export,
import or use to western countries.  There used to be COCOM agreements
which said that you should get approval to send commercially produced
crypto to some blacklisted countries (Iraq, etc).  I also read that
the COCOM restrictions did not claim to apply to free software.

Anyway, I read that the COCOM agreement has expired, so none of this
applies anymore, even.

There are a number of surveys around, and the above is my
understanding from reading those.

If you have any thing else I should be reading I'd like to see it.

Indeed.

I think he would be safe emailing it, putting it on the WWW, or
posting it to USENET.  There are no selective access restrictions on
*any* crypto ftp/http sites that I know of in the UK (like various
ones in the US which make a sho of enforcing the export restriction by
not allowing export to non-US domain names.)
