Uh-oh!  I'd better shut down my remailer, but fast, based on an
unsubstantiated rumor.  Especially one that makes little sense.  Why
do you need a sting?  All you have to do is use a single remailer, and
send the mail from yourself, to yourself.  You know the source,
destination, and who handled it.  IF a court can be convinced that
forwarding email containing illegal materials is the same as asking to
receive email containing illegal materials, then ALL of our butts are
toast.

You fool.  If you use remailers regularly, then YOU ARE KNOWN TO THE
SPOOKS.  Face facts.  We know that the FBI spends a minimum of
$10,000,000 each year (count the wiretaps, multiply by agents and do
the math) just for telephone wiretaps.  Computer wiretaps are a LOT
CHEAPER.
