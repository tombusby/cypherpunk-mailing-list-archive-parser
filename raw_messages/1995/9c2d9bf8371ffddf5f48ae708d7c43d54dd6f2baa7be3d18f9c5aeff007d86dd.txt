This is something John Gilmore called for when he wrote:

There were several other posts in this thread, so interested folks might
want to check the archives for this time period.

Continuing on with Peter Monta's post:

I agree, for several reasons. First, I agree that electronic noise sources
are easy to build, easy to get licenses for use (basically, no licenses,
unless the ITAR boys decide random number generators are munitions--maybe
the "This t-shirt is a munition" could have "export-controlled dice"?

Second, the ease of integration as a standard library module.

However, getting the chip companies to do this will not be easy. They
generally don't see the need (hey, even _we_ don't, given the diverse
opinions on what is needed).

This is why many of us favor an external dongle that plugs in somewhere.
Then it could be sold cheaply and not have to get "buy-ins" from industry
and committees.

One idea is something that superficially looks like a modem, as everyone
has modem software and ports (though I suppose many people use internal
modems and so can't easily access it.) One would attach the "RNG-modem," a
little dongle, and grab noise into a buffer for processing (hashing,
filtering, etc.), or as ASCII garbage.

(Before anyone jokingly asks about "1-800-RANDOMS," I've thought of it. Not
practical, for obvious reasons.)

A purer approach would be just a noise source dumped into dev/random, or
whatever one wishes to call it.
