Since the support that Thunder 7 provides (with Wordprocessing and
Wordprocessing-Like Programs that it supports) is indistinguishable from
that provided by each program's integrated SpellChecker (along with T7
providing a common set of "extra" User-Extendable Dictionaries as well as a
Glossary/Mis-Spelling/Words-to-Replace Dictionary [ie: Pre-Prime the list
of incorrectly spelled words for "Replace All" so the user's personal
misspellings are automatically corrected without any interaction on his/her
part]), I think the ball is initially in the court of those who claim it is
not a universal module (admittedly only for those WPs it supports) to
explain why is does not function as one would function if it existed.

IMHO - T7 is walking and quacking like a Duck so I think calling it a
"Duck" (as a first approximation) is not an unjustified action <g>.
