If you are interested, the first (alpha) version of my anonymous httpd
proxy is available  see htpp://hplyot.obspm.fr:6661/ (where it runs,
unless it dies meanwhile, then see
htpp://hplyot.obspm.fr/~dl/wwwtools.html  oor mail me)

Ok, what does it do more than cern's :

  + It's single process, light, and mostly multi-tasking
  + It removes all nasty 'personal' infos like user-agent, referer,...
  + If there is an "ProxyControl: V1 <proxy-list>" in the header,
    it will send the request to first the the first proxy listed
    in the list and sending to that one a "ProxyControl: V1
    <rest-of-proxy-list>" header
  + If you launch your personnal copy of the AnonProxyHttp with
    arguments  "port 2 ph1:pp1 ph2:pp2 ph3:pp3" and 
    setenv http_proxy http://localhost:port/
    accessing the web now goes through your AnonProxy, which randomly
    creates a route to your url going through 2 of the 3 specified
    other AnonProxy

What will come when i'll have some time :
  
  + more flexibility in the spec of the other AnonProxies and
    a centralized and/or distributed catalog of availble proxies

What I need folks for :

  + get it and run it (and debug?), so we could chain them :-)

What is the big catch/problem :

  + its written in .... Tcl + tcl-dp + tclX !
    (plz don't flame me...)
    so you need a tcl-dp+tclX interp to try it locally...

Feedback  / Comments / ... welcome
