COMMUNITY CONNEXION TO OFFER REWARD FOR HACKING MICROSOFT

Sept. 29 1995 - Community ConneXion, an Internet Privacy Provider in
Berkeley, CA, announced today that it will be providing awards to
people who find and publicize security holes in Microsoft
products.

"Microsoft claims to be promoting secure transactions on the net,"
said Sameer Parekh, founder of Community ConneXion, "We will prove
them wrong." Microsoft has been quoted making disparaging comments
about their competitor Netscape's product, Netscape Navigator.

Community ConneXion has also been offering a reward to expose holes in
Netscape's products. "We target widely used programs," said Parekh.
Parekh expects that many bugs and flaws in Microsoft's security
software will be found.

People want to use the Internet to do business. They want to be able
to buy things, manage their finances, and communicate privately from
the comfort of their home computer. Without a secure infrastructure
none of this is possible.

Information about the Hack Microsoft promotion is available from
http://www.c2.org/hackmsoft/.  People who have found security holes
and have written exploits are directed to send mail to
hackmsoft@c2.org.

Community ConneXion is the premier provider of privacy on the
Internet. They provide anonymous email accounts and support the
anonymous remailer infrastructure. Information is available from
http://www.c2.org/ or info@c2.org.

Navigator are trademarks of Netscape Communications Corp. This
promotion is not affiliated with Microsoft or Netscape.
