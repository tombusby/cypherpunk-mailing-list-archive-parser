I have no love for most banks, and have experienced your senario on at
least two seperate times...  In fact, I tried to deposit a cashiers
check from another bank to open a CD in one bank, and they had to "hold"
the check for one week.  I can imagine holding it so I don't start
forging checks on a forged cashiers check, but on a 30 day CD?  Ugh.

My bank charges me a flat rate of $2/month +$1/month for producing
an image copy of my checks.  It took me a while to find it, but I
did.  Its called shopping.

Not to pick nits, but TeleCheck probably won't get involved until
1-2 months after the checks were bounced (UNLESS the checks are reported
stolen, then we will attempt to shut you down), and usually only if the 
merchants were guarantee customers (we will pay the merchant for
a bad check he/she accepts based on a TeleCheck approval).  Furthermore,
if you write a bad check on a customer of SCAN (TeleCheck's evil
competitor), we won't think twice about you.  

Secondly, most banks will automatically resubmit checks several
times to cover temporary short falls.

Unfortunately, what most people term e-cash isn't e-cash.  The problems
associated with bringing up the electronic equivalent of cash are
gigantic.  I for one, have a new found respect for Chaum and the rest of
the pioneers in the field.

Citibank and MasterCard are developing an "internet" ways for you to use 
your credit cards, not e-cash.  Microsoft is developing ways to pipe that
information to them.  These are not going to solve the problem, especially
at 18.9% A.P.R...
