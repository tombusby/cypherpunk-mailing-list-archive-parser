   one point to add to the discussion of pioneers, "evangelists" and 
"prophets" in this thread:

   1.  they were all ahead of the curve --yes, they were visionaries. 
       almost all were pushed aside as it became a "business."

   2.  most were pioneers: a specific example is Bob Norris who walked
       out of a Fairchild board meeting being being rejected for his 
       eighth try at replacing Germanium because the first seven had
       failed. A couple of VCs, among them Arthur Rock and Bob Perring
       said: "...we believe you, let's try silicon..." and we have Intel.  

       But, who drives Intel today? --Grove, who is labelled as the
       founder.  Grove made the _business_ -the brains have been 
       forgotten. Norris was the darling of the VCs for a couple years
       until they figured he couldn't spot a _financial_ success.

This same scenario was repeated at Apple, and hundreds of others. Grove
was an exception to the rule that the startup management, quite often
including developers, is replaced by plain vanilla suits. Why even the
evangalistic and prophetical developers?  --because they don't deviate
from their vision to comply with the soley profit oriented modes of the
new marketeers. 

I look at it this way: our nation runs on _money_, whether we like it or 
not (I don't). Money for the sake of money is evil money as it gives 
nothing in return, particularly when everything is to be produced as 
cheaply as possible for more profit to the money folks.

Reminds of two excellent quotes from John Ruskin:

 "He who buys for price alone is this man's lawful prey."

 "The price of oats is significantly lower after processing by the horse." 

I write code because I enjoy it -even it is addictive.
