I don't dislike this idea, so my comments here are only possible routes for
those who want to get PGP-encrypted mail.

First, I think Hal Finney was offering at one time to remail the list to
anyone in encrypted form (encrypted on his machine(s) to their PGP key, of
course). This would increase the volume of PGP mail, of course.

Second, others could make the same offer.

Third, remailers could be used.

Now encrypting a public list doesn't do much, of course, but it does
increase the amount of encrypted traffic.
