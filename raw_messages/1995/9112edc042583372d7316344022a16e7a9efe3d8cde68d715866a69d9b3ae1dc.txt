Hi.  I'm a freshman at the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science
and Technology in Fairfax County, Virginia.  I am writing a (general)
report on cryptography for school, and I was wondering if anyone on
this list that works with cryptography in their job would be able to
give me a short interview over email.  Thanks a lot!
