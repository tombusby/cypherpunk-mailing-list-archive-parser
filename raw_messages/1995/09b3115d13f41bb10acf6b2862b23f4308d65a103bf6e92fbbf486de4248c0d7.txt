I think the point here is that its not safe to send credit cards
over the net and just like in rl, you got protect yourself by keeping
a close eye on your credit card transactions. And to prove to
our governments that RSA40 isn't a 'good enough' any more.

On the other hand getting access to 120 workstations should'nt be to
difficult for any system admin. Take my school for example, I could
run the program on some 100 odd SGI Indy workstations, 2 SGI challenge S's
and a challenger DM (2cpus) along with 2 DEC Alphas

As long as I set it to a have high nice value, nobody would notice, or even
mind.
