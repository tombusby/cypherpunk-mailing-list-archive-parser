The 1st says "Congress shall make no law..." and you are right, the
founding fathers meant to leave the states free to do as they pleased.

However, the 14th amendment says "...No state shall make or enforce
any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens
of the United States...."  This has been used to enforce Bill of Rights
protections against state laws.
