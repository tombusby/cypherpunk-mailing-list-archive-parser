	For those who don't know, the PSX is a CD based gaming console
released (in the US) in Sept by Sony.  It's a MIPS R3000/25MHz processor
with some SGI-designed polygon chips, 2x CD-ROM, 1M RAM, 2M video RAM.

	As for serial port, why bother with the game port when there's
a serial I/O port on the back (the link cable that lets you hook two
PSXen up to play head to head (Mmmmm, Destruction Derby)).  What would be
_really_ spiffy would be for Sony (or a 3rd party) to put out a "hack disk"
(for lack of a better name) that would have a bare bones kernel that you
could then download stuff from another platform (gcc cross-compiled from
your linux box for example).  Like that'll happen.

	The line between toy and real machine is getting more and 
more fuzzy (we use a box here at work with the same processor to compile
for an AT&T telephony switch (which tells you how sad the AT&T product
is :) :))).  How long until the NSA tries a Chinese Lottery attack hidden
inside a Nintendo cart?

	Ah well, I've rambled enough.
