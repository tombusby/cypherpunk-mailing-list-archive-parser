Hi All

You were all so helpful with my last request, I figured
I would go for broke and ask for more advice.

The physical security of my computer isn't really that great,
so I've been interested in finding utilities that would 
securely delete the files I want deleted (as well as temp
files created, etc.).  I run Win 3.1 on DOS 6.  What do 
people think is the best free/shareware file wiping utility
(now, there's a Freudian name...) out there?  How about for
deleteing that pesky Windows Swapfile?   I know--best of all
worlds I remain in DOS, but this isn't always practical.  Any
advice would be appreciated.

Please cc me directly in your response as I've moved over to
Cypherpunk-lite.

Thanks again!

Cassiel
