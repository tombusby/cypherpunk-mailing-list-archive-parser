I had the impression that there were email / WWW gateways -- are there not ?
If there are, could someone send me (privately) info, and I'll try to sort
out an easy way to do it.

Failing that, email me with either:

	Subject: Request for brute keyspace

	request 20 segments

or

	Subject: ACK for brute keyspace

	ACK        2977 3659 0ce1 1 no


(some indication of number of email only people who would like to participate
 would be useful. Email me (not CP!) with a subject line of "offer for brute"
 giving your total k/s rate so I know how much power thgere is out there
)
