Actually, this strikes me as a worst case scenario as far as promoting
cryptography goes. Don't get me wrong--I have no interest in telling
people they can't look at whatever pictures they want, or prevent others
from selling those pictures to them. But...to make such a close
association between what Joe Public considers degenerate trash and
cryptography.... 

The "cause" will do much better if the first major association is made
with something much less controversial. Girl Scout cookies, say.
