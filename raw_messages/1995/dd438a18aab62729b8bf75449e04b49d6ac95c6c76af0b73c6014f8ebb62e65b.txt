While there may be something said for Perry's technical expertise, that
certainly doesn't excuse his rudeness.

That all depends on what you are expecting in a development environment, and
what the goal of the development project is.  If your goal is to quickly
produce a GUI interface, then Windows and VB is indeed the way to go.  VB
has reasonable debugging facilities built in.  Not quite as good as gdb,
but reasonable.

If your goal is to produce non-GUI code, then UNIX offers a superior development
environment.

No operating system can be all things to all people (much as Bill Gates would
like that to happen).  Most UNIX systems suck at doing real-time processing,
and most Windows systems suck at doing anything approaching preemptive
multitasking.  The right tool for the right job - why make one environment
or the other do everything?

I've been hacking UNIX for 10 years, and doing Windows programming for almost
that long, so I've seen both environments, and know that one size *doesn't*
fit all.

It could be argued by some that UNIX is even less user-friendly than
MS-DOS, but that comes from the fact that UNIX wasn't designed to be anything
approaching a production system.  It was written by programmers for
programmers to hack on.

I'd say "UNIX does it *this* way, therefore it's correct ... for UNIX."
Different OS's do things differently.  Windows is designed to hold the
user's hand.  UNIX isn't.
