The U.S. is not likely to find itself relegated to third world status over
this issue. Rhetorically, I wish it were so, but it just ain't. This
issue--like the McCarthy hearings in the 1950s, the race issue in the '60s,
the Vietnam war in the '60s and '70s, to name a few cases, _sounds_ really
serious. And it is, as those cases were, but predicting the imminent
collapse of American civilization is usually a lose.

There is no way the technologlcal and manufacturing prowess of leading
American companies will be substantially crippled.

I would like to see export laws relaxed, especially as they are seldom
effective, and so on. You know my views.

But the likeliest outcome if strong crypto export remains hard, but import
is unaffected, is that strong crypto will be imported from Europe and
elsewhere.

(It does not violate any laws that I am aware of to have a product for sale
in the U.S. with "hooks" for arbitrary crypto, so long as that product and
the hooks are not _exported_. Naturally, companies like Microsoft, Lotus,
Novell, etc., do not want to have a U.S. version and an export version. But
if they _have_ to, they can. My point is that this would certainly not
relegate the U.S. to Third World status, at least not faster than many
other trends are already doing.)

Several European companies are strong in crypto, of course.
