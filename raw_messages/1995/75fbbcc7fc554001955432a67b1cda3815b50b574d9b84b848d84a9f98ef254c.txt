Ah, yes.  Here's another example of the problem with ASN.1.  That field
could equivalently be just a URL for the policy document (or, if short
enough, the policy itself).  However, ASN.1 seduced folks into indirecting
this through some object ID -- bringing all these documents into the one
master hierarchy of things in the world.

Some people just like hierarchies, I guess. :)

Of course not.  In the end, a human needs to make the decision based on
ASCII text.

Yup.
