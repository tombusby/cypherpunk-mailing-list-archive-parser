Danger, Will Robinson!  (see below)

This part sounds good...a sort of master translation service.

Now I get worried.  This communication with the demon is via some IPC --
maybe even via a LAN.  Some things can't be distributed safely and
authentication is #2 on my list.

Crypto keys are #1 on my list of things you can't distribute (unless they
are wrapped, of course).

Public keys, if that's what you're talking about, have perfectly good
nonforgeable names -- themselves.  They are unique.  They are the proper
name which can collect all the attributes of that key which are of interest
(e.g., permission to spend $, name of a human who knows the private key,
attributes about that human, etc.).

I've seen this happen several times.  As a list gets popular, it
diversifies.  You might try sci.crypt.research -- since it's moderated.
