All MOSS does is designate the MIME Headers/etc to support Encrypting
and/or Signing MIME Parts. It says nothing as to how you do the Encoding or
create Signature - only how to package the two parts into a MIME format
once you have them. Thus S/MIME is/could-be an implementation of MOSS (as
would be a MUA that used the MOSS formats to package a PGP signature or
Encrypted Message).
