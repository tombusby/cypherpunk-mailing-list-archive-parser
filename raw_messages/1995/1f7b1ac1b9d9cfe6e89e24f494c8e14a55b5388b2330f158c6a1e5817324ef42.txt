I'm not familiar with this aspect - how do cellular services store and
make use of billing information, as opposed to traditional phone services?

Is this obligation incurred by the contract between the customer and the
cellular service, by statute, or otherwise? Contracts can always be
broken, and passing laws to guard the guardians generally amounts to
having the fox guard the henhouse...

This seems par for the course - the rise of ESS sounded the death knell for
traditional blue boxing. Conversion to digital makes everything easier,
including tracing. Therefore, it behooves us to recognize good and bad
aspects of technology, the better to "take what you can use, and let the
rest go by." (Ken Kesey)

(Whatever happened to Apple's bid to give away a huge chunk of the bandwidth
spectrum? Did the FCC ever get around to addressing their request? As Bill
Frezza said, *that* took cojones...)
