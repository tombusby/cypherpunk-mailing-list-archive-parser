Running a remailer is forbidden by many ISP usage agreements.  Many of the  
potential users of a remailer may not be able to 'pony-up' a few hours of  
remailer operation lest they loose their account.  I thought the idea was to  
get more people using the remailers, not fewer (perhaps just fewer  
abusers)...

Also, users must be aware of a remailer (and have its public key) to use it.   
I suppose you could temporarily add the user to a web page which clients  
checked for a list of current remailers.  However, there are issues of  
reputations of long-running remailers, etc...
