    in other words, business as usual with the Feds. If there is no "book"
on what is or is not legal v/v ITAR, and the agency responsible will not
communicate, it empirically says:  "...well, be reasonable to meet the
intent of the law, but we will not tell you what is really expected;
however, if, in the futute, we decide what we really want, we will bust
you if you did not fully comply despite your good intentions --and, if
that does not fly, we'll charge you with conspiracy...." 

    having been down the road a couple times including being charged with 
technology export for things which are essentially combinations of common 
knowledge, if nothing else works for the Feds, conspiracy will --and it 
carries the same penalties as the "crime" itself.  No small wonder the 
Europeans, including the British, laugh at our "legal" system.
