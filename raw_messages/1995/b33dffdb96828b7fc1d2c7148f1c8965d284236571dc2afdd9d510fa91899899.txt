This technology is very clever and bound to be extremely important.  
But does anyone else think that the price is a little high?  I mean 
the marginal cost can't be more than a few seconds of CPU time for 
each time stamp...

This price tag will temporarily put the time stamp technology out of 
ubiquitous use, where every piece of e-mail, homework paper, Usenet 
post, etc., is automaticly time stamped in a cryptographically secure 
way so that authorship can be asserted and proved.  I think the 
need for proof of authorship is going to become increasingly important 
in an increasingly online world, where copying is so effortless, and 
reputations are based on digital identities.
