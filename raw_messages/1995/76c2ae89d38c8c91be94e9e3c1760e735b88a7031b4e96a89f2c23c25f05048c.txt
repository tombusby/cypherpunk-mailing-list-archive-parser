There is a way to make a file with random contents using PGP.  Just type
pgp +makerandom=xxx file.ext where xxx is the size of the file you want to
create.  I would not advise using this or other methods using a pseudo-
random number generator.

The random output of PGP is pretty random but when the output is used to
generate very large OTP's, patterns will no doubt exist.  Hardware RNG's
are still the best.
