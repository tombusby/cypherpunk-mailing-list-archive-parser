This is an excellent idea, assuming the new CA's key will fit in the same  
amount of space or less than the test CA.  How big is the test key?

Of course, Netscape could decide to remove the test CA certificate from  
future versions of the browser.  However, you could probably replace the  
Verisign certificate with your CA certificate and then have your CA sign the  
Verisign certificate so the browser can still use both.  :-)

I don't think this is necessary as domestic versions of Netscape have already  
been exported and are available on non-U.S. FTP sites...

It only makes it harder to patch.  Anyone with a clue knows that there is no  
such software-only protection that can't be defeated.  Even hardware/software  
dongle type protection can be defeated by altering the software to not check.
