   In restrospect, "daemon" was a poor choice of words to describe my
proposal. "Slave process" gets the idea across much better, but may be a
bit less PC. A daemon sits on a publicly accessible port, such as a TCP/IP
socket. The slave process is only accessible to the user who invoked it
(enforced by the OS's file permissions). Further, it only gives secrets to
individual processes that authenticated themselves first (by sending a
passphrase down the connection to the slave process).

   I'm glad you like it!

   No, the communication is not via a LAN. On a Unix system, the 
communication is through Domain Sockets. Both processes live on the same 
machine, and the socket "lives" on the local file system.

   I submit that my proposal is every bit as secure as, say, PGP is now. 
If you can't trust the operating system not to hand domain sockets from 
one process to another, then you certainly can't trust it to, for 
example, substitute different binaries for the crypto program (an attack 
which Ian et al cleverly mounted a few weeks ago).
   If it were not the case that my proposal was as secure as PGP, then I 
would want to withdraw it. However, the proposal has so many advantages 
that I would want to see a serious description of the attack, rather than 
just feelings of endangerment to Will Robinson.

   I should have made it cleaer that I am referring to public keys. If 
public keys are on the list of things that can't be distributed, then I 
believe we are in trouble.

   Ok. But public keys have one serious disadvantage: their size. I can't 
put a public key on my business card or read it over the phone. I want a 
unforgeable key name. I want this to be the standard key name in the 
interface between the application and the crypto engine. I want users to 
be able to specify them directly, at the very least to bootstrap the 
public key infrastructure.
   I propose using the MD5 hash of the whitespace-free MOSS 
representation of the public key, in hex. It's simple enough to be 
described in one sentence, but does everything I want.

   Note that PGP 2.6.2 does _not_ allow the use of a public key as the 
name of a public key, unless you do a horrible hack such as replace the 
pubring.pgp file with the one public key of interest. This is a 
significant problem when trying to identify which key signed a signed 
message. I haven't bashed around with TISMOSS enough, but I'm not sure it 
will allow this either. I got the impression that it preferred the use of 
an alias.

   Thanks for the suggestion. However, my concerns are with 
implementation and deployment, not research.  I am perfectly willing to 
consider cryptographic algorithms to be black boxes that do what they say 
they will. I think the charter exists to start a new list. John Gilmore 
has already offered to start a "coderpunks" list on toad.com. Shall we 
take him up on it?
