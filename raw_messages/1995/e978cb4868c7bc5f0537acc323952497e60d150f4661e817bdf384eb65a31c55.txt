Dear Cypherpunks,

   This is mostly an old post that Monty Harder sent me
concerning my
program Superwipe. I got his ok to post it to Cypherpunks so
that it
would stimulate debate on my program.

   In addition to the original problem of wiping compressed
sectors, I
have found a second problem: with cacheing software and the
now
ubiquitous several hundred k hardware ram caches, it is
about impossi-
ble to do multiple wipes on sectors. Anyone else got any
ideas?

cluster).

public domain.

That would be

code with the
