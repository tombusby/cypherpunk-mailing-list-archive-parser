So Alice/TheBank are able to tell that the nym whom Alice gave the coin to
is the same as the nym who deposited it.  If Bob has a pseudonymous
account at the bank, and it was the same pseudonymous account that he used in
the transaction with Alice, then they haven't learned anything new, but if he
wants to use one pseudonym when dealing with Alice and another to deposit the
coin he got from her then he has problems.


That's the extent of the damage, right?  Seems like it can be prevented by
laundering the coin through a single pseudonym first.  That is:  Bob receives
the coin from Alice, calling himself "CyberBob".  He deposits the coin with
the bank as a one-time-nym "Nym#2837004", then he has that nym withdraw the 
same amount of money from its account (closing out the account) and transfers
it to the nym which will actually keep the money, "NormalBob".  He destroys 
the new blinding factors after the temporary nym has withdrawn the coin, 
he deposits the coin with the bank as "NormalBob", and now he is in the clear.


Am I missing anything?


If Bob's transaction with Alice was actually pseudonymous rather than
anonymous then he can just deposit the coin using the same pseudonym and they
haven't learned anything new.  Once he has done that he can safely transfer
the money to any other nym of his with no risk (except for traffic analysis,
physical surveillance, yadda yadda yadda).


So current (DigiCash "ecash") Chaumian protocol leads to complete 
anonymity/pseudonymity (there oughta be a word for that.  
"self-nym-control"?) in the case that pseudonymous accounts are allowed at
the Bank.


Now one could move this "double-blinding" (isn't that phrase already in 
use?) trick into the cash protocol itself, possibly gaining a performance 
win.  DigiCash is apparently aware of this possibility, but (rightly) 
doesn't consider it important to develop right now.
