this *is* fraud, in a way. Microsoft is shipping a product which in a
certain exchange claims to be a product of another company. Microsoft's
software is being treated better around the net because it is recognised
as Netscape, which it isn't.

It would be somewhat like me walking through the short line at Heathrow
as a EU citizen even though I'm actually a Canadian citizen.

If Microsoft had used "MSIE 1.0 (...)", then they would have to gain
"market share" in convincing the web that their browser is worth writing
content for. As a side note, there are suggestions that httpds should be
a little more intelligent about HTML, recognising which clients can handle
which versions of html [so that they would ship 1.0 to those which can
handle 1.0, 2.0 to those which think they can handle 2.0, and perhaps we
have a 2.0-netscape-ENHANCED-ha-ha-ha]. If this were to be encouraged by
both httpd creators and client creators, with both sides being honest,
then uSoft would not need to claim to be shipping Netscape. They could
just say html-2.0-microsoft-ENHANCED-ow-my-sides [e.g.] and servers could
check the 2.0 and pay attention to the rest if they wished. [On a side
note, if all governments decided to close up shop tomorrow, many people
on this list would be happy. Which is more likely?]

http, from my meagre understanding, is supposed to be a negotiation (among
other things) with both sides agreeing on what the client can handle and
what the server can offer. Perhaps Microsoft could be encouraged to be
honest about what they are shipping. (I don't doubt that other clients
may also lie about who they are.)

ps - Life might be a lot easier for everyone on the web if Netscape forced
     uSoft software to be honest about what it is.
