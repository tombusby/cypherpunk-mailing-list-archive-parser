I'm not so sure....Checked the fees/interest lately?

OK, but I had an idea a number of years ago. It's not too new,
either, and considering the BILLION$ in credit-card fraud, I think
the credit card companies could implement it with little trouble at
every site the cards are used. Why not PIN numbers. Banks and their
customers are already used to them, they could be entered over the
phone (I know, not too secure) or in person, and considering the
dollar ammount of the current fraud, they would be cheap (I think).
[There is probably a flaw in my idea, but I haven't found it.]

Probably so, but imagine being a Netcom customer 
(or a Netcom stockholder).
Not all of the costs of crime are monetary.
