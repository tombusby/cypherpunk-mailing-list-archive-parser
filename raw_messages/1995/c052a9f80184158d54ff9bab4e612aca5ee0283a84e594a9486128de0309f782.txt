   "Software May Dry Up Money Laundering."

      Can artificial intelligence be used to combat crime by
      ferreting out money laundering? Officials at law
      enforcement, defense and intelligence agencies like to
      think so. They have suggested creating a sophisticated
      computer program to screen records of the more than
      700,000 electronic money transfers involving U.S.
      institutions each day and to flag suspicious ones for
      further investigation. By using AI, they hope to stop
      some of the $300 billion in profits from drug deals and
      other illegal activities that they estimate is laundered
      world-wide each year. But in a report issued yesterday,
      the congressional Office of Technology Assessment says
      any such plan would face considerable obstacles.
