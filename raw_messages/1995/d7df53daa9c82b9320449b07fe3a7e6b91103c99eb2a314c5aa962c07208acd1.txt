Unfortunately, my PC's disk died several months ago so I don't have one
right now.

pgppadt.pl sets the output file name with:
open (OUT, ">$ARGV[0].pad") || die ("Couldn't create $ARGV[0].pad\n");

This doesn't work on DOS since it appends .pad to the input file name so
it doesn't fit the 8.3 character format.

The other errors you are getting are probably due to the difference
between binary and ascii I/O mode on DOS.  I forgot about that
in my test script.  Try this revision of pgppadt.pl, and let me know if
it works on DOS:

----------------------cut here------------------------------
# Test program for pgppad.pl, showing how to use it.
# Revised 2/5/95 for DOS legality
# Usage: perl pgppadt.pl infile <bytes-to-add>
# Output file is infile, stripped of extensions, with .pad appended.

require 'pgppad.pl';
 
open (IN, $ARGV[0]) || die ("Couldn't open $ARGV[0]\n");
$outfile = $ARGV[0];
$outfile =~ s/\..*//;
open (OUT, ">$outfile.pad") || die ("Couldn't create $outfile.pad\n");
binmode IN;
binmode OUT;

$padding = $ARGV[1];
 
@stat = stat(IN);
$size = $stat[7];
print "Input file $ARGV[0] has size $size bytes\n";
print "Output file $outfile.pad will have size ",$size+$padding," bytes\n";
 
if (($code = &pgppad (IN, OUT, $size+$padding)) < 0) {
    die ("pgppad returns code $code\n");
}
 
close (IN);
close (OUT);
print ("Done\n");
