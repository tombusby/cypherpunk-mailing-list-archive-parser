Really it's hard to answer this because what constitutes a "NEW" act is a 
real question in and of itself.

For example, wire fraud.  Is it a "NEW" crime?  Or just a subset of 
fraud, or mail fraud?

Carjacking... is that a new offense?  Or just a solidification and 
increase of punishment for armed robbery unauthorized use of a motor 
vehicle, possession of stolen property, and grand theft auto?

Check forgery now has it's own offense, but is this distinct from forgery?

Most "new offensives" are simply re-classifications of old offenses or 
efforts to move them into the federal arena.

I think the conception that entirely new acts are often made illegal 
(excepting burning the flag or some such) is an erronious one.
