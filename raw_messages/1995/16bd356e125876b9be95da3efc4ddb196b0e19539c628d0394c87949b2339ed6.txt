i don't mean to be extremely brash, but couldn't one use PGP to provide
encrypted communication with the web.
granted initially everyone with a browser would need there own key to
communicate in an encrypted way - at least until such keys could be
generated on the fly.

since the http "client" format resembles rfc821 message headers and a body,
one could easily use a "hal" remailer type "Encrypted: PGP" header line
plus hash marks "::" to reassemble a compatible http client command.
The same could be done on the server side.
