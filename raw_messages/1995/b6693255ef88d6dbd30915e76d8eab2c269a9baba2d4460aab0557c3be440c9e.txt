My car window was taken out 5 years ago in Saint Petersburg, FL by a golf-ball sized meteorite during the Pleaides Meteor Shower. I still
have the rock, and the glass cost me $100 (the insurance deductable).
Happily, I wasn't in my car at the time, but I no longer think of
meteor damage as a rare event. I've come to believe that Republicans
could be right, for the wrong reason, about SDI. As a Libertarian,
I find the problem of planetary meteor defense/avoidance troubling.
