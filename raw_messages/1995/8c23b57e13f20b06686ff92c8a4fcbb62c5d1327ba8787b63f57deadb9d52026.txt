The individual who posted the first hysterical message about Carol's
alleged spam in a.c-e.n-a leaped to the conclusion that it was being
posted to a large number of groups because one of the newsgroups posted
to had a very low ordinal in the alphabetical list of all newsgroups.

The message itself, which he quoted, was only cross-posted to the
10 newsgroups specified.  I believe the CancelMoose threshold for an
official spam is 50 newsgroups.
