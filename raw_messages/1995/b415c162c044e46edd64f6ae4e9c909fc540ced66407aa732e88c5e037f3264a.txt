  You are making a lot of assumptions here.  Lets say that the browser
software is allowing certificate chaining (browser traverses certificate
issuers until it finds one it trusts, then accepts the entire chain).
There could be an attribute in the certificate that indicates whether
the issuer is certifying it to be a subordinate CA.  Presumably when
Moriarty signs a persona certificate, it does not have this attribute.

  X509 version 3 does support arbitrary extensions.  We are making use of
this feature in Netscape Navigator 2.0.  Giving certificates attributes
such as "how was their identity verified" and "what operations are they
certified for" is an obvious application of this.
