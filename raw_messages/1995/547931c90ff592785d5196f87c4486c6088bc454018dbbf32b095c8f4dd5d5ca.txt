RSA Licenses Commercial Distribution Rights to RSAREF
=====================================================
  RSA announces that it is licensing commercial distribution
  rights of its RSAREF software to Consensus Development, allowing
  for implementation of commercial Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)
  applications.


Press Release
- -------------
  REDWOOD SHORES, CALIFORNIA--JANUARY 9, 1995--RSA Data Security,
  Inc. and Consensus Development Corporation jointly announce today
  at the RSA Data Security Conference that Consensus Development is
  licensing the commercial distribution rights of RSAREF from RSA
  Data Security.

  RSAREF (pronounced "R.S.A. reff") is short for "RSA reference
  implementation" and is a cryptography source code toolkit designed
  to allow developers to create PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail)software
  and other encryption/authentication tools. Until now, RSAREF has
  been an unsupported RSA product approved for use only as part of
  freeware and not-for-profit software applications.

  Consensus Development will now be able to market and license RSAREF
  to commercial software developers, and provide software support and
  future enhancements to the RSAREF source code library.

  This announcement is significant because it is the first program of
  its kind to make the RSAREF implementation of RSA's popular
  patented authentication technology available to commercial vendors.

  "Data mailed, posted, or put on servers on the Internet is
  inherently untrustable today, " said Jim Bidzos, president of RSA.
  "Tampering with electronic documents takes no special skills, and
  leaves no trace.With the availability of RSAREF for both free
  software as well as commercial software there is no need for this
  situation to continue."

  Now that a commercial license to RSAREF is available, applications
  may now be developed and sold that incorporate Privacy-Enhanced
  Mail's authentication and encryption capabilities. Christopher
  Allen, President of Consensus Development adds "The PEM standards
  have been under development for a couple of years and only now are
  coming to fruition. The ability to offer both freeware developers
  and commercial software vendors a license to RSAREF will kickstart
  the adoption of PEM-capable mail software."

  Consensus Development will be creating an email discussion list for
  software developers interested in RSAREF. To join the discussion,
  send a message to <listproc@consensus.com> with the body of the
  message requesting "subscribe RSAREF-DEV-L firstname lastname".


Background
- ----------
  The RSA cryptosystem was invented and patented in the late 1970's
  by Drs. Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, at the Massachusetts Institute
  of Technology, who started RSA Data Security in Redwood City,
  California, in 1982. Digital signatures are produced using the RSA
  Cryptosystem, which is a public-key cryptosystem. Each user has two
  keys - one public and one private. The public key can be disclosed
  without compromising the private key. Electronic documents can be
  "signed" with an unforgeable signature by using a
  document/private-key combination to produce a signature unique to
  the author and particular document. Anyone using an application
  that supports RSAREF and has the public key of the author can
  subsequently verify the authenticity of the document.

  Applications of digital signatures are endless: expense reports,
  electronic forms and purchase orders, contract revisions,
  engineering change orders, even tax returns can be electronically
  signed to speed electronic document flow and eliminate fraud.
  Furthermore, digital signatures can also be used to detect any
  virus before a program is executed, since any change whatsoever is
  detected. One reason that the paperless office has never
  materialized is that paper must still be printed so that
  handwritten signatures can be applied. RSAREF eliminates that
  necessity. Applications supporting RSAREF could have prevented last
  year's computer fraud at Dartmouth College, in which students were
  tricked into missing an important midterm by a fraudulent
  electronic mail message claiming to be from university faculty.
