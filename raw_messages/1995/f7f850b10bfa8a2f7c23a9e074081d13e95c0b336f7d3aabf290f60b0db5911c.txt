Since its inception in 1991, the series of CFP conferences has brought
together experts and advocates from the fields of computer science,
law, business, public policy, law enforcement, government, and many
other areas to explore how computer and telecommunications
technologies are affecting freedom and privacy.

Events planned for this year's conference include:

    - Federal prosecutors square off against civil-liberties lawyers
      in a mock Supreme Court test of the "Cryptography Control Act of
      1996", which criminalizes non-escrowed encryption.
      
    - Authors Pat Cadigan, Tom Maddox, Bruce Sterling,
      and Vernor Vinge divine the future of privacy.

    - College administrators, students, lawyers, and journalists
      role-play scenarios that plumb the limits of on-line expression
      on campus networks.

    - Panels on international issues in privacy and encryption; on the
      struggle to control controversial content on the Internet; on
      tensions between copyright of digital information and freedom of
      expression; on threats posed by electronic money to law
      enforcement, privacy, and freedom; on mass communication versus
      mass media.
