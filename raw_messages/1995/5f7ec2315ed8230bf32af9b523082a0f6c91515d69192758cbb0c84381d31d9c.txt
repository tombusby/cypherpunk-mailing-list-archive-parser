With multiple heirchical servers, you don't have the same bottleneck 
problems. If you have a random mode that you can switch into, same deal
(if you care to use it). There are a lot of people who want the anonymity
and server-independance of random mode. There are people who don't want
to add another 37% onto the processing time, given the unlikeliness of
a D.O.S. attack on the server. I continue to support the idea of a 
two-pronged attack using both methods.

Given that most of the server bottleneck was un-updated clients anyway,
I think that the bottleneck-on-the-server problem is solved anyway, 
meaning there won't be any problems getting new keys - thus eliminating
the need for a keyspace buffer queue.
