Just a technical note, but a normal distribution of digits (i.e. 'no digit 
more frequent than any other') is no inidication of either randomness or 
'good' encryption.  A better test is to look for a normal distribution at 
all scale levels.  For example, the following text block: "UUU" (in ASCII) 
has a normal distribution at the bit level "0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 0101",
but not at the byte level.
