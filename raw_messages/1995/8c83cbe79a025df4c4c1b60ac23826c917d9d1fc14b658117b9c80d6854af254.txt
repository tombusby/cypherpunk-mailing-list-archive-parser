-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Howdy, me again.  In keeping with my wish to make PGP signing of 
transmissions simple and commonplace, I've got another script for y'all.  
This is for the Tin Newsreader.

I hope you find it useful.

Comments appreciated.

# TinSign v1.0
# Written by Robert A. Hayden <hayden@krypton.mankato.msus.edu>

# Based in part on the PGP editor wrapper, Version 1.0 (editpgp)
# Copyright (c) 1994, Mark Lewis <nostra@city.ac.uk>.

# TINSIGN is a simple program that will allow you to automatically sign
# your news messages composed with the TIN 1.2pl2 news reader.  It
# may also work with other news programs, but it has not been tested.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING TIN
#
# You need to define the following options in Tin.  This is done via 
# editing the $HOME/.tin/tinrc file.
#
#	A)	start_editor_offset=ON
#	B)	default_editor_format=<path to this script> +%N %F
#		Example:  /users/foo/bar/tinsign +%N %F
#	C)	default_sigfile=/dev/null
#		NOTE:  	I have been unable to get my copy of tin to read 
#			any file other than $HOME/.signature, no matter
#			what this parameter is set to.  The solution I 
#			found was to remove $HOME/.signature and create
#			another file that is read in by defining the
#			variable below.  You may want to experiment with
#			this to find out what works best for you as this 
#			might be a bug specific to our local compilation.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING TINSIGN
#
# The PGP program must be in your path, and the PGPPATH environment
# variable must be defined.  See the PGP documentation for details.
#
# In addition to PGP and the editor you define, TinSign also will use the 
# following programs:
#	awk
#	cat
#	echo
#	egrep
#	mv
#	rm
#	sleep
#
# Double check that the first line of this program points to sh.
#
# Execute the command "chmod 700 <path/to/tinsign>".
#
# Edit the SIGPATH and TINEDITOR variables to point at your signature
# (if any) and the editor you wish to use for your Tin messages.  Default
# signature will be the file .signature-tin in your $HOME directory.
# Default editor is pico -z -t.
#
# Define SIGPATH=/dev/null if you do not have an ASCII signature to 
# append.

SIGPATH=$HOME/.signature-tin
TINEDITOR='pico -z -t'

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING TINSIGN
#
# When you compose a message, you will compose your message as normal.
#
# When you exit your editor (control-X in Pico), you will receive a 
# prompt asking for your PGP passphrase.  Type this in.  
#
# At this point, if you have defined one, your ASCII signature will be 
# appended to the message AFTER the digital signature.
#
# You will then be put into the Tin menu asking if you wish to edit your 
# posting some more, quit the post (ie, abort it), or post it.

### DO NOT TAMPER BELOW THIS LINE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING ###

# Define internal variables
	filename=`echo $2 | cut -f$# -d' '`
	tmpdir=/tmp

#Run editor
	$TINEDITOR +$1 $2

# Split the headers from the body of the article
        awk '{ print }; /^$/ { exit }' $filename > ${tmpdir}/tmp$$.hdr
        awk 'body == 1 { print }; /^$/ { body=1 }' $filename > ${tmpdir}/tmp$$

# Remove "--"
	egrep -ve '^--$' ${tmpdir}/tmp$$ > ${tmpdir}/tmp2$$
	mv ${tmpdir}/tmp2$$ ${tmpdir}/tmp$$

# Sign the message
	pgp -sat +comment="PGP Signed with TinSign 1.0" +clearsig=on ${tmpdir}/tmp$$
	if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
	        cat ${tmpdir}/tmp$$.hdr ${tmpdir}/tmp$$.asc > $filename
	else
	    echo ""; echo "*Error in signing. Aborted."
	    sleep 5
	fi

# clean up any files in temp space
        rm -f ${tmpdir}/tmp$$.hdr ${tmpdir}/tmp$$.asc ${tmpdir}/tmp$$

# append your ASCII signature to the message
	echo " " >> $filename
	cat $SIGPATH >> $filename
