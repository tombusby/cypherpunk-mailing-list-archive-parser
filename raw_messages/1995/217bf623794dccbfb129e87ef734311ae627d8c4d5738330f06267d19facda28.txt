I helped David get a compiled version of a .DLL, but it was way too
raw to use. Specifically, all we did was make a DLL of all of the code,
exporting all of the subroutines. A usefull .DLL would only publish
the "important" ones, and leave the internals hidden. The selection
of which routines need to be classified as "important" is a bunch of
work. Additionally, I expect that some of the routines would really be
better off with a wrapper that made less of their internals visible.
All quite doable, but a non-trivial effort. I know I'm too busy to
attack it.

There are sources to a simple terminal emulator in the MSVC samples
directory. Changing it to use sockets wouldn't be all that hard.
Last time I looked, comt didn't work under NT, and so I stopped looking
at it.

There are also terminal emulators in the code in at least two books,
Monk's Windows Programmer's Guide to Serial Communications,
and Nelson's Serial Communications, a C++ developers's Guide.
Since I'd much rather write C++ than C, I prefer Nelson's.

I use ewan as a terminal emulator, got it from cica or wustl, I forget
which. Dunno if sources are availavle.

SKey would work if you are talking to a unix box that you can get
the admin to change.
