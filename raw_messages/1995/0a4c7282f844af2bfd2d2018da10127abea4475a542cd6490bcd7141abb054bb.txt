[All the rest of ye can delete this message now, with my sincere apologies,
and return to the regularly scheduled flamewar. <Regarding just how hard it
is to actually hit the "delete" key when a message ye don't want appears,
as opposed to posting yet *another* message.>]

HEAR YE, HEAR YE,  the inaugural meeting of South Florida's Brew Crew O'
(Cypherpunks), is scheduled for Saturday, August 12 at Ye Olde Riverwalk
Brewery in Ft. Lauderdale.

Good ale, good discussion and good friends will hopefully be a highlight of
the fest.  And should the invited Dark Knights (cops) arrive [we're
expecting one] a lively jousting contest will ensue (the loser will be
ceremoniously placed in the C-punk stockade and force fed Clipper Chips).
Should Sen. Exon, the evil Sheriff of Congressham (or was that
Congresspork?) attend our noble round table, we will have a hanging in the
town square, preceded, of course by the traditional legume toss. [Beano,
anyone?]

There will be a short speech by my friend Ginger <Phiberflea@aol.com> who is
fresh back from Las Vegas-shire and the DefCon III convention.  She will
describe what it's like to be one of the few wenches at a conference full of
male hackers [guys, it looks like we're all in for some trouble!]...

If one of ye brings a PGP-infested notebook, there may even be a keysigning!
We can even discuss the recent "spooky" psoting to the list.

Anyway, _everyone_ is invited!  Peasants, squires, lords and ladies, jesters,
knights, and royalty, a chair and ale await ye all. Feel free to invite any
south-Floridians not on the list. No need to RSVP, (ye olde e-mail box is
full-to-overflowing already), just show up around 5:00 and have fun!
