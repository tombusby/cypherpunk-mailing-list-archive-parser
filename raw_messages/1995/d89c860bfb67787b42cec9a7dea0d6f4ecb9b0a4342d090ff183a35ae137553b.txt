I haven't actually compiled the code (it's not very DOS-friendly), but it looks
easily modified; some parts of the problem are still hard, such as identifying
the client to the server.  Some issues to deal with for adding authentication:

0) RSAREF2.0 would have been nice, and comes with D-H and DES.

1) The option negotiation is simple but hard-coded; it would be easy to add
one thing at a time, but would benefit from a more flexible option-negotiator.
That would also let you pretend it was just a general-purpose telnet-with-
various-processors and avoid ITAR restrictions for the
authentication-plus-compression
bones version, but the authors, not being Yankees, don't have to worry about
that.

2) Authentication means that some process on each machine is willing to make
a digital signature using a private key - how do you store that key safely?
For a client operated by a human, that's not a big problem; for a server,
or a client operated by a program without a direct user-interface, it's harder.
Do you just leave the key in a file (trusting root?)  Do you only start the
server daemon by hand?  For most Unix applications, I suppose a root-read-only
file containing the key is OK, since if a cracker can read that file you've
got far more serious problems (and the cracker can take over your email anyway.)

3) One big difficulty in authentication systems is securely but conveniently
exchanging authentication parameters; you don't want to risk man-in-the-middle
by trusting keys you got from the other side (otherwise you could use plain
D-H),
but getting keys from a keyserver is slow and hard to integrate, and
requiring the other side to already have your key parameters limits your
usefulness.  

3A) How do you know who you're talking to so you know which authentication data
to use?  For the client, that's pretty easy - the client knows it's calling
server@foo.bar.edu, so it can get the keys in advance and not worry.
(It still needs the PGP web-of-trust or X.509 hierarchy to validate the keys.)
But how does the server know who the client is?  IP address?  What if it's
spoofed?
What if it does a DNS lookup, which gets spoofed?  You could use a password-file
equivalent, but that does mean you can only send mail to people who trust you?

3B) How do you do error recovery in PGP, i.e. you either can't find the
other side's
keys, or can find them but can't validate them because you don't have a web
of trust
that gets from you to them.  Do you just fail the call?  (That's secure but
boring.)
If you complete the call anyway, that means there's a major security risk,
which is that Bad Guys can spoof keys by sending you keys you can't validate.

3C) If you use X.509 hierarchical certification, you _can_ just hand across
the certificate instead of waiting for a PGP keyserver to respond, since the
web of trust is built-in if you're part of the same hierarchy, but there's
still the problem (for the server) of knowing whose certificate to use.
