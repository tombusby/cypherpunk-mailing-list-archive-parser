I wonder if you even know what the IETF is, since you seem to be
waving around an organization I work in like it was a mass of chicken
entrails.

If, Mr. Anonymous, you can get a postscript interpreter to do I/O
after you have stripped all the system calls that do file I/O out of
the C code for the interpreter merely by invoking the names of the I/O
commands in the postscript books, you have managed a feat beyond mere
spoon bending and ought to be studied by the parapsychologists.

In any case, Netscape doesn't write the postscript interpreters and
doesn't have built in support for postscript and doesn't ship mailcap
files that deal with postscript, so I'd say you are a crank worth   
ignoring.
