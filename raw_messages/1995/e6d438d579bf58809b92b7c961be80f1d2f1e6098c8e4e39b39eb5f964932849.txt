It sounds like you are afraid of getting a negative reputation.
Well don't be.  Simply create a persistent pseudonym and sign your
messages with it instead.  That way, if it turns out that everyone
disagrees with you and/or flames you to death, you can simply
disgard your old pseudonym.  Otherwise you keep your pseudonym and 
continue to post under it.  This technique is not new, so you may 
already have seen it in the archive.

Logically, a pseudonym is simply a public key.  However you may want
to give it a human-readable name so other people may more easily refer 
to it.  If you decide to do this, I suggest that you do not name the key 
on its first post because there is a high probability that you will decide 
to disgard the key.  If you name it and throw it away, then you have
unnecessarily cluttered up the limited name space.
