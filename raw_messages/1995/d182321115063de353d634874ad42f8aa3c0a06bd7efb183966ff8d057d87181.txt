In this context is the merchant defined as the the corporation selling the
physical good for delivery or the corporation that is operating the server?
These two parties under certain circumstances may be the same party, but 
in this example lets assume they are seperate entities.

If I am interpreting "internet based stores" in the proper context, the 
cardholder and the bank have recourse against the company operating the 
server.  Is this correct?
