Geez, thanks. He quoted me in an article on the C&S problem long ago. 
I had a legitimate beef because my service provider dutifully kept
many empty newsgroups around just in case someone discovered them.
C&S did and I literally spent 2 hours unsubscribing from all of them.
I seem to remember that he quoted me as being really inconvenienced,
which is pretty much what happened to everyone else.

You are correct, though, about this. They seem to draw much more 
unsuspicious attention then a pair of disbarred attornies should
get. Of course, all attornies deserve caution and suspicion.
