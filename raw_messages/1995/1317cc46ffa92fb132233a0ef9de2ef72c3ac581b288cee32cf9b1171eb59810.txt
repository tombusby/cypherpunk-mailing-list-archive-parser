I have been looking at a number of SSLTelnet/FTP programs (available from
utopia.hacktic.nl by the way) and they would seem to all require Netscape's
library. Anyone know about this?

I found the following link for SSLRef but I was just wondering if it
was the only way to implement SSL telnet&ftp. I would hate to see
people not be able to use them simply because there's no illegal copies
available. 

  URL: http://home.netscape.com/info/sslref.html

If anyone knows of any clones or foreign sources please speak up.
