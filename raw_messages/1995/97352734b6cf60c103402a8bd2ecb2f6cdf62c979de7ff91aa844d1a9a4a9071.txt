Similarly there is an awful lot of other stuff that is left wide
open by default, most notably important parts of the registry, in particular
\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE 

Permissions on this are usually set to give every use write access, so that
every user can install software.  None of the installation programs
reset their registry key to exclude write access by anyone other than
the administrator or the person installing the program, as a result any
user can muck with the environment of any program installed by any other user.

As a result any user can force feed most programs strings which the 
program would ordinarily assume are internally generated, and can therefore
be trusted.  A low privilege user can muck with the internals of a program
installed by a high privilege user.

This of course is a bug in the installation programs, rather than a bug 
in the operating system, but it is an almost universal bug.

(But before you Unix folk gloat, consider how few Unix programs *have*
installation programs, also that Unix has no registry security problem
because it has no registry.)
