Just for what it is worth, there has been considerable speculation as
to the fate of -AB-, whoes real login was tc@alumni.caltech.edu.  The
real world name was supplied by Caltech to the LAPD who, it seems, 
turned it over to the scientologists.  Caltech has been trying to 
contact this person for some time now, after being presented with a
very irregular written request to turn the backup tapes on this act
over to the CoS reps.  CoS upper management has long showed the 
willingness to kill (as exposed by affidavits) but has failed in the
"execution" phase.  It really makes me wonder if they managed it
this time.  Keith Henson
