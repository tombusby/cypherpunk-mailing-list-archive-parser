As I said, Fred, quit giving me "second chances"; either send the
process server with the court papers or let the matter drop. Don't
bother sending any more "just one more chance" messages to me -- I
won't be altering my opinion.

As for apologies, I have nothing to apologize for, so I have no
intention of apologizing to you -- ever.
