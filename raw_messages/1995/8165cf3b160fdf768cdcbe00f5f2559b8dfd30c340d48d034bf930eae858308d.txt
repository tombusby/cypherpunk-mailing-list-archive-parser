So Hal thinks that it would take a lot of work to get a private exponent
that is even marginally short?
 
Let n be the random number generated by keystrokes.
Let m be n mod (0x10001 * 8 * 9 * 25 * 49).
Let s be m mod 0x10001.
Let n1 be n + 0x10000 - s.  Let t be m + 0x10000 - s mod 8 * 9 * 25 * 49.
Let t2 be m mod 8, t3 be m mod 9, t5 be m mod 25, t7 be m mod 49.
Let n2 be n1 / 2, n3 be n1 / 3, n4 be n1 / 4, ... n7 be n1/7.
 
using t's, determine if n1 is a mult of 2, 3, 5, 7.
if so, check appropriate element of {n2, n3, n4, n5, n6, n7} for primeness.
(there may not be one).
if not check n1.
EndELSE
 
Loop:
Determine if some element of {n1,...n7} is prime 
If so, let d = (n1 + 1 ) / 0x10001
     [equiv: n1/0x10001 + 1]
  Let k = 0's in d.
     [check previous flamage for best method]
  If k is below threshhold, save and exit.
     (you may wish to ensure that k is _above_ a certain threshhold...)
EndIF
EndIF
 
Let n1 += 0x10001
using t's, determine if n1 is a mult of 2, 3, 5, 7. 
if so, increment the appropriate elements of {n2, ... n7}.
also, check appropriate element of {n2, n3, n4, n5, n6, n7} for primeness.
  (there may not be one).
if not check n1.
EndELSE
 
EndLoop:
 
:-D
Cypherpunks write algorithms, and argue about operating systems.
 
 
Clearly, if you wish to be a stickler about the number of digits that you
end up with, you wouldn't use n2 through n7.  The t's, however, or some
version thereof, would speed the checking noticably.
