The CSE deserves all the flak that it can get ... especially the village
idjit in "LMN Group", Barry de 'Artful.  Gee is he full of it.  His phone
manners are atrocious, especially for someone *supposedly* in customer
relations. 

I mean are these guys on their toes, or what??  I guess he was just trying
to do a bad Lily Tomlin impression, or they're having a really bad day
over there.  My mistake for demonstrating a willingness to talk.  It 
really was a waste of a quarter.

I guess that I'm not supposed to taunt the poor people at the CSE via
STU-III.  I guess I should have used POTS.  I mean Motorola's STU-III
can't be spoofed, can it??  Especially when we go into SECURE MODE?? 

(btw, that's STRIKE THREE to my Ottawa friends ...)

Hmm, I think they mispelled some stuff on this page.  

It's STU-III ... not STY-III ... guess someone's finger slipped up on the
Y and the U, or something.  Then again, maybe we should be specing Alcatel
over Motorola.  Fewer chances for miscommunications. 

Or maybe Motorola has a couple of new products coming out. I'll bet
whatever they are, they ain't Marrons Glaces, or Beaujolais Villages.
