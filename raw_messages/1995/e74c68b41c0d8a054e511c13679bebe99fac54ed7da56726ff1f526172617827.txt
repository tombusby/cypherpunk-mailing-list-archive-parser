The following is an exerpt is from Jim Warren's listserv, GovAccess 183.

Are there folks on this list who have insights or definitive information on
this topic?

Are there ways for someone with access to modify router tables to constantly
create alternate paths at other routers which would serve to end-around any
such snoops?

Is Someone Already Watching All International Net Traffic?

The following is the transcript of an actual communications trace that a
friend ran, while I was sitting next to him, watching -- reprinted here
with his permission.

He did a "traceroute" of two messages that he sent from his machine in
Switzerland (he'd telneted into it while we were at a computer conference
in California).

Traceroute automatically reports each Internet node through which a message
passes, as it proceeds from origin to destination.

He did two traceroutes.  The first was from Switzerland to an addressee at
Netcom in San Jose, California.  The second was from Switzerland to an
addressee in Israel.

Notice that both messages went through an unnamed site -- 134.222.9.1 and
then a strangely-named site, "lp (134.222.35.2)" -- then through the same
Vienna, Virginia (USA) site ... and thereafter, on to their destination.
I.e., the second message went through Virginia to get from Switzerland to
Israel.

The whois servers at the InterNIC and at nic.ddn.mil for MILNET Information
report, ``No match for "134.222.9.1". '' and `` No match for
"134.222.35.2".''

Now let me see ... which spy agencies are located in or near Virginia?
