I think that a lot of chosen plaintext attacks work regardless of timing
analysis.  For example, there is a well known chosen plaintext attack
against the RSA.  The deeper issue is that all of the efficient
algorithms for modular exponentiation take more time for 1s than for 0s. 
So the way to get security is to sacrifice efficiency (a widely known
but rarely proven reality).
