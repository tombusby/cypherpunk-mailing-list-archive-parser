One minor question, is it possible to set it up so that it is not a final
hop remailer. In other words the remailer is set up to pass its mail on to
another remailer which is the final destination (preferably non-U.S.) If
so, I'm in. I've already got my account on c2 doing three things, what's
one more. If we could make this possible, it could really propagate
remailers as it removes some of the liability from those who can't afford
it.

I would love to run a final hop remailer, unfortunately financially I
barely have enough cash to keep on the net, let alone pay for a lawyer if
needed. Hopefully this is only temporary, (wifey finally found a job, now
it's catch-up time) but I'm unfortunately getting used to it.
