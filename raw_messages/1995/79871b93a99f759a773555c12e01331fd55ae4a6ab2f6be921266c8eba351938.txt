isn't the noise generated by such a diode more accurately described
as chaotic rather than random? i would think that there might be
potential problems with using chaos as a random number source. it
might be somewhat less random than you may think as most chaotic
system's 'noise' operates within definable parameters. (like a lorenz
system). i _would_ think that it would act as a most excellent prng,
but exactly how _truely_ random it actually would be i couldn't say. 
while it may not be _truely_ random, it would most likely be
cryptographically secure though. 

i think generating _true_ randomness is pretty difficult without
measuring something similar to radioactive decay. 

the system that i proposed setting up is, admittedly, a p-otp at
best. i'm much more convinced of this than i was when i initially
proposed it. the comments i've gotten on it were most enlightening.
