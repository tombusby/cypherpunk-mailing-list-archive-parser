F|If all Alice's prospective customers are also resellers on the side, then I

        Hey, Wei, you overlooked something rather simple: suppose
        Alice wasn't any good?  Or suppose she was good, in general,
        but came up wrong at a bad time?  Whereas she might have
        corrected it in time if it had been her client and she had
        direct access, Mallet gets hit broadside out of ignorance--
        and the resulting delay from the extra link in the chain
        could easily be enough to ruin him.
