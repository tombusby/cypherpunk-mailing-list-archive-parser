>On June 27, Senator Grassley (R-Iowa) introduced the Anti-Electronic
>Racketeering Act, S.974.  The bill was designed "to prohibit certain acts
>involving the use of computers in the furtherance of crimes, and for other
>purposes."  Its immediate effect, among other things, would be to
>criminalize the posting of any encryption software on any computer network
>that foreign nationals can access (in other words, any computer network
>period).  Because of poor wording, the bill would probably also criminalize
>data compression and other non-cryptographic encoding schemes available on
>networks.  This includes the compression used in most of the images on
>Internet user's WWW homepages, not to mention uu and binhex encoding for
>transferring binary files via email, and even language encoding used to
>represent non-English characters, such as the SJIS scheme for representing
>Japanese characters.
>
>In addition, the bill seems to be directed at undermining two big fights
>we've successfully waged in the past:  the Steve Jackson Games decision
>against the United States Secret Service and the government's Clipper Chip
>proposal.
>
>Re:  Steve Jackson Games -- this bill would permit the government to avoid
>the notice requirements of the Privacy Protection Act if "there is reason
>to believe that the immediate seizure of such materials is necessary to
>prevent the destruction or altercation [very Freudian sic!] of such
>documents."  Furthermore, the government could use electronic evidence
>seized that had not been particularly described in a warrant if
>
>"the seizure is incidental to an otherwise valid seizure, and the
>government officer or employee-
>
>   ''(A) was not aware that work product material was among the data seized;
>
>   ''(B) upon actual discovery of the existence of work product materials, the
>government officer or employee took reasonable steps to protect the privacy
>interests recognized by this section, including-
>
>   ''(i) using utility software to seek and identify electronically stored data
>that may be commingled or combined with non-work product material; and
>
>   ''(ii) upon actual identification of such material, taking reasonable steps
>to protect the privacy of the material, including seeking a search warrant."
>
>Re:  Clipper Chip -- The bill would make it a crime "to distribute computer
>software that encodes or encrypts electronic or digital communications to
>computer networks that the person distributing the software knows or
>reasonably should know, is accessible to foreign nationals and foreign
>governments, regardless of whether such software has been designated as
>nonexportable."  However, there is an exception:  "It shall be an
>affirmative defense to prosecution under this section that the software at
>issue used a universal decoding device or program that was provided to the
>Department of Justice prior to the distribution."  This is essentially an
>attempt to sneak the key "escrow" provisions of the Clipper scheme in
>through a legislative back door.
>
>Fortunately, the bill does not have a very promising future.  The bill has
>no co-sponsors.  It was immediately referred to the Committee on the
>Judiciary, where it currently sits.  LEXIS's bill tracking report only
>gives it a 10% chance of passing out of the committee.
>
>I thought Senator Grassley's own statement when he introduced the bill is
>worth reading, so I'm attaching it here.  My favorite line is "Elliott Ness
>needs to meet the Internet."  This is especially ironic in light of recent
>comparisons of hysteria about "dangerous" material on the internet, and
>Prohibition.

>>----------  Senator Grassley's Statement to the Senate  ----------
>>
>>   Mr. President, I rise this evening to introduce the Anti-electronic
>>Racketeering Act of 1995. This bill makes important changes to RICO and
>>criminalizes deliberately using computer technology to engage in criminal
>>activity. I believe this bill is a reasonable, measured and strong response
>>to a growing problem.  According to the computer emergency and response
>>team at Carnegie-Mellon University, during 1994, about 40,000 computer
>>users were attacked. Virus hacker, the FBI's national computer crime squad
>>has investigated over 200 cases since 1991. So, computer crime is clearly
>>on the rise.
>*Was this not the same Carnegie-Mellon University involved in the horrific
>Time Ragazine "Cyberporn" article?  The one which will take no
>responsibility for the incredibly poor research done by one of their
>undergraduates?  Which seems to take no stand on proper research procedures
>used by their students?
>>
>>   Mr. President, I suppose that some of this is just natural. Whenever man
>>develops a new technology, that technology will be abused by some. And that is
>>why I have introduced this bill. I believe we need to seriously reconsider the
>>Federal Criminal Code with an eye toward modernizing existing statutes and
>>creating new ones. In other words, Mr. President, Elliot Ness needs to
>>meet the
>>Internet.
>*Being a politician, of course he considers criminality natural.  It goes
>with the territory.  And like so many of them, drunk with their potential
>power over the people (Dear God, let us no longer speak of "servants of the
>People), attacking every single user of computers, world wide at that, is
>also a "natural" response.
>>
>>   Mr. President, I sit on the Board of the Office of Technology Assessment.
>>That Office has clearly indicated that organized crime has entered
>>cyberspace in
>>a big way. International drug cartels use computers to launder drug money and
>>terrorists like the Oklahoma City bombers use computers to conspire to commit
>>crimes.
>*Ah..and notice how he carefully leaves out any empirical data?  This
>Board, whatever the hell it is, "has clearly indicated" something...which
>just happens to fit in with Grassley's political ambitions and desperate
>need to be the center of attention.  And so he raises the unfounded
>"organized crime" and "terrorist" and "conspiracy" flags to frighten us
>all.  And to make matters truly worse, there is no evidence or indication
>that the Internet was even used in the OK City debacle, much less
>encryption.  As a matter of fact, our vaunted FBI has yet to even bring an
>indictment in the case!
>>
>>   Computer fraud accounts for the loss of millions of dollars per year.
>*Mostly through the use of bank wires...not available to the rest of us.
>
> And often times, there is little that can be done about this because the
>computer
>>used to commit the crimes is located overseas. So, under my bill, overseas
>>computer users who employ their computers to commit fraud in the United States
>>would be fully subject to the Federal criminal laws.  Also under my bill, Mr.
>>President, the wire fraud statute which has been successfully used by
>>prosecutors for many users, will be amended to make fraudulent schemes
>>which use
>>computers a crime.
>*I can see it now.  You typed a letter on a computer?  You're dead,
>buddy!!!  And anyone who happened to have received that letter, whether
>involved or not, would also be guilty by association.  Good going,
>Grassley.  Fine grasp of the Constitution there.
>>
>>   It is not enough to simply modernize the Criminal Code. We also have to
>>reconsider many of the difficult procedural burdens that prosecutors must
>>overcome. For instance, in the typical case, prosecutors must identify a
>>location in order to get a wiretapping order. But in cyberspace, it is often
>>impossible to determine the location. And so my bill corrects that so that if
>>prosecutors cannot, with the exercise of effort, give the court a
>>location, then
>>those prosecutors can still get a wiretapping order. And for law
>>enforcers-both
>>State and Federal-who have seized a computer which contains both contraband or
>>evidence and purely private material, I have created a good-faith standard so
>>that law enforcers are not shackled by undue restrictions but will also be
>>punished for bad faith.
>*Oh, Dear God!  He's gonna protect us from the enforcers.  How terribly kind.
>>
>>   Mr. President, this brave new world of electronic communications and global
>>computer networks holds much promise. But like almost anything, there is the
>>potential for abuse and harm. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this
>>bill and that is why I urge industry to support this bill.
>*Oh, yes...let's be sure that any promise is nipped in the bud as our
>sacred government, which has shown such a dandy predilection for abuse of
>power through the years, is given accerss to any and all private
>communications, no matter from whom or to whom.  With a Senator like this,
>who needs a Fuhreur?  I hope Iowans take a long look at this idiot next
>time the ballots are being cast.
>>
>>   On a final note, I would say that we should not be too scared of
>>technology.
>>After all, we are still just people and right is still right and wrong is
>>still
>>wrong. Some things change and some things do not. All that my bill does is say
>>you can't use computers to steal, to threaten others or conceal criminal
>>conduct.
>*And this chump is willing to flush the entire Constitution down the toilet
>in order to save us all from that which can, and will, be done by many
>other means.  Notice his "all my bill does", then defines what he wants us
>to believe.  And this is one of the Republicans who has promised to get the
>Federal government off our backs?  Oh, yes, there *is* a Santa Claus,
>Virginia.  But be very careful of his hands when he gives you that fatherly
>hug.  This one will rape us all if given the chance!
>
