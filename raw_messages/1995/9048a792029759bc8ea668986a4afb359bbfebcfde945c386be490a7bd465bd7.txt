IMHO Microsoft has no concern about the security of any university; educational institutions will standardize on whatever OS the majority of their students are familiar with (=Windows whatever).  

No, the big priority in Redmond is winning (and keeping) corporate customers.  A corporation can standardize around whatever the management likes.  A large Virginia-based metals corporation recently standardized on the M$ Office suite with little regard to the hundreds of users who had already effectively entrenched with WordPerfect.
