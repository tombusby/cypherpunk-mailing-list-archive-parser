I used to have this C source that I could embed in a program, and it
would tell me if the software had been tampered with at runtime.  I've
lost/mislaid/whatever the source, and I was wondering if anyone had anything
that would do the same thing.  As I recall, it calculated a simple CRC and
embedded it into the .EXE file (it was written for MS-DOS).

It doesn't need to be cryptographically secure - I just need to check to see
if the executable has been corrupted.  I've leafed through alt.sources and
comp.sources.*.

Thanks in advance...
