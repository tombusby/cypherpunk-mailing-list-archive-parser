But not non-subversive code?  Sounds like a value judgement to me.
Subversive code is not otherwise defined in these documents.

Is incorrect code subversive?  Vica versa? Does Java provide defenses

Just because it is opaque, doesn't mean you can't happen across a valid
(but perhaps undesirable) handle.  Sounds like a good issue for attack
by crypto-types.  How do we guess the handle of the disk IO routines?

Is the language un-predictable? The same program executes differently
each time? A pseudo-random allocation? What is the technique used to
implement this, and why should we believe it is in fact secure in some
sense.  And if so, in what sense?

What are these "safety rules"?  No reference to them in this document!

Wait a minute.  If it's so safe, what code can possibly be sent in that
would cause a violation? If the prover is so simple, how can it show
things (e.g., program correctness) in real-time on a PC that the rest of
the world can't show with supercomputers over extended periods? What
EXACTLY are these things doing, and why should we believe they are safe?

So there are byte code sequences that can break the interpreter!

Huh? I thought you couldn't have incorrect types.  Do they mean that you
can have incorrect types but that they are detected by the verifier at
load time?

How about legal ones - like converting integers to pointers via case

What exactly does this mean?

Can computers actually "know" anything?

No runtime checking whatsoever.  Get past the supposed verifier, and you
have free run of the machine.  A single verifier bug or inadequacy, and
the world is unsafe for electronic commerce.  And has the Java code been
verified to prove the claimed properties?  Against what criteria?  Where's
the beef?

But they can explicitly reference each other? I can only explicitly open
a file called command.com on your PC?

Who wants to bet that 99+% of all users configure "Allow all network
accesses".  Hot Java today is defaulted to this state.

In other words, it assumes the other three levels worked properly.
If they don't, you're screwed.

You're screwed.

By default - ask the user.  That's restrictive? Please press the OK
button to have our free Lotus update loaded into your computer.

So today, if the admin specifies the proper IP address ranges when
loading Java into each computer in the network, and if no user ever
installs Java on their own, "code" downloads from external machines
may be stopped - unless the user says OK.

How about the more than 99.99% of users who are not knowledgable of HotJava?

The user dictates the security policy.  Any user in your site can
potentially, through error or omission or intent, open up a hole to your
entire network by accidentally pressing the OK button one time or by
setting a configuration parameter incorrectly.  And your firewall will
not save you.
