Dear ETO users,

we are introducing a new service to the ETO systems which relates
to international tenders. The service ETO Tender is also free and
we will disseminate the information via email. The tender data is
always free text so we will not codify the information. Please
send us your national tenders so we can increase the number of
tenders on-line.

With my best regards

Carlos Moreira
