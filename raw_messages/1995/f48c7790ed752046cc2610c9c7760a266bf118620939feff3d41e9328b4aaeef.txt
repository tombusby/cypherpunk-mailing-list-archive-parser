It certainly can be built from RSAREF, as I use my Apple DigiSign X.509 key
(ultimately created with TIPEM in the Mac system software) with RIPEM/Mac
(which uses RSAREF.)

Some additional info: my company, Consensus Development, has commercial
rights to license developers RSAREF also has a good relationship with
VeriSign. We helping them writea variety of tools to make issuing X.509
certs easier.

I've been working on getting RC2/RC4 in object-only exportable size key
form from RSA for RSAREF customers, and Jim Bidzos has agreed in principle.
We have to work out details, however.

I spoke with Eric yesterday and I think he was working on some ASN.1
related classes for a future version of SSLeay.
