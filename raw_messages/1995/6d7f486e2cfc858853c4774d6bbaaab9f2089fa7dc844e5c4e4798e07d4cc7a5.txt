Ron has not mentioned such an event to me and if that were the case I   
would
seriously doubt that he would not have been told about it. The only   
comment
he
generally makes is that he wrote MD5 because "MD4 was making me nervous".

Netscape do not simply use the MD5 of the message, they are using (as I
understand it) the PKCS#1 standard for makoing the signature. If not they   

probably have severe problems.

NIST and the NSA trusted MD4 sufficiently to base SHA upon it. SHA is
preferable
in many ways to MD5, it has a different approach to extending the   
scheduling
and
resist differential cryptanalysis. There is a problem with the compressor   

function of MD5 which I dislike. This is fairly irrelevant though since   
SSL
allows other digests to be used.
