Good idea - if you can pull it off. If you can't, you will create
even more confusion. That is a decision only your conscience can make.

I wouldn't use <letter><number> because that could be confused with
Orange Book security ratings. The RISKS are obvious, as they say.

If you want multi-axis, perhaps something like the Geek code, except
standardized so that severity is apparent even if you don't remember
the letters?

(Eg in the Geek Code "+" is usually good but many people wouldn't look
well on d++ or w+++++ (conservative dress and Bill Gates resp.). You
would want "+" to always be good, for example.)

You also want it fairly short (media) - alternatively make it so that
it is possible to say (eg) "A2" or "A2+dx/g8/b*" depending on how much
detail you want (column space).

A.k.a. "cypherpunks write code".

What's wrong with "a bug in -x- that rated -y- on the Cypherpunk Scale"?
There's already TDM TLAs (that's "too damn many three letter acronyms").

That doesn't rule out a scale: it merely changes how you perceive the
scale.

An earthquake 3.6 on the Richter scale would be no problem if you are
playing poker, say, but "catastrophic" if you are playing mikado.

It also depends on the "Operating System" (building) you are in.

I wouldn't exactly say Soyuz failed; I'd say the main problem was that
they got a leader with a conscience... And you can't have a totalitarian
dictator with a conscience (as you can see).

I would suspect the best answer is "to the general public" or "to the
average user".

If you are not an average user, you reinterpret the rankings to your
liking, making sure that you get more information on those that are
potentially severe to you. It'll still help you by giving you a 
preliminary ranking.

No, that is not necessary. Just like you can say an earthquake measures
3.6 on the Richter scale without making any statements about whether
or not it is "severe".

Not really, you don't need to change the Richter scale just because
buildings have got more solid. The perception of the scale needs to
change, but not the scale itself.

> Also, how do you rate situations where flaws are combined to mount an attack?
...

Then you are asking not for a rating of individual bugs, but overall
bugginess of a product. That can be rated on the same scale or a different
one, but it is a different question.

("A bug discovered in -x- rating -y-, raising the overall bugginess
or -x- to -z-. Film at 10.9959268374")

Then "Vladimir Z. Nuri" <vznuri@netcom.com> responded:

Yup, or if you have long and short versions the long could actually
contain some more useful info.

Do we *mind*? "The internet steals your credit cards - download Magic
Money!" :-)


OK, I guess we do mind.
