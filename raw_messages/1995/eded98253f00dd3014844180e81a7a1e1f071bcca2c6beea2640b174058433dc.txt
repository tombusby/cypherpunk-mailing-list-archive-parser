Actually, Dr. Sol's AVTK is consistently one of the very top DOS virus
scanners, in terms of percent of known viruses it catches.

I can't speak for S&S, but I'd bet that what they are introducing is
a scanner for archives of MS-DOS programs hosted on NT systems.
Although it may be that NT-specific viruses have started appearing.
(The restrictions on file access don't slow the spread of file
infectors all that much -- it's enough for them to infect those things
they have write permission for.  I think the good Dr. Cohen has done
some research on this?)

In any case, this is more appropriate for comp.virus than cpunks.
