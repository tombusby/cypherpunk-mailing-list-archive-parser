if a user on netcom violates the AUP, their account would be 
terminated...if those were the terms of the AUP.

It just so happens the AUP of winternet allows for this situation.

its a bit far fetched to call HIS reaction a tantrum.... If anyone's 
screaming for mommy its whats-her-name....

Big providers like Netcom don't have a 'community' to speak of.

deliver.,..not out of spite

HAhahaha...if you had any idea what you were talking about, you would 
realize you are totally off base.

Winternet is HARDLY a 'bbs'.  Its a regional internet service....much as 
netcom was before they flooded every city with dialups.

Any professional knows better than to read private mail...and if this is 
so...then they aren't worthy of having a site to run

as for PGP, this is an individual thing....I'm sure mike has no such 
objections...i know here at MindVox we don't...in fact, we installed it 
for the users

Who owns netcom's machines?

Once again, you speaketh from your ass....

Netcom is an abomination.....it is the only one of its kind (not counting 
delphi etc, since they were conceived under differnent systems)

Netcom is a Winternet which has grown out of control.

They suck network services off others (irc as one example) and don't take 
responsibilty for the HUGE number of idiots on their service who 
maliciously hack anything they can reach....its totally without 
personality...AND....its slower than molasses...the management is out of 
touch with the users and they are so overloaded with trouble reports, 
they don't know what to do with them.

This has got to be one of the largest loads of crap I've seen tossed on 
this list in the year and a half i've lurked on it.

I'd love to see a response to this...please!

oh...btw...i don't have ANY connection to winternet, other than knowing 
MANY satisfied customers, and having heard alot about them, as a sysadmin 
for a site in much the same situation.
