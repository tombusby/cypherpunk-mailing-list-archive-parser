Monday's rally was canceled on account of rain.  There is now a backup
location in case of rain on Thursday.  Check the web page before you leave,
or come to South Park, and the backup location will be close by.  See you
there!     -- John

                *** NETIZENS!! RALLY AGAINST CENSORSHIP ***

                         Thursday, December 14, 1995
                       at South Park, 12:00 - 1:00 PM
                          San Francisco, California

                           --  Rain or Shine!  --

     **PROTEST ** PROTEST ** PROTEST ** PROTEST ** PROTEST ** PROTEST **


Amendment I: "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble."


     **PROTEST ** PROTEST ** PROTEST ** PROTEST ** PROTEST ** PROTEST **

It's like illiterates telling you what to read. On December 6 members of
the House Conference Committee on Telecommunications Reform approved a
proposal to censor free speech in cyberspace. If the measures are adopted,
the Net and online media will become the most heavily regulated media in
the United States. They *will not* enjoy the First Amendment freedoms now
afforded to print media. Instead, online publishers and users will be held
to a vague and patently un-Constitutional "indecency" standard. "Violators"
will be subject to fines of up to $100,000 and prison terms of up to five
years.

In response, ALL members of the Bay Area media, online, Internet, new
media, and telecommunications communities are invited to participate in a
protest rally to express our outrage that the politicians in Congress
(which is not even connected to the Internet!) are attempting to destroy
our First Amendment rights in cyberspace, and directly attack our
livelihoods.

Help stop the demagogues in Washington! There is nothing "decent" about
denying free speech to us, our children, and our children's children.
Preserve our Constitutional rights! Join us!
