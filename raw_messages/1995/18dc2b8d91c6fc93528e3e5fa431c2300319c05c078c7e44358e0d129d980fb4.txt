I hereby offer to setup an Email-FAX gateway for the DC/N. VA area if
there is enough interest and some way can be found to defray an Internet
feed, phone line, etc.

Unfortunately I live just over the line where a local line to DC costs
$.50/mo....  At my house it costs $100/mo.  However, I have a number
of friends (and could probably find others) that a PC with Linux
and two phone lines/modems could be placed at to handle this.

I might even have a junk PC that could handle it.

Anyone who spends much on DC faxes now could save a bundle...


I'm familiar with setting up the tpc.int software, so it should integrate
well.

I'm way too busy and overloaded to both pay for and completely set this
up however.
