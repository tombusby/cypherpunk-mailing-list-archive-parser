Raph, I mean no offense, but if _any_ request is ever to be deemed
"frivolous," surely submitting a CJR for t-shirts is such a request.

I won't belabor the point that the t-shirt is _at best_ comparable to a
book, which generally needs no CJR (*), and _at worst_ is an illegible,
confusing "work of art." (I personally am miffed at the imprecision of the
"This shirt has been declared to be a munition"--or whatever, as I don't
have one handy to check--and the language of the sales advertisements.)

So the little joke was returned unopened. Not surprising.

No offense intended to all those who think a CJR for a t-shirt is a worthy
cause, but I think it's a pointless diversion.

(* Hal Abelson of MIT says there are possible export problems with the MIT
Press book on PGP, and MIT dropped plans for a version in a special OCR
font. So, I agree that _some_ books cross the line and look like pure
software. However, I continue to maintain that a badly-printed barcode is
just a joke, nothing more.)
