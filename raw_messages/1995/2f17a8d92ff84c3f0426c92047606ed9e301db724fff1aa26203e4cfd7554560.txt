A lot of truth here...sometimes the perfect is the enemy of the good.

After all, only on the Cypherpunks list would you be likely to find general
agreement that setting up a separate Intel box running Linux so one can
create a suitable mail client is the preferred way to do secure e-mail?

(Smileys for the :=)-impaired...I have nothing against Linux, and even
browsed the new O'Reilly book recently. But I'm _still_ glad I'm "just a
Mac user.")

I have no idea what First Virtual's current or future business plans are,
but I do expect more solid encryption, a la PGP or "real" RSA (licensed),
will be coming soon. I assume FV is planning for this likely development.
