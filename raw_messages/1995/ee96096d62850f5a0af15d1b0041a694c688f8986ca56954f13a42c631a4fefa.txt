Yes, but presumably it's expected that they would be using secure
encryption on the messages that they're sending. That might still provide
some information about the message for traffic analysis, e.g. if you send
a PGP message you have your key-id at the beginning, and if you knew the 
keys of all members of the DC-net you could XOR them and see who's 
talking to who.
 
I'd have thought the most significant problem would be reserving the
blocks in an anonymous fashion while not allowing denial-of-service
attacks.
