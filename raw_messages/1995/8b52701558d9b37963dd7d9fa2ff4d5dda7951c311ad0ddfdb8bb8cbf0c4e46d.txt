Worked great in France, right?  No terrorist problems there or anything.

Mr. or Ms. Anonymous here has hit on the nose what irritates me about 
Netscape's attitude.  For them opposing GAK is not voluntarily installing 
it into their software, sending a lackey (who may or may not know squat 
about how to schmooze washington and beltway fever types) to babble at a 
conference, and generally snowjobbing the educated portions of the 
marketplace by claiming to be on their side in opposition to GAK.

I am reminded of a certain dictator of a certain canaled nation who's 
anti-drug rhetoric was the strongest voice in Central and South America 
for a time.

I think it's more about laziness actually.  Netscape would (should) see 
quite quickly that key escrow is going to hurt them in the foreign 
market, and to some extent in the United States.  One would expect them 
to discover this and be screaming bloody murder.

As I have said before, as I will repeat, I'm sure the list is tired of my 
babbling, Netscape has a voice.  If Netscape were to scream and yell that 
GAK is unacceptable, people would take notice.  What does Netscape have 
to lose exactly?  If they still make GAK the law of the land, Netscape 
is, of course, probably going to comply.

_What does that have to do with trying to prevent it from ever being made 
the law of the land?_

I am saddened that the company which has so much power today to further 
the technology, the freedom and velocity of information, and privacy, is 
such a bowl of pudding.

Which is a silly objective considering the inviability of a NSA designed 
escrow system in any foreign market.

Determining the falsehood of this statement is left as an exercise for the 
reader.

Why any company would model their efforts after the French government is 
a complete mystery to me.

Gee, let's make sure they can do it for Netscape too!

Wow.  Where did you learn your economics?

In the alternative, where did you learn your propaganda skills?
This sounds like School of the America's Stuff.

In fact, if Netscape really wanted to do well, they should be promoting 
their product, which I might add has a strong showing in the 18-24/5 
bracket- precisely that bracket likely to fret over government involvement,
as "Crypto so strong, it is banned in (x) countries!"

WOAH!  Now I'm REALLY pleased I sold my stock.

Perhaps, perhaps not.  It sure seems to represent the attitude we can 
expect even from the 'pro crypto' types in Netscape.  If this is the 
limit of your potential....

Jim, and Netscape in general, simply has no idea what-so-ever what kind 
of sword they are carrying.  Someone needs to give them a shot of 
something.

The way you are going, you will.  Why, as you sound so upset about this, 
aren't you DOING something?  Why aren't you out behind a podium pounding 
your shoe with:

"We will not accept GAK, it is wrong, we will bury you."

The time for submission and kissupping, for which there will be MUCH 
time, as AFTER GAK is mandatory.  (Some might argue that this is the time 
for work to have it repealed, but they don't know much about institutions 
in the U.S.)

He is confused.  He knows the issue, he just doesn't know what to do.  
Like a child with a firearm.

Wow.  You have done more damage than you know.

A quick resolution is going to be in your detrement.
