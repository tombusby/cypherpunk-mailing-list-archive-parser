I apologize for being so terse in my first message. This is not a red
herring. The organization that has approached me is very pro-privacy and
anonymity. I see nothing but good coming from this venture.

I will be very active in the development of the commercial version of
Mixmaster.

Let me be crystal clear.
1) I will not support any version of Mixmaster that is weakened.
2) All future clients will be able to generate the current message format.
3) All future servers will be able to read the current message format.
4) There will always be a free version of the client with source code.

While I have not discussed it, I can not imagine that there would not also
be a free version of the server code (with source). Without remailers what
is the point of the client software?
