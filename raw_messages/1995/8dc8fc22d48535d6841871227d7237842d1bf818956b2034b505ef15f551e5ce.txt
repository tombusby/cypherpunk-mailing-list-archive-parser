:-) :-)  And starting a new list lets us decided on a new LOGO to replace
that old tacky rose-and-bits thingy :-)

Cryptographic Professionals for Social Responsibility
Cryptographic Industry Association
National Steganography Alliance
Cryptographers for Foreign Reflexivity
Extremely Private Institute for Cryptography
NII Institute of Cryptography
American Cryptographic Legal Union
Free Banking Institute
Cryptographic Defense Taskforce
Cryptographic Organization for Privacy and Security
Entropy, Steganography, and Cryptography Research Organization for Women

(If anything, what we need is a way to separate the technical/mathematical
discussions from rants like this, but any time we get the list focused
on mostly technical issues, the government goes out of its way to do
something egregiously stupid or offensive...)

Somewhat more seriously, though, there are times that it's useful to have
a more respectable-sounding organization (or at least a letterhead...),
that's open to participation by members and not just directors (which has
been some people's concern about the EFF, CDT, EPIC, and maybe TAP or CPSR.)

If none of those are respectable/accessible/non-socialist enough for you,
and the
British Cryptographic Privacy Association (or whatever their name was)
can't be found or sounds too much like International Outside Agitators,
and the various academic groups are too busy being academicly respectable
to do political agitation ("CryptoAcademics Write Papers!"),
then come up with a name and a Postscript letterhead, and start an
email list that you can gateway to cypherpunks (as long as you can
prevent duplications or mail-floods.)  If the main goal is to have a calmer
name and mostly the same activities, an alter-ego mailing list is one approach.
