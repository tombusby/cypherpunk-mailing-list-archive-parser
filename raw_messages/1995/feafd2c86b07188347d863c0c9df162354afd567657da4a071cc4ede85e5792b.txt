Just a short note to let folks know that I'll be unsubscribing for a while
(probably a couple of months) while I get ready and then move to Amarillo to
set up an ISP :-)

The staging phase is taking up a large portion of my time, and I really
don't have the slack to do more than give the subject lines in the CP list a
cursory glance these days - just enough to see what the current flame war is
about :-)

Once I get the ISP set up, I'll be putting an anon remailer on it; I may
also offer "Remailer-in-a-box" accounts for some relatively minor fee (if
motivated, I may even take digicash as payment :-). I don't expect any
problems about setting up accounts, since I'll be the MIS Manager, VP
Engineering, etc, etc. Too, since the service will be commercial, I expect
that I'll be able to do a pretty fair job of ignoring complaints of the kind
that get .edu and on-the-left remailers shut down.

I'll still be able to receive email at this account at least until the end
of February; once I get set up in Amarillo, I'll resub and let everyone know
where I am (just in case anyone cares :-)

FYI, the tentative name for the ISP is panhandle.net.....
