In some areas they may be a tad more liberal, but in general they
are not.  They do indeed have laws preventing freedom of speech
(especially with regard to right wing politics, the holocaust etc.)
Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that all German ISPs
do not carry various political/controversial newsgroups such as alt.revisionism due to legal reasons.

A more serious problem for those of us in EU countries is that the German government have influence on other EU states - only a week or
two ago they tried to push through European wide legislation
restricting freedom of speech.
