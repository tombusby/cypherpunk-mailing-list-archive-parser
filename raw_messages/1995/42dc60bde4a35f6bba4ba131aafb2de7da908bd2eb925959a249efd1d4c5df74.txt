           Sorry...I was always taught that the user should not
       be mandated to finish the job of the programmer.  Please,
       do not take me wrong, PGP is a remarkable tool...but I
       was not aware I had iron out the bugs.  That part is the
       easiest to do compared with the genius of the program...
       but I still should not have to do it.

This is not "ironing out bugs".  It is configuring the program to run 
on your version of Unix.
