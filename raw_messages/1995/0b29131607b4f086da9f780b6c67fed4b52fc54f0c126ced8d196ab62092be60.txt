There are two of them in my archives: "D. J. Bernstein" 
(djb@silverton.berkeley.edu) at Berkeley who visited the list once; and E.
Bernstein, the author of papers on quantum complexity along with U Vazirani.

I've never heard of either of them tussling with the State Department. Apart
from the name, though, several cryptographer/cypherpunks could fit the bill, 
from Phil Zimmerman of course to various people who've tried to extract ITAR
clearance or FOIA requests.
