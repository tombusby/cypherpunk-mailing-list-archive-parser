O'REILLY RELEASES HANDBOOK ON FIGHTING COMPUTER CRIME

SEBASTOPOL, CA--"Computer Crime: A Crimefighter's Handbook" is a
resource for anyone who needs to know what today's computer crimes look
like, how to prevent them, and how to detect, investigate, and
prosecute them if they do occur.  It contains basic computer security
information as well as extensive guidelines for investigators, law
enforcement, managers, and computer system administrators. The book has
been reviewed by representatives of the U.S. Secret Service, the
Department of Justice, local police departments, district attorney's
offices, and law enforcement abroad.

"Computer Crime" describes the varieties of computer crimes and
profiles the computer criminal, using techniques developed for the FBI
and other law enforcement agencies. It outlines the vulnerabilities of
computer systems and discusses personnel, operational, physical, and
communications measures that can be taken to prevent computer crimes.
In addition, it contains a thorough treatment of effective methods for
investigating and prosecuting computer crimes, ranging from the
supplies needed for criminal investigation, to the detection and audit
tools used in investigation, to the presentation of evidence to a
jury.
