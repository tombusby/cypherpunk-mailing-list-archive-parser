I am about to release Mixmaster 2.0.2

This version will not contain the Socket code, but will have a bunch
of bug fixes. One of the things I am modifying is the posting to news
feature.

Mixmaster supports posting through either a local inews program, or
through a mail-to-news gateway.

There seem to be two flavors of the  latter:
        group.name@gateway.com
and
        mail2news@gateway.com
        Newsgroups: group.name

I really only want to support one of these standards. Which is more standard?
Is there a trend towards one becoming the dominant standard?

The next version should be out within 48 hours.

        -Lance
