XThis is a cleaned-up reposting of the markov3 program.  The following
Xchanges have been made:
X
XThe null pointer dereferencing bugs have been fixed (I hope).
X
XThe code that uses "rand" should now be portable (the patches posted
Xto the net to fix this problem were wrong, they break the code on
Xsome machines in order to fix it on others.  I stole some code from
X"hack" to do things right.  If hack works for you, this should).
X
Xmarkov3 now understands "notes" cruft (thanks to Rich Salz).
X
XBecause of the 50% rule in news 2.11, people often use some other
Xcharacter than ">" for inclusions.  markov3 assumes that lines
Xbeginning with any of 
X
X	> < ) | # } ]
X
Xare inclusions (without this rule, funny-looking output results if
Xanyone uses non-standard "quoting").
X
XThe random number generator is initialized using the time, if neither
Xthe -s flag nor the new -x flag is given.
X
XThis will be the last complete posting; a "patchlevel" file is included
Xand I will send out patches if there are further bugs or improvements.
X
XHere's the original README.
X---------------------------------------------------------------------------
XI created a bit of a stir with this program in December 1986 when I
Xused an earlier version of it to simulate a certain well-known net
Xpersonality (Hi Laura!).  It digests Usenet articles and spits out
Xother articles with similar characteristics.  You need lex to run it,
Xbut otherwise it should run on any Unix I know of.  
X
XI had several requests for the program but didn't consider it
X"ready".  It's as ready as it will ever be now.
X
XThe program uses getopt(3).  There are several public-domain versions
Xavailable for Berkeley systems from the mod.sources archives.  Since
Xit's small, I've included Henry Spencer's version, but you'll have
Xto change the Makefile to use it.
X
XFor best results, feed it at least ten articles by the same person
Xor on the same subject.  If there are fewer articles the output
Xresembles the original too much; if there is too much variety in
Xthe articles the output is more incoherent than it otherwise is.
X
XThe program requires lots of memory if it is given lots of input;
Xthe small-model people will have problems.
X
XPlease don't post the output to the net (though I'd be happy to
Xsee some of the more interesting results).
X
XSend comments, suggestions for improvement, fan mail, and flames
Xto me: {sun,hplabs,ames,ihnp4}!oliveb!epimass!jbuck.

X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.PP
X.I Markov3
Xdigests Usenet articles and builds an internal data structure that
Xmodels the articles as if they came from a random process, where
Xeach word is determined by the previous two.  It then emits a series
Xof articles on the standard output that have the same distribution
Xof words, word pairs, and word triplets as do the input files.
XThe name
X.I markov3
Xcomes from the fact that this structure is called a Markov chain,
Xand that the statistics for word triplets are modeled.
XHere, a "word" is a sequence of printable characters surrounded by
Xwhitespace.  Paragraph breaks (blank lines) are also treated as a
X"word".  Paragraphs of included text are treated as single "words"
Xand printed as "> ...".
X.PP
XBy default, the program expects to be fed Usenet articles; it strips
Xoff headers, included text, and signatures (or at least it tries).
XThe
X.B \-p
X(plain) option disables the header-stripping feature (otherwise
Xeverything is skipped until a blank line is encountered).
X.PP
XBy default, 10 articles, separated by form feeds, are written on the
Xstandard output.  The
X.B \-n
Xoption lets you specify a different number.
X.PP
XThe
X.B \-x
Xoption does not seed the random number generator; this is useful
Xfor simulating people who repeat themselves.
X.PP
XThe
X.B \-d
X(dump) option dumps a representation of the internal data structure
Xbuilt by
X.I markov3
Xon the named file.
X.PP
XFinally, the
X.B \-v
X(verbose)
Xoption prints some statistics on the standard error.
X.SH "CAVEATS"
XThis program allocates lots of memory if given large amounts of input.
XOn virtual memory systems, the paging behavior is atrocious because
Xpointers tend to point every which way, and many pointers are dereferenced
Xfor every word processed.  This could be improved, I'm sure.
X.PP
XPosting articles generated by
X.I markov3
Xto the net may be hazardous to your health.
X.PP
XNot as smart as Mark V. Shaney.
X.SH "PORTABILITY"
XAn effort has been made to make this program as portable as possible;
Xan earlier version was much less portable because of problems with
Xnull pointers and rand(3).  Please let me know if you have further problems.
X.PP
XIf you don't have lex, you'll need to rewrite the lexical analyzer
Xbut most of the program is in C.

X * the header, signature, and included text, together with cruft inserted
X * by rn and notes.  A paragraph of included text is treated like a token.
X *
X * After the table is built (and it can be big), articles are generated
