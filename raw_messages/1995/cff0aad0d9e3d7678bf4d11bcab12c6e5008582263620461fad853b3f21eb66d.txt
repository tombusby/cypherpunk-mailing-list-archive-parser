                       COMPUTER MISUSE DETECTION SYSTEM
                                       
                [CMDS]
                
   Caught in the Act
          Until now, computer misuse could not be detected 
until after
          the damage was done. With CMDS, the system alerts you 
to
          suspicious computer activity as it takes place so you 
can react
          immediately.
          
   Round the Clock Security
          CMDS never sleeps. Computer misuse characteristically 
takes
          place at times when you are not expecting it. If an 
intruder
          rattles your door knob at 2:00 AM, CMDS is there to 
watch the
          shop.
          
   Make the Intruders Think Twice
          Knowing that security software of this type is 
installed will
          give the potential misusers reason to reconsider 
their actions.
          CMDS affects the intruder's motivations by 
threatening them
          with unseen protection. Like police radar, they won't 
know it's
          there until they've been caught!
          
   Security Through Pictures
          If a picture is worth a thousand words and then CMDS 
speaks
          volumes about the security status of your network. 
The security
          trending reports show you, graphically, all the 
information you
          need to identify the intruders.
          
   Off-the-Rack or Tailor Made
          A well made suit off-the-rack can meet the needs of 
most people
          at tremendous cost savings. However, a tailor-made 
suit may be
          necessary when the person in need has special 
requirements.
          SAIC can tailor a system using CMDS core technology 
to meet any
          large heterogeneous network or detection 
requirements.
          
   Increase Efficiency While Reducing Cost, Time Spent, and 
Losses
          CMDS will increase efficiency of your security 
operations by
          performing faster than a manual review process. Your 
security
          staff will be freed up for other activities reducing 
your
          overall cost. Your losses will decrease through the 
deterrence
          and detection capabilities of CMDS.
