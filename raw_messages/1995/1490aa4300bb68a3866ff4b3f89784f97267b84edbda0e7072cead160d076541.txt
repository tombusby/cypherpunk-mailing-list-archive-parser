Well, just to finish the story, I ended up getting the Cincinatti
Microwave Escort 9000 (yes, the radar detector people).  It's 900 MHz
digital spread-spectrum, although it's still unclear how secure their
implementation is.  I'll call them and see what I can come up
with....I realize it's *not* going to give me military-style security.
 But really all I'm interested in is making it simpler (ie cheaper)
for Big Brother to wiretap me than to deal with trying to scan me
without court authorization.
