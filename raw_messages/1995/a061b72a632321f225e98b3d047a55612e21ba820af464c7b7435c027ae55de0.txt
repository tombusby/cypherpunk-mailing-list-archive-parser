Verisign has a range of certificate types; a "Type I", which only
promises that the userid is unique and is otherwise unverified,
is free for non-commercial users and something like $6 for commercial;
Types II and III require various levels of documentation and $$ to get.
The www.verisign.com home page didn't exactly say how to get one;
I gather the answer is "wait for October" or "Use the next Netscape
version", where I'm don't remember if that's 1.2.2 or 2.0.

Netscape is being modified to accept non-Verisign CAs, which means
we _can_ build a web of trust to take advantage of it, using
X.509 certs or a hybrid of X.509 and PGP.
