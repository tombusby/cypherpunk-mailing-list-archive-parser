Hot news at DigiCash.  One, a real live bank is going to be issuing
Ecash denominated in U.S. dollars.  See "http://www.digicash.com/" and
"http://www.marktwain.com/".


Two, the one million trial cyberbucks have been issued and no more 
will be issued, although the First Digital Bank will continue to 
run the trial for now.  In honor of the occasion I hereby offer


E=100 US=$8.00 SELL-OFFER "Sun Oct 22 19:34:28 MDT 1995" 2 bryce@colorado.edu


Pretty soon we'll be able to exchange First Digital Bank trial 
cyberbucks for Mark Twain Bank cyberbucks denominated in U.S. Dollars.
I wonder if our trial cyberbucks will be considered collector's items?
I know that I will always be proud of *mine*...
