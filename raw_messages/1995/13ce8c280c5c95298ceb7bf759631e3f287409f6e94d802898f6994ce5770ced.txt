The problem with the Interceptor is that I think it can only receive one
freqency at a time, and it is adjustable by a thumb wheel, not digitally.
This would tend to make changing frequencies at high rates VERY hard. :)
Also it has no frequancy readout, so this means that if you know what freq.
you should be at it is hard to tune in that freq. without searching a little.
