     This is what I think about setting up an additional list:
     
     1. If I subscribe to both lists, it won't change my eMail traffic
     
     2. If the "news, NOISE, off-topic" posts are sent to both lists, my 
     eMail volume will increase
     
     3. The cypherpunks subscribers are not the problem
     
     4. What Adam and Perry (and others) want is that the "news, NOISE, 
     off-topic" posters change their behavior and not post long news items 
     verbatim.
     
     5. How are you going to get those posters to agree to change?
     
     My vote, for what it's worth, is don't split the list.  It won't work 
     because the extra posts ARE going to go to this list because that's 
     where they believe their readers are.
