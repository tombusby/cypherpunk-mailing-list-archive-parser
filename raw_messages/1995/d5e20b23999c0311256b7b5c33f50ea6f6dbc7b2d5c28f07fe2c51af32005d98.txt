   "Telecommunications Giants Join Internet Security Quest."

      The consortium seeks to establish a layer of software
      and hardware standards that would effectively rest atop
      the Internet. Their goal is to make the Internet more
      secure, reliable and easy to use. The consortium started
      meeting last summer, and had seven core members: AT&T,
      Deutsche Telekom, Lotus, Novell, NTT, the Telstra
      Corporation and Unisource. The group held private 
      meetings from Dec. 6 through Dec. 9 in New York, 
      attended by 24 phone carriers and 14 computer companies, 
      including Intel, Microsoft, Sun and the Hewlett-Packard. 


   "The prospect of Internet censorship raises troubling
   issues for business." Denise Caruso's column.

      While most of the outcry has raised valid concerns about
      the First Amendment and civil liberties, little of the
      discussion has focused on how censorship could cripple
      much of the Internet's commercial potential. "This
      proposal will have more than a chilling effect," Ms.
      Fulton said. "It may well mean a cold death for everyone
      except very rich and very cautious media companies."
