  First off, Sternlight is not an agent working for netscape.  :-)

  The same fix that will be going out to patch old versions will be applied

as necessary before the final release of 2.0.

  Agreed.  See other messages of mine for a more detailed response.

  Again, see my other messages on this and related topics for more details
of what the code was doing on PC and Mac.

  Yup.  Then I can get back to working only 16 hours a day.  :-)
