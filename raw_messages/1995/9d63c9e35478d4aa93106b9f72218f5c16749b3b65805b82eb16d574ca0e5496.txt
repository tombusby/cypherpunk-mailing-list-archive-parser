        Eudora can tell whether you've read a message or not by reading the
'status' line of a message. The status line contains an "R" if the message
has been previously read. Eudora uses POP 3 I believe. Elm also uses the
'status' line. The upshot of this is that you can configure Eudora to leave
your mail on the server and next time Eudora goes to read your mail, it
ignores all previously read messages and only downloads the new ones.

        This may or may not be a part of the RFC's (I haven't read them)
but this is the way I've always seen it work. So there's no reason that
Netscape couldn't do the same if it can't already. I can't tell yet whether
it's capable or not as I'm still down loading version 2.0b as I type. :-)

Cheers,
