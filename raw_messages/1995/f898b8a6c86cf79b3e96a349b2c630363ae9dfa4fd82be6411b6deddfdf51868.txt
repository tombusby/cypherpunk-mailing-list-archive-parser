IMPORTANT NOTE:

If you are going to use the IDEA 68k assembler distributed with Secure Edit
b0.5, please take note of the following bug:

You have to change

@Mulzero3:
        neg.w   d7 <---
        addq.w  #1,d5
        sub.w   -2(a1),d5
        bra.s   @Muldone3

to:

@Mulzero3:
        neg.w   d5 <---
        addq.w  #1,d5
        sub.w   -2(a1),d5
        bra.s   @Muldone3


I have not yet received any reports of data being fouled up by this, and
before tonight personally had encrypted and decrypted megabytes without
error, but note that I HAVE FOUND EXAMPLES OF IT FOULING UP A BLOCK OF
DATA. IT IS DANGEROUS TO USE THIS CODE IN ITS PRESENT FORM. Please make
note of this if you are going to use this 68k code.

Currently, I do not believe this code is being used anywhere except Secure
Edit b0.5, although it was certainly about to be used. I will immediately
upload a corrected version of Secure Edit and source.

Sorry about the screw up.

Tom
