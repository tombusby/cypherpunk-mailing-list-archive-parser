I don't know what can be done here other then encuraging the user
to use a long password.

Don't I need to know what goes into the IV?  I can't just stick
random stuff in it - I need to stick something that is a function
of the passphrase into it (or make the user remember something
my program spits out).

Oh, I was going to do a MD5 of half of the passphrase to get one
key pair, then MD5 the other half to get another key, and that
left about 64 bits to play with....

Don't I need to reproduce the same IV during the decryption?

Hmmmm, so I should put the salt in the clear at the start of the file?
This looks like an intresting idea.

(it occurs to me that I never mentioned what my "sample application"
was - I was thinking of encryption backup tapes so they can safely
be transported off site and stored.)
