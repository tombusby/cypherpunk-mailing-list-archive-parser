Apart from what Russ Nelson observed, safety in numbers is potentially great.
If, say, 15% of the net.populace does it, then it won't be terribly
interesting to know that some particular person has done it. I suppose a
transition period would be helpful, in which credit card-financed bandwidth
is increased with a load of low security traffic.
