And recalling Matt Blaze's hilarious tale of trying to get the right forms
filled out and approved at an airport prior to departure for Europe, one
has to wonder what confused looks would be gotten were someone to try to
get a "Commodity Jurisdiction Request" (or whatever is needed) to export
one's thoughts....

"Yes, I'm trying to find out what forms I need to fill out to export the
cryptography knowledge that's now in my head."

"Huh?"

"Well, I understand that it's illegal for me to think crypto thoughts in
Anguilla, where I'm going on vacation. So, to protect me in the event I
talk in my sleep, and a foreign national hears me, I want to register with
your office."

"Huh?"
