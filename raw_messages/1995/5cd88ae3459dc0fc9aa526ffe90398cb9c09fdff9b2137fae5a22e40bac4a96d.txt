while i wouldn't be at liberty to get you a valid code, (i'm not sure
of the number of digits it wants as i haven't gotten mine yet), i
would suggest you call one of mci's customer service centers and
_politely_ request that they allow access to this service to non-mci
employees. i would suggest that they put some kind of message on the
number before they give you the ani like "this service provided by
mci." i would see this as a good public relations tactic for the
company for telecom-type folx who would be using it.

my 2 cents.

unfortunately, i don't speak for my company.
