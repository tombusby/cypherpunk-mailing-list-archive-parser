For your personal situation you *must* get competent legal advice.  
I.E. pay someone who makes it a point to stay more current in this stuff 
than I do.  I recommend Lee Tien, for example, or Ken Bass.  I bet Lee is 
less expensive :>.  This note is NOT legal advice, and may not be 
competent since it is research-free.  It would not be wise to make any 
important decisions on the basis of this note.

As a general matter, however, if you are a US person and give crypto to a 
foreign person (be it a real person or a corporation), then as a 
technical legal matter you are in violation of the ITAR. 

US law doesn't ordinarily cover non-us corporations abroad (but see some
anti-trust and money laundering rules), but the ITAR will cover any US
person (ie citizen or green card holder) who works for them or transacts
with them. 

Off the top of my head, I don't know whether the acquisition of totally
foreign-created crypto by a foreign corporation managed, owned or
controlled by a US person becomes an ITAR-controlled "export" when that 
crypto is sold to a non-us person.  I would, however, want a good legal 
opinion before I exposed myself to the risk as I could sure make a good 
argument that the ITAR reached that far.  All of this is without 
prejudice to the issue of whether the ITAR are constitutional...

As for the specific fact situation you describe below, which I understand
to be a little different from the one described above, I'm afraid you
would have to discuss this in some detail with a lawyer; I'm sorry I can't
be more help.
