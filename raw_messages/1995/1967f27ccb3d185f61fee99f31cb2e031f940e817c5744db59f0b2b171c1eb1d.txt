More importantly for covert channel analysis, do they have access to good
clocks?  Access to a good clock could make a Java applet a good candidate
for the receiver in a generalized covert channel attack.  Access to both
process time and real-world time can give a good indication of load on the
processor, and might be needed for animation.  A transmitter could send by
using or not using the CPU.  (Installing the transmitter is left as an
excersize for the student. ;-) )
