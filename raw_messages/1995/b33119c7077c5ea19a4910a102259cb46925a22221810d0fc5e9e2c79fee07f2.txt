Read the SKIP spec (SKIP is Sun's IP level encryption protocol).  It uses
Diffle-Hellman certificates.  That means fixed secret DH keys being used
in routers.  It is hard to thing of a better target for this type of
attack.  I have not done a complete read of the SKIP specification (only a
quick scan) so I could be wrong about SKIP but DH certificates sound like
a very very bad idea.  The other source for attack would be any networked
service that is on a local network.  Single user machines are far better
targes than multi-user systems.  That Web server sitting idle not doing
much, repeatedly hit it with https requests and if you are on a local
network, you should be able to get very good timing information. 

I for one will probably add a flag for conditional compilation of my 
bignumber library so that it will take constant time.  This may be a %10 
slow down (using small windows exponentiation) which is trivial compared 
to the %30 speedup I will probably get when I implement a faster mod 
function :-).
