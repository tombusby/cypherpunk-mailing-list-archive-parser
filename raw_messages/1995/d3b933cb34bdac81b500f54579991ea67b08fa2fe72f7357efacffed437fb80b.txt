If the server can keep track of drop games and the restart it should not
be diffucult to keep a record for each player of how many games he
has dropped and not restarted. A high number would mean a cheater
or someone with a very bad phone line. In either case you dont want to play
with them.

For the second problem there is no easy solution. One thing to make it more
anoying for the cheater is to keep a history of matches played by each
players. A player that has played 50 matches with anotherone an won all
is either cheating or not looking for a challange. Of curse the cheater
just has to create a new nym each time to play agains in this case.
Bottom line is that on the net a nym can be multiple persons and a person
can have multiple nyms.
