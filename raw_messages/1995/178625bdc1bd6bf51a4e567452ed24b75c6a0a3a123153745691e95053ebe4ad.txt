the most reasonable and easiest to implement solution to eliminating the
need for west's page number system is to just number each paragraph.
anyone can do this.

Hmm, 
how hard could it be to eliminate West page numbers?

There couldn't be more than a couple of cases on each page, 
if each page number were replaced by links to each case, a
lawyer could tell on the first glance which of the three was
right and mark it, assuming a reasonable HTML/SGML editor or
something.  Seems like it could be done as a part of daily work
and the results accreted somewhere.
