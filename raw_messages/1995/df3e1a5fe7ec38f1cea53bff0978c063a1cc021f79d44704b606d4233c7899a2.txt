The process of spending a coin is not simply that of transfering data.
There is a complicated protocol in which Alice decrypts some of the
identity information in the coin.  Let's say that Alice spends the coin
twice, once with Bob and again with Chuck.  Bob and Chuck can pool the
information they got from Alice and reconstruct her identity.  Alice
can't just give them both the same information because the receiver is
the one who determines what information is decrypted.  For a more
detailed explanation, check out Schneier's book.
