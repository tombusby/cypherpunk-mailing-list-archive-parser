Here's the problem:  "Clipper" ALREADY isn't "voluntary," because the public
has already been forced to pay for its development via  stolen tax dollars.
At least hypothetically, the government could misuse its discretion even
further to push a Clipper-like solution, in order to skew the market against
the adoption of good encryption.  Follow me so far?  They could go as far as
to subsidize Clipper-installed telephones, making them cost &50 at your
local discount store, competitive with non-crypto phones. 

Okay, I presume that the  company that makes Clipper chips (VLSI Technology)
must ultimately sell them, UNPROGRAMMED, to manufacturers who are to build
those  telephones.  I see a business opportunity to act as a VOLUNTARY
escrow agent, but one that only agrees to keep the keys for the chips for
"30 feet or 30 seconds."  In other words, build (or modify) Clipper-type
telephones with chips that are ostensibly escrowed, but due to the agreement
with the end user the keys will be erased.  (Or, the keys will be kept
encrypted, unbreakably, with the "key to the key" given to the end user, who
will presumably burn it on receipt.)

What I _DON'T_ want to see happen is for the USG to be able to refuse
escrow-agent status to an organization which is actively hostile to the
concept of key escrow, an organization  which is willing to work with
end-users to thwart the USG's access  to products which (due to the fact
they were never exported) do not fall under any ITAR-type regulations.
