Yes, this is true.  Even if it didn't crash the system, however, it could
have the effect of disabling mail service, either to all users on the system
or to the particular user being spammed (depending on the robustness of the
system).  Though it's not as likely to anger the sysadmin, it is more likely
to anger the spamee.  More to the point, if the spammer uses random
anonymous remailers to protect his/her identity, there's no good way to
prevent this attack short of installing a filter of some kind or refusing
mail from remailers.  If no one will accept mail from the anon remailers,
what good are they?

I though most usage agreements had something in them about reasonable limits
and such.  On that basis, a provider could choose to auto-kill spam if they
thought it "unreasonable".  This of course assumes that providers always
abide by well-defined rules and are not arbitrary in any way. :-)

It's been my experience up to this point that for each security safeguard
put in place, there will be someone somewhere that will find a way to breach
it.  Perhaps strong crypto will serve to end that trend; I doubt it, though,
due to the horrid legal situation.  Thus I doubt that written,
human-enforced policy will disappear anytime soon.  Not an ideal situation,
I must admit.
