Well. I think if killing the Weaver clan was the primary objective, they
could have been much more direct. One plane, one bomb/missile, one pilot,
with a 1:7 force ratio (1:2 if you don't count probable noncombatants). Or
a SEAL team with tools to make it look like an "accident" (carbon
monoxide, maybe? A propane explosion?). However, we generally frown on
that kind of thing in our polite society. :-)

If the Feds had really wanted to kill the Weavers, it'd probably be called
"Ruby Crater" now.

Murphy's Law applies everywhere. Most likely they really wanted to take
Weaver and clan alive (and thought they could!), and the worst possible
things happened. (Surprisingly enough, government TLAs know all about the
concept of "bad press," and killing bystanders isn't SOP.)

But they don't have to face you directly, just convince someone who
allegedly represents you that a "law" is necessary to "save you from
yourself" and to "keep our great country free and safe." Then you either
play ball, or you wind up with a bunch of balaclava-clad guys in your
bedroom one night, taking your computer and dragging you off. Maybe they 
don't get anything to convict you, but you still have to mount a costly 
defense.

What a great system, eh? Just like the Founding Fathers imagined.
