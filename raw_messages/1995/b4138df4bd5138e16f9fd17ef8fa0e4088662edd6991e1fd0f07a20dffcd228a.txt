But it would also have to hide in something you load at boot time.  For 
it to propogate there, it would have to make copies of itself. when crond 
and inetd and named all grow over 400K I get curious.  Dos has small 
usage, and Linux provides a link map (or I can checksum entry points or 
such).  Another fun thing to do is pkexe or gzexe.  The latter turns an 
exe into a shell script.  Patching compressed files is very difficult.
