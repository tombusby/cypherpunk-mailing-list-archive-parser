  The printed digits above the embossed account number are the first four
  digits of the BIN (on Visa cards) or ICA (on MasterCards). They are there
  to discourage re-embossing of the card with another account number.

True for Visa cards, but false for the AMEX. On my
two Amex cards there is no obvious relationship
between the four digit number and the embossed
card number.

Greg.
