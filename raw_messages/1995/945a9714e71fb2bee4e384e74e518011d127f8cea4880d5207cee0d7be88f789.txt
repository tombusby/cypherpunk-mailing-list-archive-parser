Could someone point me to Brand's electronic money protocol?  I have heard of
it and would like to learn more.  If it is a discussable topic then please
someone try to convince me that it is better than Chaum's or
Chaum's-plus-anonymity-both-ways, or some other candidate for E-Money
Protocol Which Has Official Cypherpunk Blessing.


(Hopefully a discussion will ensue and rescue this article from that room in
Data Hell where posts that ask for help but contribute nothing are sent...)
