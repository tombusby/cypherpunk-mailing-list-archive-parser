My take on the paper is that he first presents the "mix", or remailer, as
a method of foiling traffic analysis.  Then he extends this to the
"cascade", or chain of remailers, which does not improve traffic analysis
resistence but as you say provides some immunity against a bad operator.

There are other differences which may be relevant in practice.  One is
bandwidth.  With a Chaumian cascade of N remailers you get N times the
bandwidth used, as well as increased latency through the remailer
network.

One thing that is not often appreciated in Chaum's paper is that at least
in his first description of the cascade, the assumption is that all users
use the same sequence of remailers in the same order.  We OTOH usually assume
a different model, where the different possible paths are chosen with
some distribution and randomness.  I posted an analysis of some of the
impacts of this difference a few months ago.
