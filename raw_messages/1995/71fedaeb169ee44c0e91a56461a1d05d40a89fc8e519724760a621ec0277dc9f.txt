punk.net is in San Luis Obispo. Since Skypoint carries a lot of 
regional groups, I can follow the issue on Usenet, in these
groups:

slo.unix,slo.general,slo.punks,alt.comp.acad-freedom.talk,comp
.org.eff.talk

Those of you who don't get the slo.* groups, you can probably see
the original posts in comp.org.eff.talk or alt.comp.acad-freedom.

The subject is "No subject".

(I still chuckle when I see the group slo.sex ...)
