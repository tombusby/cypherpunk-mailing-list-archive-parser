> San Francisco, Sept. 7 -- The Intel Corporation said

> 
> The machine, to be built at an estimated cost of $45
> million, would use 9,000 of Intel's forthcoming P6
> microprocessors linked in a configuration known as
> massively parallel. In recent years, massively parallel
> computers using thousands of relatively inexpensive
> off-the-shelf chips have stolen the performance lead from
> traditional supercomputers like those made famous by Cray
> Research Inc., which use far fewer, but far more powerful
> processors.

> Intel said its new supercomputer would be the first to
> achieve the goal of calculating more than a trillion
> floating-point operations a second, known as a teraflop.
> The machine, to be kept at Sandia National Laboratories
> In Albuquerque, N.M., would be used by Department of
> Energy scientists to study a variety of complex problems,
> foremost among them nuclear weapons safety.

> deterrent. We are embarking on a 10-year program to
> advance the state of high performance computing to meet
