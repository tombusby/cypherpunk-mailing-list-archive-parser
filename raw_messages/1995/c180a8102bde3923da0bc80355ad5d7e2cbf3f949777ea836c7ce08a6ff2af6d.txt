>Conference Summary
>-------------------------
>As the fastest growing facet of the Internet and other component
>technologies, electronic commerce offers functionality and new
>ways of doing business that no company can afford to ignore. The
>basis for moving to an electronic commerce is a belief that electronic
>markets have the potential to be more efficient in developing new
>information-based goods and services, finding global customers and
>trading partners to conduct business. Electronic commerce via the
>Internet or the next generation network infrastructure -- Information
>Superhighway -- will change business institutions, operations and
>products/services as we know today, just as the telephone, TV, fax,
>e-mail and EDI changed the way businesses and consumers
>communicate.
>
>This conference is aimed at pushing and provoking electronic
>commerce research and practice to "go where no firm has ever
>ventured before." We expect electronic commerce to obsolete much
>of the accumulated research in business. Instead of merely
>transforming the way commerce is done today from a non-electronic
>world to an electronic platform, the new way of commerce will
>create and demand radical changes in the process, product and
>promotion to better exploit the digital platform.
>
>It is no longer sufficient for electronic commerce to be viewed as a
>path- breaking technology. Electronic commerce is already playing
>an significant role in determining the strategy of today's companies
>in providing value to external and internal customers. The challenge
>facing companies is to increase the effectiveness of electronic
>commerce activities in order to achieve superior business
>performance. As successful organizations have taken a process-
>oriented view of their businesses, they will have to re- evaluate the
>role of the electronic commerce in terms of alignment with corporate
>goals.
>
>Expanded roles for electronic commerce within the business include
>activities which support other internal business processes. Questions
>such as how this activity should be carried out, how electronic
>commerce should be integrated with other organizational units, and
>how electronic commerce technology can facilitate the goals of the
>organization turn out to be complex decisions for executives making
>these investments.
>
>Likewise, electronic commerce can become a key liaison to
>customers. These electronic commerce based organizations are
>increasingly taking on activities which expand the service offerings
>of the company. An new breed of expertise -- electronic commerce
>specialists -- is bound to emerge that focuses on creating increased
>satisfaction and stronger relationships with customers.
>
>However, this emerging electronic marketplace is an unknown and
>much like the "Wild West" of the past needs to be tamed. The
>challenge is simple: using emerging technology how do we create a
>business environment or infrastructure that will ensure efficient
>electronic markets? What does it take in terms of new organization
>structures like the network structures facilitated by smart and
>wireless messaging; new electronic institutions such as brokerages
>staffed by electronic brokers or agents; new business processes
>better suited for mass customization, global sourcing and logistics;
>new financial payment mechanisms and mercantile protocols?
>
>To achieve exploration and exploitation of new frontiers, we need to
>integrate business concerns with the changing technology. This
>conference aims at providing this integration by bringing together
>leading business researchers who specialize in the various facets of
>electronic markets, namely economics, finance, marketing
>production and operations management, and technology experts in
>the industry who are creating the electronic commerce infrastructure.
>In addition, we are inviting experts who specialize in the WWW
>browsers, electronic cash, encryption, software agents, MIME-
>based messaging, EDI and structured documents.
>
>In sum, investments in electronic commerce, whether in time or
>money, typically introduce far-reaching organizational and
>technological issues. The outcome of this conference will be a better
>understanding of the shape, structure, and operation of business in
>the coming millennium.
>
>We hope you are able to attend this conference. Registration
>information and materials are enclosed.
