That is about right. Inside the armor is a bunch of binary data. 20 header
blocks, and the message block. The first message block is a PGP encrypted
to the remailer, and contains the next destination. The other 19 headers,
and the message block are IDEA encrypted with a key and IV in the first
header. When decrypted, the second header is seen to be PGP encrypted to
the next remailer, and the rest is encrypted with the key in that header.
The remailer Shifts up all the headers, sticks junk in the 20th header, and
rearmors the whole thing.

This is rather more active manipulation than the current remailers.

I realize that. It was easy to implement, since I already had to check for
:: to be compatible with type 1 messages.

I agree that changing mixmaster to search for a MIME line, rather than the
:: would be no effort at all.

I use sendmail for the client and the remailer (actually they are the same
code), so adding new headers is easy. Unfortunately I am having some
problems with sendmail. Sendmail is marking the messages as "Apperently
To:" rather than "To:". Any idea what might cause that?

I am not sure I want to give up the CRC on the armor (esp. since I am using
the PGP tools routines and not my own), but I would be interested in
defining a new MIME content type. So, experts, what all is involved in
that, and is there any problem with starting to use a MIME type before it
is official?
