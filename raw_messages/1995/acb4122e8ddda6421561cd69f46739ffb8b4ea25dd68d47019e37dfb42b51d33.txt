Mmm, didn't you just cut it in half (assuming simultaneous receive/transmit),
saving about 10^3 time ?  (I can't get through to the archives at the moment.)
Anyway, it's a nice improvement to the protocol.

I guess we should once again wish Roger Schlafly the best of luck in his
ongoing litigation. 

While we're on the subject, I've just noticed an interesting protocol in
Schneier, "invented by Shamir but never published", for communication over
an insecure channel without a shared secret ["Shamir's Three Pass Protocol" in
v.1,Sec.16.1,pp.376-377]. This protocol seems to have very appealing 
features, so I'm a little surprised that only the initial reference is given 
in Schneier. Using Shamir's proposed commutative symmetric cipher with it,
I suppose it's probably slower than DH for key exchange, and progress on the
discrete log problem would affect it just as much as RSA. Anyone have other
references offhand, or know any other reasons this protocol isn't so useful ?
