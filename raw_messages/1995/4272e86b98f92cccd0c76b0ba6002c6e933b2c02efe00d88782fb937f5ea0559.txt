I would assume since they are using a key size >40 bit, it is used for
authentication only, not for data encrytion, that would skirt the ITAR
regs.  If fact according to the docs, there is no data encryption when
connecting to an international version server, regardless of the
client version.

I would assume that a >512 bit key in V4 would allow upwards of 1024
or better.  That should be sufficient for now.

My understanding was that the problems exposed with RC4 that you
mentioned, were with the particular implemenation by Netscape.  I
guess I better go back to the archive and do some reading. :-)

Thanks, for the info.
