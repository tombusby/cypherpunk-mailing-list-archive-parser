I think that this is a quite good idea with one caveat.  That we use a 
good random algorithm.  As people on this list are quite aware, many
algorithms that ship in libraries of commercial OSs are flawed in one
way or another.

Perhaps a combination of the two: give the whole list rotated in a
round-robin fashion, and let the client do with it as they will.  There
are enough coders on this list that we'll soon see independently 
developed versions of the client software, (although a published 
protocol for talking with the slaves would be nice), and some might
like to draw the first from the list, another randomly choose one,
etc...
