Perhaps that's 1154 wiretap victims, with an average of 20 intercepts each?

In a separate article, Clark posted estimates that ranged from
500K - 1.5M people could be wiretapped, depending on how many people
are in the 1%/.5%/.25% zones.  It's worse than that - if they're tapping
the average victim for (say) 3 months, that's 4 times as many victims....
And just how many cops do they plan to hire to watch all these phones?
Computers can help some, especially for data, but who's going to read it all,
even after the fancy pattern recognition systems pick out the possible good
stuff.
