-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The anonymous FTP server running on net-dist.mit.edu (which is also
bitsy.mit.edu) is currently down due to a failure of the disk drive
that hosts the files. We expect to replace the disk this afternoon
(Saturday) and begin restoral operational as soon as the new disk
is cabled up.

We apologize for the inconvenience and hope to have full service
restored shortly.
