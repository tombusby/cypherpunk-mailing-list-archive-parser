Huh?  Are you sure you're not thinking of 2DES?

2DES is known to be not much more secure than DES: 2DES can be broken
with 2^56 operations and 2^56 space.  (The space requirements can be
eliminated without too much extra cost in time.)

Could you post a reference for your claim that 2-key 3DES is insecure?
Or post an attack?  Or anything?
