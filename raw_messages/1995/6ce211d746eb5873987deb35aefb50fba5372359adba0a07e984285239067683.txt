		       Valentines & Hearts Party!
		         	   @
		             Bryant's Bend	
		

	Our wonderful house at Bryant's Bend in Palo Alto, is having 
it's annual Valentines Party on Valentines Day and we would love to have 
you join us in the celebrations. 

	We request that everyone who attends cum dressed in women's lingerie 
for this feastive occasion. Anyone showing up at the door "overdressed" 
will not be given entry to this event. I suggest visiting Victoria's Secret
as they are having sales on their silky lingerie... :)

	I realize the notice is short but hope you can make it
				anyways...  :)  


	When:   Tuesday Night (yes, that's this week)
	                  ((Feb 14, 1995))
	Time:   7:30 to late
	Where:	130 Bryant St.
		Palo Alto CA

	What to bring:  Yourselves, any veggie food items you enjoy
               (we're a veggie co-op :) and any drinks. We will
		be providing the atmosphere and some non-alcoholic 
		drinks and small munchies.... Drums and instruments
		are most welcome as well as games... 
		
	Activities for the evening:
		Be prepared to play "Spin the Heart" and "Truth or Dare"
		while you are there. We will also have dancing upstairs and 
		kissing in the famous "Kissin Corner"! So watch where 
		you walk... 


	Directions to this Awesome Party:

	From Highway 101 (North or south):  
	
		Take the University Exit that heads West. Follow
		University Street until you reach Bryant St.
		Make a right onto Bryant St. and follow it to the 
		end. We are the last house on the left hand side
		and are on the corner of Bryant St. and Palo Alto
		Way. It's a big tan house with brown trimmings.
	

Hope to see you there...
