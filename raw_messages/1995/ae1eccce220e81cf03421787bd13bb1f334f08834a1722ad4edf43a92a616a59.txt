   What I am getting from you is "worry." This does not convince me. I
want solid technical criticism. Sorry for being so harsh, but that's how I
feel. 

   In fact, I propose that the security of the "slave process" model is
_better_ than the realistic alternatives. Without it, the application
stuff (for example, displaying pretty MIME content) and the crypto stuff
must share an address space. A bug in the application stuff could corrupt
or compromise the crypto data structures. As we have seen demonstrated
several times, it is just not practical to build large, complex
applications which are worthy of the highest level of trust. Factoring it 
into two processes helps.

   Tokens are nice, but I think there's a lot to be said for software 
solutions as well. At the very least, I don't consider the existence of 
tokens to be an argument that software crypto systems shouldn't be built.

   I would accept SHA as a reasonable alternative.

   Using the modulus alone is not good enough. A bogus key with the same 
modulus and a different exponent could be used to mount a 
denial-of-service attack. Note that the PGP 2.6.2 key fingerprint scheme 
suffers from a similar problem; since the sizes of the modulus and 
exponent fields are not included in the hash, it is possible to generate 
bogus keys with the same fingerprint. Specifying the key size and 
fingerprint together is, however, unforgeable.

I looked at the MOSS representation of the key (I'm talking PK's here
only, not all the X.509 stuff). I don't think it would be that hard to
code.

   I was referring to the interface that PGP presents to the outside 
world, not its internal keyring structures. These issues come up whenever 
using PGP from the command line, or trying to interface it with other 
applications.

   I understand that Matt Blaze's forthcoming "Policymaker" will do all 
this and more.

   This is fine, but it's one more thing to manually maintain. How is the 
user going to verify that the alias is really right? This is another 
place where a 32- (or 40-) hex digit unique name would come in handy.

   I agree that a moderated list would be better, but I do not have the
time do it myself.
   One suggestion that I think is very good is to moderate on the basis 
on the basis of sender, rather than message. The best way to do this 
would be to keep a keyring of "approved" senders, and match the signature 
of each message against the keyring. As I say, I'm not volunteering, but 
if somebody else was so moved, I think it would be a valuable service.
