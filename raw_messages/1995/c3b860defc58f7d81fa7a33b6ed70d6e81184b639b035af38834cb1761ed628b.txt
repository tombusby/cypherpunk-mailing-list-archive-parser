It's an artificial example, but one that points out that merely doing a 
frequency analysis on the datastream isn't enough to guantee the correct 
answer.  Reliable remailer software will have to worry about false postives 
as well as false negatives; especially if it's a fee-for-service operation.

This might also be a nice feature if you're trying to dodge an NSA filter.

Of course the implicit assumption in that statement is that encrypted 
traffic hasn't been outlawed or regulated, or that the sender doesn't want 
to 'appear' to be sending encrypted traffic.
