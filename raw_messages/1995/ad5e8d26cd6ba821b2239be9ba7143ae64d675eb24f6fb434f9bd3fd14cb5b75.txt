Their consultant, Prof. Dorothy Demming(sp?), has been asked this very
question about PGP, and she deftly avoided comment on both PGP and IDEA.
[I believe this was on NPR, but I'm not certain.] The emergence of NSA
from absolutely secret agency to semi-public status (writing letters,
P.R. concerns, opening a museum, etc.) at the same time as the general 
availability of what's considered by many [including me] to be strong, 
free, cryptography "for the masses" is interpreted by many [including me]
as an implicit NSA comment on the availability of strong crypto in 
general, and on the availability of PGP in particular.
