Well, a few years ago I partially satisfied my phone-phreaking habit in
the following manner:
I would walk up to a busy intersection in a comercial area and stroll
through the various gas stations located there, collecting receipts
that careless customers had forgotten to take with them after using the
"pay-at-the-pump".  Then I would visit the pay phones at the nearby
mini-malls.  It sure didn't cost me a dollar a number.

The cost/value of a card number depends a lot on what you seek to gain.
If it's free phone calls, your costs are basically nil.  If you want
free gas, it'll cost you $500 or so for the card reader/writer and a
few old cards.  If you have a system for extracting thousands of dollars
from each card, economics of scale would probably justify the $10000
rc4-breaker.  ...or you could just hack netcom, steal the mother lode
and be set for life...  (Hi Kevin!  drop me a line when you get out;
ya gotta love those plea-bargains - 30 year sentence reduced to 8
months! ;-)
