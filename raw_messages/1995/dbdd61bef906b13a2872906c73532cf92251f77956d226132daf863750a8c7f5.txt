Charlie Kaufmann goes into moderate detail on Lotus Note's 
encryption scheme in "Network Security: Private communication
in an public world"

Each user has both strong (~512 bit)  and weak (~400 bit)  RSA keys. 
These, and strong (64 bit) or weak (40 bit) symmetrical session keys 
are used depending on the  location of the users.
