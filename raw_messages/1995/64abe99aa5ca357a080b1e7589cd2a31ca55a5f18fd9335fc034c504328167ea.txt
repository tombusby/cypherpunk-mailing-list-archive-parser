The problem for THIS member of an opposition party is that the
percentage of the U.S. budget comprising "Black" (secret, "off
the books" usually mil./intelligence) programs grows yearly,
like inflation. At the same time, the speed of chips increases
like the national debt and their cost goes down steadily, (see
Robert Hettinga's post titled, "e$: The Book-Entry/Certificate
Distinction" describing Moore's law). These trends, (IMO) bode
ill for my long-term personal (and political!) privacy, unless
the freedom of those of you able to "write code"(tm) implement-
ing my privacy is unfettered. Anything that reacts as slowly to
the marketplace as the government does will constantly be play-
ing catch-up. Others may disagree, depending on your individual
level of trust in the present government.

On a different, and sad, note...Phil Zimmermann's mom recently
passed away. I encourage all of you to make a donation in her
name to his legal defense fund, and (if religious) to include
her in your prayers.
Peace.
JMR

"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its
own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he
contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous
structures of reality. It is enough if one merely tries to comprehend
a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity."
