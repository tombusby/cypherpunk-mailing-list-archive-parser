Accessdata of Orem Utah (1-800-658-5199) sells cracks for many of them.
So does John Kuslich (602-863-9274); I think his prices are lower.
I don't personally known or endorse either of 'em.

I append a message with some code for doing 4.0 -- I haven't tried it, and
don't know if it works for 5.0.  It's in Basic, but I didn't perpetrate it.

You may find the following program of help. I am sorry it's in QBasic but that's the
only free language I have at present. The program removes document protection from
Excel worksheets. I haven't tested it extensively so there are no guarantees or warranties.
Always keep a backup copy of your files etc...

The protection scheme does two things:

 1. When you protect your document, Excel hashes your password to a 16 bit value, stores
    it somewhere and sets a few flags to say that the document is protected.

 2. When Excel saves a protected document it encrypts the content of each block using 16
    different alphabetic substitutions. This allows Excel to read and display protected
    documents before knowing their password. The program below unscrambles a protected
    document, removes an extra 8 byte block at the beginning, and resets the flags and
    passwords to zero.

I don't know if it can cope with all combinations of protection available in Excel. It
works fine on the simple protect document option. Similarly, charts etc. will probably
get munged since I don't think the titles etc get scrambled.

Hope this stuff is of use to someone.       Alan.

PS. Ironically enough, I found Excel of great value in recovering the set of magic numbers
used in the program. It allowed me to very quickly generate and evaluate possible decryption
formulae!
