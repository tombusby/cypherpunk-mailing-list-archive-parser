Interesting. At the NIST meeting, criteria #5 deals with decrypting
a conversation with only the key from one end.

I thought that would be hard to implement. But during the discussion,
they called on Miles Smid [sp?] who was obviously a NIST employee/consultant
with real knowledge. He suggested that you could encrypt the
session key with the public key of both parties, and send it along.
This would allow single ended GAK.

This is not far from the idea that CME proposed that the NSA/FBI/CIA
publish public keys, and we'll hack a voluntary version of PGP that
encrypts the session key with the LEA public key -- instant
voluntary Key Escrow.

Miles Smid's idea seemed reasonable, until you realize that he intends
you to escrow your private key...
