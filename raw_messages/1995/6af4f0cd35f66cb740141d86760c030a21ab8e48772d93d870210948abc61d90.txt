Precisely.  Thank you.

Traffic analysis, jurisdiction, detection of encrypted data in stego'd 
files.

I believe the basic problem will be one of avoiding detection and the 
ability to piggyback harmless looking files on "approved" encryption.

In the event your encrypted message were detected, it would be nice if it 
didn't announce its intended destination via a public key header.

I also believe that excessively large keys should be incorporated 
(2048/4096 bit RSA and 256 bit IDEA like encryption perhaps) to extend the
likely useful life of cyphers which will be difficult to distribute later.

I also would like to see applications which permit the user to select the 
from among a few types of encryption, in the event one is found to be broken.

I'm pretty confident in it, but I would like to see some others about.

I think one of the big hold ups is the wait for PGP 3.0

Exactly.

I concur.

As I understood the current implementation, stego is fairly easy to sniff 
out.  Am I mistaken in this?

Perhaps, but hardly as suspicious as sending naked random data.  I think 
given hard to sniff stego, and the nationwide bandwidth, this is a non-issue.

Indeed.

I believe all these to be in everyone's best interest.
