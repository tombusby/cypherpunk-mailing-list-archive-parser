Then sign me off.  If something that inane were to go out with the
word "cypherpunk" affixed to it, I'd cringe.  It could only be worse
if it ended with the catchphrase "hack the planet".

I won't even dignify this by calling it speculation; it's simply and
absolutely wrong.  Any "Netscape insiders" are locked out; they
couldn't manipulate the stock price if they wanted to, and if they
have any brains in their heads at all they're absolutely the last
people on earth who'd make a move that stupid.  It won't be until
January at the very earliest that anyone who holds restricted shares
will be allowed to trade.  The stock's in all likelihood being bounced
back and forth between big technology funds, who don't give a rat's
ass about some security bug in the product.

Huh?  Do you actually have any earthly idea how the market works?

Ridiculous.

I'll eat my shoe if that happens.
