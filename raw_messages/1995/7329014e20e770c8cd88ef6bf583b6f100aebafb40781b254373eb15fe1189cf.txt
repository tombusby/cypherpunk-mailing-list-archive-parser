You also might point out that commercial escrow is in a way MORE prone to 
compromise because it effectively doubles the number of entities entitled 
to demand release of the keys.

Instead of JUST government, you now have to face the possibility of key 
forfeiture by BOTH government and the commercial escrow agent, the escrow 
agent being, as it is, subject to the whim of governmental coercion to 
release keys as well as the agent's own reasons for doing so.

Effectively the potential for misuse is increased by virtue of the 
increased numbers of officals (commercial and public) who have access to 
the material.

I would like to hear the answer to this dilemna, which I am sure will 
include something about commercial key escrow easing the perceptions of 
the public, to which the obvious response will be, "Then this is a 
public relations move to avoid the perception of potential government abuse 
and a move which infact increases the level of risk, is that right?"

Perhaps I should attend.  Where and when is this precisely?
