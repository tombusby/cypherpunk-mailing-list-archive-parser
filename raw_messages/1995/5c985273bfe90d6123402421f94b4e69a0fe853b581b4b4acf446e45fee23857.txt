It is.  Java scans the applet to make sure it doesn't try to cheat
the interpreter into violating the object access rules.  The scanning
has nothing to do with viruses.

Java doesn't try to prevent viruses (viri?).  It doesn't even claim
such.  It *does* make claims that imply limits on what the virus can
do, though.  If the virus does no more than eat up CPU cycles, it's
fairly benign.  Java is supposed to prevent viruses that destroy files
and damage equipment.  This feature isn't restricted to viruses, though.
Even non-replicating programs aren't supposed to be able to hurt anything.

Whether they achieve this goal or not is a matter of some debate.
