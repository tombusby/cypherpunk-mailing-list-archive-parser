 Upon a closer look, I see there's no mistake. The algorithm will
never reach k=n because the loop stops at n+1.

 Anyway, I played around with the algorithm a little, and it's neat
and easy to implement, but the speed increase is not worth
the patent hassle (assuming there is a speed increase, I saw none)

  The algorithm is still basically O(n^2) if used in a modexp
routine. It requires n^2 multiplications and additions. Whereas,
a typical Karatsuba multiplication using a high precision
reciprocal will only use 2*n^1.5 multiplications and 5*n^1.5/8
additions. (for n=64 which is a 2048-bit number being reduced, 
it's about 1/5 the multiplications, but 5 times the additions)


Two other possible algorthms are:

Let P(x) = sum(i=0 to n-1) a_i x^i be a multiprecision integer
radix x.

If m is a modulus, of length n/2, rewrite P(x) as

sum(i=0 to n/2-1) a_i x^i  + x^(n/2) (a_{n/2 + i} x^i)

break the summation into two parts. Focus on the second term.
(both terms are not equal, or one digit larger than the modulus)
Perform modular reduction of the right hand polynomial using
Horner's method

x*(x*(x*...(x*a_i + a{i-i} mod m)mod m)mod m) 

Those internal mod m's can be done quickly with a 2-digit
trial quotient estimation.


It's still O(n^2), but might be quicker.

Still another technique..

Rewrite P(x) 

(a_0 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x^4 + ...) + x (a_1 + a_3 x^2 + a_5 x^4 + ...)

[broken into two Polys with odd and even terms)
Factor out x^2 out of each piece and write

a_0 + ((a_2 + a_4 x^2 + a_6 x^4 + ...)*x^2) + 
x*(a_1 + x^2*(a_3 + a_5 x^2 + a_7 x^4 + ...)

Now keep applying the recursive rule until the length of the
poly pieces are the same or smaller than the modulus. Now,
start evaluating from the inner layers. Multiply each piece by
x^2 (two shifts), and take the mod. Sum the results, shifting one side by 
1 (for the x factor). Shifts are free because an array representation
yields a shift with a pointer movement.


It looks kinda like the method for evaluating  FFTs a little bit,
but it's not. Just something off the top of my head just now.
(I hereby place it in the public domain assuming it's worth
anything, no patents please)  I think with a clever implementation, you can 
trade some mults for more adds, but still use less additions than russian 
peasant.
