I have begun searching the unwanted 31 bit keyspace cd70000000 to cdefffffff
and according to my calculations will be able to search two blocks of
31 bits a night until I get bored of starting the searches.

I will be running 8+ hp9000/715s at 27,200 keys/second each.

If someone was planning on searching this keyspace, let's decide on it.

Thanks to those who helped me get going.
