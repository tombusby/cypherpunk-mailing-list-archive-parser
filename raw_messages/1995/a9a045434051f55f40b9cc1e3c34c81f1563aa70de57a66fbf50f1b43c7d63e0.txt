The Clipper chip itself does not use digital signatures and public key
encryption.  It only implements an block cypher.  You were probably talking
about Capstone which does use PK crytpo and digital signatures.  Capstone
uses DSS as the digital signature which is explicitly pointed out in the
summary of the timing attack.  I don't think what algorithm it uses for
key exchange has been releases yet, but it probably is vulnerable.  So
Capstone is indeed vulnerable to timing attacks.
