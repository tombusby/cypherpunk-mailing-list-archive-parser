A government agency is looking for something to ensure that files copied
from a Windows 95 machine do not contain any data from unused space on the
hard drive. I'm curious too.

Perhaps a command.com hack that zeroes out any bits outside the actual
file? The problem is that existing utilities do not work because Win95
disables direct disk access to preserve VFAT. A delete utility is not
sufficient, because they are also worried about temporary files created by
Win95 programs.
