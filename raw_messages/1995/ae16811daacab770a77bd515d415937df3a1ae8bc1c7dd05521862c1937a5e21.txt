I trust that that the attack refered to is the "man-in-the-middle". I find
it very curious that there is a simple fix to the attack for the enctrypted
voice channel. Each unit displays to its human a few bits of g^(xy). One
human quotes them vocally to the other. If there is a man in the middle the
bits are unlikely to match. What I find curious is that there seems to be
no automated analog to this precaution. It has to do with the difficulty of
substituting the vocal signals that code these bits. This is too hard for
either computer or man (in the middle). I write to stimulate a solution. I
have none.
