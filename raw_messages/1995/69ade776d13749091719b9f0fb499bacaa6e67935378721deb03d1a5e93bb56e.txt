As a deep cover agent for Icelandic Intelligence, I wandered down to my
local Babbages this weekend and bought (for cash) a copy of the US version
of the Netscape Browser.  The $6/hour clerk did not ask for my passport (or
birth certificate plus government photo ID).  For Netscape's (and Babbages')
sake, I hope the Feds don't find out.
