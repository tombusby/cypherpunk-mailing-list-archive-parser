When I lived in California, I banked at Security Pacific, then changed
over my account to BofA.  When I left the bay area, I closed my account,
not knowing that someone had sat on a check for $120 - I thought it was me
just entering an ATM receipt twice (as I do from time to time).  So,
someone from a place called ChexSystems sends me a letter, saying "well,
you had a check go through and the bank paid it, please pay us."  So, I
send them the $120 or whatever it was. 

When I tried to open a checking acount in Utah, I find that I can't, for
the sole reason that I had been "reported to ChexSystems".  I explained
the situation to no avail.  BofA refuses to remove the charge, saying that
it's "against their policy".  ChexSystems refuses to do anything about it,
saying that "it was a valid debt", one which I neither knew about nor
agreed to.  If the bank would've mailed me a letter, saying that they
bounced the check, or paid it and please remit, I would've been happy to. 
Instead, they chose to try and screw me over by reporting the so-called
"debt" to some sort of check reporting system.  From my point of view, the
action by the bank was malicious and done with the intent of causing me
harm.  I don't recommend anyone doing business with BofA for this reason,
and I strongly urge that people immediately close their accounts with BofA,
refuse to do business with them, and switch to another bank which refuses
to participate in such malicious practices. 

I'm *not* impressed.
