i seriously doubt that sameer keeps logs, as i believe he runs
a cypherpunks remailer.  furthermore, regardless of how anyone
feels about the state of sameer's courage, attacking his integrity
is utterly ridiculous.  he hasn't given out anyone's userid, 
nobody's anonymity has been compromised, and to suggest that
because you don't like his decision in this matter that he's
going to go around coughing up userids and personal identities
is completely ridiculous.  ridiculous beyond belief.

i agree with jukka.  sameer's given us no reason not to trust
him, even if he's given us a bit of attitude.  i'd probably
have responded in about the same way if i were suddenly dragged
into what you have to admit is an extremely convoluted and 
bizarre netwar with an alarming tendency to get people's 
computers confiscated and homes attacked.
