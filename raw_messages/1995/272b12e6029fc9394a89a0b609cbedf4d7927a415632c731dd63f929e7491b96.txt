The Wall Street Journal's Money & Investing Update (http://update.wsj.com)
has now introduced Company Briefing Books, a major product enhancement that
enables Update readers to get a rich, up-to-the-minute background report on
any company in the news.

Briefing Books are highly graphical compilations of recent news, stock
charts, and financial data, available on more than 6,500 U.S. and
international companies. They include news from The Wall Street Journal and

Books from nearly every significant mention of a company in Update stories
and tables. In addition, readers can ask for a Briefing Book on a company of
their choosing at any time simply by entering a company name or stock symbol.
