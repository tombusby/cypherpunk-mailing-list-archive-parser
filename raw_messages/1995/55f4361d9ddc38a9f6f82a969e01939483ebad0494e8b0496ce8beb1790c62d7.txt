There is no way in which the security of Mixmaster messages is LESS than
that of type I (cypherpunk) remailers.

Yes, each remailer is limited to knowing the previous and next
destinations. 

A Mixmaster remailer can only tell if it is first, last, or somewhere in
the middle. No information is leaked about position in the chain. There is
a hard limit of 20 hops.

Version 1.0 (which was released but not widely used or promoted) used
PGPTools by Pr0duct Cypher. This is a library which provides hooks for most
of the major PGP routines. The main problem with PGPTools is that I could
not get it to compile on anything but a SUN. The other problem was that it
was difficult to control the encryption so I could avoid any change in the
size of information when it was encrypted. RSAREF is very portable, robust,
supported, easy to work with, and was easy to use for fine control of the
encryption process. RSAREF is also much less of a black box to me. I can
understand what it is doing in detail.

Because of the message size limitations there are some advantages to
sending the mixmaster chain through some type 1 remailers first, rather
than sending a type 1 message in a Mixmaster packet.

It is very difficult to know what fraction of the traffic I see is cover. I
generate some cover traffic my self, and I know some others do as well.
Right now a reordering pool of 5 messages results in a latency of about 30
min. Mixmaster is no longer a small fraction of the remailer market. A
majority of all public remailers support Mixmaster.

This is not quite correct, at each hop your message could have gone to any
remailer at all. There are now 16 Mixmaster remailers in operation. If you
have two good remailers in your chain (not run by the enemy), then a given
message into the system is probably one of the messages that emerges
between 10 Min and several hours later (with some complex probability
distribution over that time). Note that because of the way the reordering
is done, messages could stay in the pool forever, but this is exponentially
less likely with time.

It turns out that this is good security for one message, but is much less
secure if you continue to communicate with the same person for some time.
Then the attacker can look for correlations between your sending a message,
and everyone who receives them. After several messages in one month, you
will stand out, unless you send cover messages regularly, so you correlate
with everyone all the time (destroying any information about who you
actually correspond with).
