I've decided to cancel my CrampuNerve account and send the weasels a msg to
telling them why. I encourage everyone here to do the same with your CI$
account (if you still have one). These [insert colorful expletive here]s
only understand one thing: cold ca$h. Thus, the only effective way to send
them an indication of one's displeasure at their poor precedent-setting is
to vote with one's wallet.

Any who are still unfortunate enough to rely on CI$ for Internet/Usenet
access are getting reamed price-wise anyway, not to mention suffering poor
reliability and now access, so maybe a few of them could also take this
opportunity to migrate to an ISP with some real "backbone."

CI$ is becoming redundant and now they're making themselves unappealing.
Convenient, economical dialups are now available to Europeans and any of us
Yanks who have to travel to Europe regularly through various
non-anus-kissing ISPs (xs4all, iSYS, etc.). Back in '90-'92 CI$ used to be
somewhat handy when travelling to Europe, but even then it was horribly
expensive when you tallied up their "surcharges" for dialing in through
Frankfurt, etc.

Good riddance, say I.
