This is really interesting to me:

Ok, sounds good... but what I don't understand is further on:

[ that I can understand ]

This is where I start scratching my head.  I mean, how exactly will
the software be able to tell that what's being fed into it came from a
Good version versus an Evil version of the cryptosystem?  Isn't that
very issue the reason for Skipjack being (A) secret and (B) kept on a
supposedly auto-desctruct chip?

If the algorithm is public (and to stretch a point, if the executable
makes it onto somebody's hard disk, it's effectively public), I don't
really understand how the above can be made a realistic goal.  I'd
always thought that the idea behind software key escrow was that it'd
be stuck into most "name-brand" tools, so that Joe Lazy AOL User
wouldn't bother (or wouldn't know how) to circumvent it.  (Still seems
kinda ridiculous, but maybe that's just me.)  Anyway, this document
makes it seem like somebody seriously expects this is doable.  If it
is, then I *really* want to know how (because I'd like to exploit that
sort of technology myself...).

Ooh.

Hmm...

Well there go the manufacturing costs up through the roof...

I guess that'd work with the somewhat weak mechanisms used with
"unlockable" CD-ROM stuff.

Again, how can it tell?

Maybe I'm just being dense.
