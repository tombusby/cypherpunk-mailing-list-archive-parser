Most modems I've seen only have one set of audio interfaces,
and a bump-in-the-cord phone needs two (one for the voice side,
one for the modem line side.)  (Having two jacks doesn't count.)
So you'd need at least two modems, one straight and one re-educated,
and you'd probably need lots more flash ROM than the average modem has.

On the other hand, laptops are increasingly getting multimedia capabilities
like built-in sound cards, and if there's a microphone jack you're in 
business (uh, well, for $3K or so)   Or a cheaper laptop with two PCMCIA modems,
if you can re-educate one, which also lets you move the non-audio parts
of your secure phone program into the PC.  Of course, if you want long
conversations from the airport, you'll still need to find a payphone
within 4-6 feet of an electric socket and not located under a MegaMuzak speaker,
but that's easier than trying to balance a TI Silent 700 under similar
conditions :-)
