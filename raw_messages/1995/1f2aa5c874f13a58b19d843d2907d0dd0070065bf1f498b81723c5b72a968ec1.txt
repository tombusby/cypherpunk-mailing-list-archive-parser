>Art Hutchinson and John Kelly of Northeast Consulting Resources, Inc. (NCRI)
>will facilitate an interactive exercise that helps to paint a picture of the
>group's collective thinking about future events and milestones
>in the development of electronic commerce.  Specifically, we will be culling
>through the last year of posts to www-buyinfo, e-payment, and various other
>mailing lists, as well as our own database of 17,000 "events" used in
>previous scenario planning conferences.  From this, we will be create a set
>of about 40 potential future events which - depending upon whether they
>happen or not - will drive the digital commerce arena in varying directions.
>
>
>Everyone at the lunch will be given an opportunity to 'vote' on and discuss
>with their peers the likelihood (or un-likelihood) of these events happening
>within a particular time frame.  After the 'voting', we will lead a
>discussion of what the results might mean, and how some things that this
>group believes correspond to what other corporate and industry groups have
>said in the recent past in voting on some of the same events.  Suggestions
>for controversial, interesting, watershed events that might happen in the
>digital commerce arena over the next 3-5 years are welcome.  Please e-mail
