I got it at 09:14, Pacific Daylight Time, so there appears to be no lag.

I've generally found that lags are on my end, that my system (got.net
currently) is delaying mail from _all_ or _most_ mailing lists. (This was
particularly the case last week, when Cypherpunks mail stopped for many
hours at a time, then arrived out of sequence when my ISP was (presumably)
able to receive the resent mail.)

Well, the main issue with the "Europe to Ban Crypto" reposts was that
several people reposted the same press release over a period of several
days, and the case I cited here was  where it was posted a week later. I
can't see how a latency, even a serious latency of several hours, could
cause this to happen.

Mostly I think people should try to first of all, _write original stuff_.
That is, write their own analyses of things. Their own essays, reactions,
etc. Then, secondarily, post pointers to longer stuff. Thirdly, and less to
be desired, forward articles.
