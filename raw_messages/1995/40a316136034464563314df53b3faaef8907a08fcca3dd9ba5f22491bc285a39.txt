Okay, that was basically what I was suggesting.  A full binary difference
file wouldn't even need to have any information about the internals of the
program anyway.

Basically, what needs to be achieved is a way to allow the software
manufacturer to sell an approved product outside the country, but allow the
foreign buyer to (easily) convert it into a GOOD encryption product.  Once
that works, laws against the export of encryption are meaningless.  In fact,
the legally-exported program obviously wouldn't even need to HAVE encryption
in it at all, so it won't fall under ITAR classification, and thus won't
need any kind of export license.
