     How to get there (all directions are written as if 101 really went 
     north and south):
                          HOW TO FIND THE APARTMENT
     
     The address is 2040 W. Middlefield #22, but ignore that fact.  It is 
     much easier to find if you firmly believe that the address is 2040 
     Rock Ave. #22.  From the corner of Rock & Rengstorff, follow the big 
     lighted "2040" numbers along Rock.  Just after the second driveway on 
     Rock you will find a walkway into the complex...follow the walkway to 
     #19, then climb the stairs to #22.
     
                 HOW TO FIND THE CORNER OF ROCK & RENGSTORFF
     
     Cypherpunks:  From La Castena (the burrito place), just go one block 
     "west" on Rengstorff.
     
     From Highway 101 southbound:  Take Rengstorff exit, which makes a 
     180-degree loop.  Turn left onto Rengstorff westbound (away from the 
     bay, toward the ocean).   One block after Old Middlefield (and one 
     block before Middlefield), turn left on Rock Ave and park on Rock.  
     See above to find the apartment.
     
     From Highway 101 northbound:  Ignore the Middlefield exit.  Take 
     Rengstorff exit, which makes a 270-degree loop and merges onto 
     Rengstorff westbound (away from the bay, toward the ocean).   One 
     block after Old Middlefield (and one block before Middlefield), turn 
     left on Rock Ave. and park on Rock.  See above to find the apartment.
     
     From 680 at Dunbarton exit:  Taking the Dunbarton bridge to 101 is a 
     few minutes faster, but it's easy to get lost between the bridge and 
     101.  Unless you're familiar with the area, we recommend taking 680 to 
     237, west on 237 to 101, and north on 101 to the Rengstorff exit, 
     which makes a 270-degree loop and merges onto Rengstorff westbound 
     (away from the bay, toward the ocean).   One block after Old 
     Middlefield (and one block before Middlefield), turn left on Rock Ave. 
     and park on Rock.  See above to find the apartment.
     
     Further complications..er, clarifications:  Rock Ave. and Rock St. are 
     the same thing.  Middlefield Road and Old Middlefield Road are two 
     different things.
