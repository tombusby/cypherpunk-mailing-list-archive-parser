Hal quotes the 1/16/95 EE Times:
> "Zimmermann is not in danger of being indicted

This is very odd indeed. It reminds me of the "like-a-book" shrink-wrap
software license agreements. Did they expect PRZ to run PGP solely on
a single computer at home, and allow house guests to use it ? Copies of a
piece of software can obviously be handled in any fashion by their possessors.
I can't conceive of a way to make software available without distributing
copies, other than allowing global execute permission (but not read permission)
for a copy running on an *ahem* "unhackable" server. I find it difficult to
believe, however, that arms export control statutes written for munitions
hardware mandate this extreme restriction on access. Such laws would turn the
export-controlled section of a gun store into an analogue of the reference
section of a library -- "you can use it here, but you can't check it out".
People using strong crypto remotely are forced to trust the remote crypto
server to some extent, which tends to defeat the whole purpose of the exercise.
It also starts to sound like a model for GAK.... :[

Anyone have an email address for someone at EE Times ?
