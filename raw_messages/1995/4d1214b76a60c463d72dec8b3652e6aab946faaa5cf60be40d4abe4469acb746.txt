   Assistant Devil's Angel Ingraham cites two out of three,
   the other is the omnipresent public safety racket -- his
   temp job in train to future peace by salubrious punishment
   of the other two overtense sinners.

   Often, a backlasher rep in one leads to a pretend-
   thrasher slot in the others. RICO, for instance, is an
   ingenious selective-caning law for flyswatting one
   conspirator by another but to not go so far as to bruise
   flesh and foreclose franchises for prosecutorial
   "shiatsu."

   This ancient soft-drubbing by one of the others is meant to
   conceal their common-origin ritual of corporeal writhings,
   manipulations, strokings, caresses and digitizers to debase
   from upright to bent to kneeling to prone succeeding down
   ladder, applying lubricants, linguants, unguents, balms, 
   dental whiteners and body hair to head, to rest six under.

   Criminal, financial, legal -- indistinguishable from any
   other mortality-salving levitationism.
