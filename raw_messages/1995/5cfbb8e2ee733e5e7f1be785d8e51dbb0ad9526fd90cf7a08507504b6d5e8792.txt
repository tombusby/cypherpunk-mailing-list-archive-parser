While true certain small programs may be larger in size; the difference
will decrease as the programs grow in complexity. With the natural stong
point of true object oriented code reusing more code as the program grows
the difference may still measurably be there but will be hardly noticeable.

<IMHO> it is the future of the net  

I see this being the last step that get's coporations on the net ...  making
money in a *relativly* secure way ... good or bad is another thread which I
don't want to be a part of.
