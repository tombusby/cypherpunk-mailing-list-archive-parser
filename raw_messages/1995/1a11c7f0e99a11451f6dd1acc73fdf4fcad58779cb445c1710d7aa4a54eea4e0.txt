Ditto.  The next major hack of Netscape will likely be used to 
bring that company to its knees. Unless one assumes that 
obvious backdoors will still be unprotected by their new code, 
a lot of computing time for brute force attacks and algorithm 
development will have to be spent to properly crack Netscape 
again. I seriously doubt the successful individuals will 
merely settle for fame and not fortune this time around.

OTOH I would much rather see MS get hacked next. If the 
rumors of MS being a Hard Drive Peeping Tom are true, then I 
wonder if there might be a way to send a byte bomb to their 
bit bucket??.......

Be Well
