Not surprising. They confuse random doodling with software, too.

The real problem with NetManage is a severe case of brain death.
The Sampler TCP/IP sucks, the paid-up TCP/IP is so-so, but of 
the clients, only ftp is fair, and the rest bite. All the
NetManage clients I've tried crater, Mail can't rebuild its
index structures if they are corrupted (uh, what was it that 
rebuild was supposed to do, Harvey?), the version of WebSurfer
I evaluated took longer and longer to load and shut down, 
revealed on inspection to be due to loading/storing a very wordy 
global history in its, ahem, config file! Delete it and your 
config is gone. 

I wouldn't concern myself with what crypto is or isn't in a 
NetManage product -- they are not players as far as I'm 
concerned. They've been riding the wave of their TCP/IP not 
crashing as often as some others, but otherwise they're vacuum 
packed, untouched by coherent human thought.
