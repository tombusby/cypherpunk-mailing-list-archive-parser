  This technique has been discussed before.  It will not work because
the 40-bit export version of SSL actually uses 128 bit keys, with 88 of
the bits transfered in the clear.  The extra 88-bits act as a "salt" to
the key.  This defeats attempts to do a single key space search for 
multiple messages.
