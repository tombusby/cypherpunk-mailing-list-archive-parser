The Int'l. Chamber of Commerce turns out to have Web pages. Their latest
press release on the web came out last week, describing the upcoming
conference: <a href="http://spider.usa1.com/~ibnet/iccpr883.html">Business
and governments seek agreed policy on encryption of electronic messages</a>

A few excerpts:

"OECD governments are participating in the two day conference, together with 
representatives of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the Business 
and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD (BIAC), and information 
technology associations covering Europe, Canada, Japan, and the United States."

"An ICC expert, Stefan Bernhard, said: `Just as government agencies are 
obliged to seek court warrants before making physical searches within a 
company, or in the home of a private person, the same restrictions should 
apply on the information superhighway.'"

"For further information contact Lionel Walsh at the ICC communications 
division (33 1) 49 53 28 23. Email - ICCOM@ibnet.com"
