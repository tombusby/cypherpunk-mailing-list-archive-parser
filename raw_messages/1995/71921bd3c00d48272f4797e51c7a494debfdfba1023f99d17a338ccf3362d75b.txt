	First off, let me congratulate you on inking this deal.  I hope that this 
will make a lot of interesting things possible, now that there is an RSAref 
toolkit outside the US, and also for commercial use in the US.

	I have a few questions, which I hope you can answer publically.

	Will there be a public, standard fee schedule?  Many companies would like to 
be able to use RSA technology for a fee, and would like to know what that fee 
is without having to explain their plans in great detail to RSA.  I know 
people who would like to be able to say, heres a check, we're shipping 
software using RSAref to 5000 desktops.

	Will you be adding access points to the software?  I know that PGP required 
new interfaces, previously unpublished, and that use of unpublished interfaces 
was also a problem RSA had with Wei Dai's excellent Crypto++ library.
