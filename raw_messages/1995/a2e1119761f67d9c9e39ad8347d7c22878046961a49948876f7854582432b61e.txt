Of course, if it was a substantial improvement over the
other "Internet Phone" stuff that's out there, and had
a good way of dealing with switching, etc., then people
would use it to make "free" l.d. phone calls on the net,
and the cryptography would get a free ride.

Generally, you are right in suggesting that anything that
requires people to crawl behind their computers, attach
new cables, purchase and debug a sound card under Windows,
and generally engage in techno-weenie hardware manipulations
will have less appeal than something plug and play. Even
given the extremely user-hostile elements of PGP the software,
I would be surprised if PGPFone became as popular.
