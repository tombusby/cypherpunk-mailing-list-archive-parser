>      MICROSOFT PUBLISHES SPECIFICATIONS DESIGNED TO HELP
>      IMPROVE SECURITY ON THE INTERNET
> 
>     ATLANTA, Sept. 27 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT)
> today announced the publication of two specifications that address key
> Internet security issues.  Software designed with these specifications
> will enable developers to incorporate improved security technology into
> their applications, giving businesses and consumers confidence that
> their transactions and communications will be secure.
>     The two specifications -- Secure Transaction Technology (STT) and
> Private Communication Technology (PCT) -- were published today on the
> Internet.  To help encourage widespread adoption of STT and PCT,
> Microsoft is making the specifications available at no charge to all
> software developers, businesses, card brands and financial institutions
> that want to create STT-compliant and PCT-compliant applications.  Both
> can be found on the Microsoft home page (http//:www.microsoft.com).
>     "We set out a year ago to build STT, a security system that meets
> the strict requirements of the payment-card industry.  STT's design uses
> sophisticated cryptographic techniques to help protect and authenticate
> consumers, merchants and financial institutions that use bank cards to
> conduct business on the Internet," said Craig Mundie, senior vice
> president of the consumer systems division at Microsoft.  "After doing
> so, we felt we could also apply our expertise to the Internet's need for
> general-purpose security.  PCT builds upon Secure Sockets Layer by
> incorporating strong authentication and other technologies we developed
> for STT."
>     STT, jointly developed with Visa International, is supported by the
> Internet Shopping Network, RSA Data Security Inc. and Spyglass Inc.  The
> PCT specification is supported by Cylink Corp., FTP Software Inc.,
> Internet Shopping Network, NetManage Inc., OpenMarket Inc., Spyglass
> Inc. and Starwave Corp.
>     "We cannot afford to have doubt cast over the ability to conduct
> business on the Internet," said Marc Miller, executive vice president of
> marketing and business development for Spyglass Inc.  "We applaud
> Microsoft for approaching the security issue as it should be approached
> -- in an open forum within the Internet community.  Our whole business
> model is based on partnerships.  We're happy to be working with
> Microsoft to provide an open, specifications-based solution to help
> ensure the viability of this exciting new medium."
>     The Secure Transaction Technology specification, jointly developed
> by Microsoft and Visa, is designed to provide a secure method for
> handling credit-card transactions across private and public networks.
> By providing a technology that can be completely integrated with the
> current bank-card system, STT will serve as a reliable payment system
> for software providers to incorporate into their products.  STT also
> preserves the branded transaction relationships that merchants and
> financial institutions have with their customers.
>     The Private Communication Technology specification is designed to
> secure general-purpose business and personal communications on the
> Internet.  PCT includes features such as privacy, authentication and
> mutual identification.  As a secure communications technology, PCT
> builds on the earlier advances embodied in Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
> PCT enhances SSL by separating authentication from encryption.  This
> means that PCT allows applications to use authentication that is
> significantly stronger than the 40-bit key limit for encryption allowed
> by the U.S. government for export.
>     "The Internet Shopping Network is committed to providing the most
> secure online shopping environment possible," said Boris Putanec, vice
> president of engineering for the Internet Shopping Network.  "STT
> delivers one of the highest levels of security and authentication for
> shopping transactions, boosting electronic commerce."
>     Microsoft plans to incorporate both STT and PCT into its own
> products, such as the Microsoft(R) Internet Explorer 2.0, which ships
> with the Window(R) operating system, and is encouraging other software
> developers to do the same.
>     The specifications released by Microsoft include use of encryption
> capabilities based on technology from RSA Data Security Inc.
>     Founded in 1975, Microsoft is the worldwide leader in software for
> personal computers.  The company offers a wide range of products and
> services for business and personal use, each designed with the mission
> of making it easier and more enjoyable for people to take advantage of
> the full power of personal computing every day.

>     Microsoft is either a registered trademark or trademark in the
> United States and/or other countries.
