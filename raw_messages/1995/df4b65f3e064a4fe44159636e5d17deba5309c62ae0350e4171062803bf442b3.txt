I might be.

Excellent idea.  Then it could be brought to the attention of a candidate
or two that have net.crime on their agendas.

Well, I don't know about the last part - it seems to me that opinions
would be mixed.

The only thing that I'm not sure of is the use of ecash - mostly
because I haven't really been keeping track of the state of the
art.  Could some people who are better informed on the subject
discuss whether this is a feasible way to use it?

I wasn't actually thinking of rewards, mostly because you'd have to
arrange some sort of reply block from the anonymous tip mailbox.
Most people (even remailer users) don't know how or don't wish to
use these, so I don't know if that part would really fly.
