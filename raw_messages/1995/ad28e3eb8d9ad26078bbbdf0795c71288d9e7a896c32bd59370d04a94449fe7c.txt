What if all traffic routed through the US was automatically modified, say,
by inverting all bits, and then de-inverted after it exited the country. (a
software flag would alert the systems to this).  At the time it was
exported, it would not be runnable code, nor compilable source code.

Sure, somebody would claim that "it's easy to turn it into runnable code,
just by XORing the file with ones."  The response is obvious:  Every 100K
file is only a XOR away from every OTHER 100K file.
