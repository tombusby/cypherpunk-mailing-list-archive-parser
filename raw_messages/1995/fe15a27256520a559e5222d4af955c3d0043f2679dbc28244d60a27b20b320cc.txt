Just thought you may be interested in this. 
Anybody ever hear of this EFH group?  It's nice to see somebody making
PGP a little easier for the average jane/joe end-user-type to use.

: 		     Electronic Frontiers Houston
: 			      presents a
: 		     Free Cryptography Workshop:
: 		    How to use Pretty Good Privacy
: 				(PGP)
: 		      presented by Paul Elliott
: 			 14 January 1995 3PM
: 
: 
: It has become apparent that the data super highway is not safe. Messages
: traveling the data highway can be hijacked by sinister data interlopers.
: 
: After six months of unpaid labor, in June, 1991 Philip Zimmermann
: released his controversial freeware program Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).
: Just as Prometheus' liver was eternally chewed by eagles for the crime
: of bringing fire to mankind, Philip Zimmermann's liver is now being
: chewed by the Federal Eagle (The U.S. Custom Service) for the alleged
: crime of releasing strong cryptography to the world.
: 
: As a result of Philip Zimmermann's contribution, you can use the widely
: available freeware program PGP to send electronic-mail messages to
: anyone in the world, in complete privacy! In addition you can send
: authentication with your messages so that the recipient can verify that
: the message really came from you. You can encrypt sensitive files on
: your computer so that the files remain private even if your computer and
: disks are stolen.
: 
: In this free workshop, our presenter Paul Elliott will show you how you
: can use PGP effectively, easily, and intelligently. PGP is available for
: most popular computers and Operating Systems, including MSDOS, UNIX, MAC
: and OS/2 among many others.
: 
: The Workshop will take place at on January 14, at 3:00 PM at the
: offices of South Coast Computing located at 1811 Bering, Suite 100. Park
: in the garage, and ignore the "contract only" sign.  Enter through the
: back door (adjacent to the garage) and use the house phone (dial 100) if
: the door is locked.
