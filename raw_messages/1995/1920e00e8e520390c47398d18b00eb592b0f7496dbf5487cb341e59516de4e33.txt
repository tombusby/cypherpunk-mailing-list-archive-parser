You might want to check out Brian LaMacchia's Ph.D. proposal to create
a new class of knowbot, to be termed "Internet Fish".  It is posted on 
http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bal/bal-home.html

LaMacchia's proposal is interesting in that his 'fish' seem to have 
limited autonomy, thus moving us closer to a content-addressable model
of net info retrieval.

Also of interest is RFC 1728: Resource Transponders, by C. Weider.  The
idea is that there should be meta-information (information about 
information) available for use by info retrieval programs like 'archie'.

The following is extracted from LaMacchia's abstract:
