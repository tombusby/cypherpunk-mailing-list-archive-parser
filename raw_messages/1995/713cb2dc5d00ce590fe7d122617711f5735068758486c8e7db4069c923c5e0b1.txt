      "A stake in its heart," more like.

      Well, spamming the sign won't do.

      Aleph One's suggestion -- an NS-hack or "virus" -- doesn't make any
sense: if Perry or someone would vet a hacked copy, I'd use it in a
second. But hacking it would involve a violation of the license, so hacked
versions couldn't be offered in any above-ground way: there'd be no way to
certify a hacked copy with a trusted nym's key.
      Netscape is between a rock and a hard place: I think it's safe to
say that, were all things equal, NS would support strong crypto. The fact
that NS has decided otherwise suggests that some pressure was applied:
Clark says as much. This leads me to believe that one possibly effective
(and possibly dangerous) tactic might lie in a seriously sustained attack
on NS's reputation -- keeping up a meme-drumbeat of "you can't trust
Netscape, that's all, you'll get ripped off." I think we should try it --
TODAY, now, persistently and loudly, until NS comes around. I'm not saying
that this'll be enough, but it's a start. TODAY. And I really don't care
what it takes: calling cronies in the press, spreading innuendo, redoing
NS icon sets so there's a spy from "Spy Versus Spy" loitering behind the
N... I've seen some nice "NO Netscape" tags on GNU-related pages. Let's do
it.
