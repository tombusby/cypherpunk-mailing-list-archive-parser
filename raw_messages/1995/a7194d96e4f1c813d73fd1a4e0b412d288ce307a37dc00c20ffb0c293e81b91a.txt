Yes, I read your proposal. The "hooks" term is not my coinage, but refers
to this general idea. I urge you to read what others, including companies,
have had to say on this matter. Much of the debate on "interoperability"
revolves around details of entry points to crypto modules and such hooks.

No point in arguing with Jim on this anymore, so I won't.

Good luck, Jim, in introducing such a product.
