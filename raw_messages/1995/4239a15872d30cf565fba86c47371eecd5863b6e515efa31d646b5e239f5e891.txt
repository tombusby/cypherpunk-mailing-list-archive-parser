Don't hold your breath. The current market surveys say that there is no
market for them. Check out this weeks PC Week or Mac Week, as they both
have several articles discussing this. Bottem line is that the under $1000
computer seems to have no future either in industry or the home.

Realisticaly, who in their right mind would buy a diskless workstation to
connect to Internet? You certainly wouldn't do crypto on it because it has
to boot from somewhere else and this leaves all kinds of security holes.
Also, there is the fact that at the current time there are no generaly
useable apps on Internet beyond the web and most companies would rather have
their employees doeing something more productive than hanging ten.

Anyone who bases their business on this technology won't have a business.

Take care.
