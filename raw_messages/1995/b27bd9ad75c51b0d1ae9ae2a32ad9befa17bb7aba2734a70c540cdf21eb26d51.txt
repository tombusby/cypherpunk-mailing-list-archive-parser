Is there someplace that remailer operators routinely post information
about traffic load?

The reason I ask is that this issue can have a bearing on selection of
remailers for chaining.  Using Raph's list, one can gather an approximate
feel for latency and reliability, but there is no way to know if a
site is forwarding hundreds or thousands of messages a day (which would be
good for traffic analysis), or just a few tens (which makes in/out analysis
much easier.)

Raph's list is a good 'reputation' system; however, it lacks this one bit
of info which would be immensely helpful.  Periodic postings of remailer
frequency usage to alt.privacy.anon-server by the operators would be one
way to propagate this info.

Of course, I may be overlooking something basic:  Would posting this info
pose any kind of security weakness?  I imagine not; if someone wants to get
this info for traffic analysis, they just watch the remailer for a day or
so.
