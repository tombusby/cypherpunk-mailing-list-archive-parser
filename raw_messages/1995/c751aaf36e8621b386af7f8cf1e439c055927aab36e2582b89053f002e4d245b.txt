Yeah I saw both.

This was what I was trying to say.  I was thinking that it would be
useful if they would care to disclose this part of the implementation,
where the entropy comes from, and how they estimate it.

Absolutely, but can you see netscape adopting the GPL, with full
source availability?  Of course this would be ideal, but I was hoping
for at least the source as pertaining to the random number generator
which is the essence of the current problem.

Yeah well if open systems is taken to mean, we make up a standard,
tell you about it and if you don't like it well it's too late because
we've blasted it across the internet to the extent that there's no
turning back.

An approach more in keeping with the IETF frame work would have been
better.  If it's open standards why not accept existing standards, or
contribute to a IETF working group to decide one which is agreed upon.
I'd call that more open.

Well yes, but the current flaw the design wasn't even correct,
although the implementation of that design was.  Both would be ideal
but a design and proof of having audited it would be good if they are
expecting people to trust this thing for megabucks as internet
commerce takes off.

yup.

Well I highly doubt they'd GPL the code.  Or even make the code
available.  But it would be really, really nice if a fresh outlook was
taken on this, code is required to trust the thing, as that shows a
willingness to expose the workings, and confidence in the
implementation, and algorithms.  I hope some serious thought goes into
this issue at netscape, about giving out code for their security
implementation.

There are still possibilities for server bugs, and so on.

No, you can't.

Sadly, I presume that they have no intention of releasing source.  So
we'll have to be content with RSADSI security audit.  Or another
break.
