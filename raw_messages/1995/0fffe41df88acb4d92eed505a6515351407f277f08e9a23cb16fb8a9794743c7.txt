   This is the kicker!  If what I heard is true, anyone can escrow the keys
under this new plan.  We know that the govt has no problem breaking it's one
rules by saying the magic words "matter of national security", so why don't
they require the keys be held by the govt?
   ... You know they can break it.   ...  I guess they assume the middle
american will buy it!  Just kills me.
