  I agree and will call them s anonymity, and r anonymity cause I am
too lazy to type much.

  I'll call the combo of "sender -> remail network -> pool ->
reciever" by the term "repool" in this message.

  Not so.  Though Chaum's DC protocol does give s/r anonymity, it does
so at a large cost.  Much larger than the repool protocol.

  I think this is exactly the right aproach.  So, lets look at the
cost of ataining anonymity.  For U people to communicate M bits (total
-- 2 people each sending 2 bits is M==4) s/r anonymously takes O(U*M)
bits multicast bandwidth for Chaum's DC protocol, but the repool
protocol uses only O(h*M) bits narowcast bandwidth plus O(M) bits
multicast bandwidth (Where h is the average number of remailer hops,
expected to be a constant wrt U and M, smaller than U, and much smaller
than M).

  Chaum's DC protocol also assumes an _interactive_ speed multicast
network.  Ouch!  The multicast internet protocol does help addresses
this problem, but it isn't widely available.  IRC is perhaps a bit
more expensize, more widely available, but lower bandwidth than
multicast IP packets.

  Chaum's DC protocol achieves U way s/r anonymity for U times the
work of sending a message.  Chaum's DC protocol provides s anonymity
as conditional as the cryptosystem achieves privacy (i.e.
uncomditional for one time pads, and dependant on 'strong
cryptosystems' assumption for the 'conventional' DC net).  Like the
repool protocol, it provides unconditional r anonymity.

  The repool protocol achieves U way s/r anonymity for no more than h
times the work of sending a message.  The repool protcol (by use of a
pool) provides unconditional (U-way) r anonymity, but (due to using
remailers) only provide conditional (U-way) s anonymity (conditional
on there existing at least one trusted remailer in the chain, and on
the existance of strong cryptosystems).  The repool protocol also
suffers from TA attacks like those sugested by Wei (at least as
currently implemented).

  What we would like is for the work to scale sub-linearly (ideally
exp(-U)) with the number of users U.  Said another way, we would like
U to scale faster than linearly as a function of the work (ideally
exp(W)).  If the effort of a protocol scales linearly (or worse) with
U, I don't think it will become widely employed.  Even better would be
a system which provided s/r anonymity without using multicast
bandwidths at all.  Btw, what is the cost of multicast v.s. narowcast
(say SMTP bassed) today on the net?

  Noyb
