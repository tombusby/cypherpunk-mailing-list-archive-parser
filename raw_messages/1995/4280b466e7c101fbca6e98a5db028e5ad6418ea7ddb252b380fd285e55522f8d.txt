Well, the more you adapt to the information theory point of view, the more
the Shannon-Kolmogoroff-Chaitin definitions become the natural ones, then
the more the whole "thermodynamic" definition of entropy will seem the odd
one.

One is left with the conclusion that Gibbs-style entropy has _something_
fundamental to do with information theory, and can then consider what those
relationships may be.

But, perforce, one is left with the most basic interpretation of
algorithmic complexity: the complexity of a system is related to the length
of the algorithm describing it. A "random" system is one which has no
shorter algorithmic description than itself.

(The connection of this statement to IQ test questions about describing a
sequence is left as an IQ test question for the reader.)
