I'd love to see the system described in H. Beam Piper's "A Planet for
Texans" implemented. Under that system, all Politicians are BY LAW
representing the interests of ALL their constituents. Any constituent who
feels that he/she is not being adequately represented (or feels that
his/her views/interests are being misrepresented) is by law granted total
access to the Politician and may register this disapproval of the
Politician's Performance in any way up to and including killing the
Politician. If the Politician (or his/her survivors/friends <g>) feel that
the constituent used excessive force (such as using a car bomb or a long
distance weapon like a rifle as opposed to using a personal weapon such as
a hand gun at close range) or force out-of-proportion to the action being
protested, they can bring charges in the "Court of Political Justice". In
such a trial it is the job of the prosecution (ie: The Politician or
Representatives) to prove that the constituent did, in fact, overstep the
accepted rules for registering disapproval.
