	I saw this article in alt.privacy.

	Anybody think the described encryption actually is worth 
	looking at.

Dear Mr. Chaos,

We are talking about a 72 bit engine that is more than 
sufficiently strong for time sensitive general business purposes. 
In addition it does not rely merely on simple factoring but a 
process called graphical encryption that adds additional 
difficulty to an attack. I would like to see if your cracking 
abilities are anywhere near your abilities to return an 
uninformed answer. I invite you to try your skill.

David
