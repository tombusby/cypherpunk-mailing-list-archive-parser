Don't mention it! After all, all right-thinking Cypherpunkz are intensely
interested in these mailing lists you sent this to:

abducted@hyperreal.com  (many Cypherwonks are alien abductees!)

flat-earth@zikzak.net   (where the "edge" culture meets the edge of the Earth)

email@fringeware.com  (yes, we're at the fringe)


So nice to know that we're lumped in with these folks.
