These are well-known applications. The drug enforcement folks have programs
running at a place called the "El Paso Information Center" (EPIC), from
what I recall. Analyzing flights, passenger lists, etc., using various
AI/pattern recognition programs. (Some say the El Paso locale has tendrils
reaching to E Systems, Cray installations, etc., but I wouldn't know.)

I recall reading of some contracts let out, and other RFCs, for AI programs
for FinCEN use. Not surprising. (If I ran FinCEN, this is what I'd surely
have a bunch of folks working on. Scary thought.)

A bunch of AI-oriented job shops, such as Kestrel Institute and ADS, have
links to intelligence and law enforcement. Really too many possible
examples, and not surprising.

Sure. Preprocessing of intercepts and signals, etc., is a natural application.

The point about neural nets not likely to be used in pure cryptanalysis was
a carefully limited point.
