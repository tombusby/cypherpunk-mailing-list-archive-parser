That opens it wide open to someone NAKing the keyspace where the key is.
If we're going to involve a server, might as well do the sequential job
and make it fast.

Some kind of step (ie, round-down) function performed on the random (I
vote we call it a dart) output, with the size of the step based on the how
many segments at once you want to search? Seems to me that all your doing 
is searching an X segment area around where the dart hit. In order to
get any kind of boundry, you have to scale the allowed segment blocks, by 
powers of two, for example, or something, so everyone knows where the 
borders are. Its a nice thought but I don't see that it's necessary.

If, on the other hand, sequential searchers plow through half of the
keyspace while a "random crew" throws darts at the other half, everyone
can participate how they wish. And if the keyserver gets deep-six'd by a
Denial of Service attack (or just swamped), everyone can just switch into
random mode and shotgun the keyspace. (Maybe even avoiding what's already 
been sequentially-searched)
