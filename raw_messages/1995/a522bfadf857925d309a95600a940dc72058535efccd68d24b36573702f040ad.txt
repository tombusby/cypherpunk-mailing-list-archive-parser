Well, that's an interesting question.
On one hand, it's a proprietary encryption algorithm, written by a bright
17 year old.

On the other hand, there have been no reported cracks, no "decrypt your
encrypted archives" programs like there are for MS Word, or WordPerfect.
(Maybe it's hard, maybe no one cares.)
[ Late breaking news: "t byfield" reported one; it appears not to work. ]

On the gripping hand, there was no trouble getting export approval.

Many people/companies put encrypted Stuffit archives up for anonymous ftp.
(Beta versions of executables, etc)

How far should you trust it?
That's up to you.
