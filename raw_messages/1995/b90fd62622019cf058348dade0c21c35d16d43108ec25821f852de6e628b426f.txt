Yes, as I suggested a number of details would be necessary to avoid this.
Reporting only cumulative donations, occasionally over a long period of time
(once every three months, for instance), and even then only approximating
the total number would make  doing such a correlation extremely difficult.

The blinding needs only be temporary; long enough so the politician can't
act improperly on the donation, but  eventually revealed in enough time to
expose political influence before  the next election.


Besides, I have already proposed what I consider to be a _better_ method of
reforming government.  It's called "Assassination Politics."  Perhaps you've
heard of it.
