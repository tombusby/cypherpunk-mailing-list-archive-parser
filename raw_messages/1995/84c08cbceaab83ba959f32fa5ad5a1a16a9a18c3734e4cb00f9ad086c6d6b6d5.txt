Is not in the kernel, this is just the permissions on /dev/*random.

Hmm. Lemme think about this...

How about SetGID? We were going for 660 root.kmem.

Ponder... I'll put this forward.

What happens if some attacker does:

for (;;) {
	write_to_devrandom(NULL);
	check_to_see_if_state_is_crackable();
}

? "Gut feel" suggests to me that large ammounts of "predicted" input might
be worse than the normal sort of system noise you have been using.

Clue me in - I'm not quite with you? :-)

Is this millisecond accuracy quantifiable in terms of bits of entropy?
if so, the ethernet is surely safe?

Again, if you can quantify the number of possibilities into bits of entropy,
your code is good. Depending on current technology, this may have to change.
