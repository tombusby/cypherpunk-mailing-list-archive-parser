Uh, I think you probably mean Lance Cottrell, not Hal -- unless Hal's also
written a similar utility with an identical name, about which I haven't heard.

Alex de Joode posted a copy of the usura key edited to reflect the domain name
change to alt.privacy.anon-server. It's presumably on the keyservers....

Oh, and the flame remailer passed away with the closure of the jpunix remailer,
as far as I can tell. (I vaguely recall something to the effect that sinet.org
is/was registered as a subdomain of jpunix.com, but I might well be wrong.)

Hope this helps.
