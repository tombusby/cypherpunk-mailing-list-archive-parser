Presumeably the (tower.stc.housing.washington.edu) comes from a PTR DNS 
lookup. What happens if the IP address of the remailer isn't available from 
DNS, or the in-addr.arpa entry is wrong?  (I don't know who exactly is 
responsible for the in-addr.arpa entry--is it the same as for the others?)
