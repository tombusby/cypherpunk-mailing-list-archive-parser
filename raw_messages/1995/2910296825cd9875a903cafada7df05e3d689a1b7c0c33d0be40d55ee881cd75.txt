Of course it was Chaum himself in his 1981 paper (which I think is available
from the CP FTP site) who described the duplicate-message attack.  I don't
see that inter-remailing encryption helps much, because the attacker can
still notice that whenever they inject message A, _something_ goes to
Bob.  The real solution, as Chaum pointed out, is that the remailer must
reject duplicate messages, even when separated by days.  Doing this without
keeping a database of all messages ever sent is left as an exercise.

Another aspect worth mentioning is that message splitting can make the
kinds of statistical correlations that Wei Dai was looking at more of
a danger.  It's one thing if I send a message along with thousands of
other people, and Bob gets a message along with everyone else.  But if I
send 10 messages and Bob gets 10 from that batch, that fact alone can
help to link us up.  So splitting my big message into 10 standard ones
isn't that great if they're all sent at once.  Ideally you'd want to
dribble them out at some standard rate, a rate at which you always send
a message whether you have something to send or not.  But this may introduce
unacceptable latency.
