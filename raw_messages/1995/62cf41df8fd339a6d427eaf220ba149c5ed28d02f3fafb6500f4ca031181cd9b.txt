Yes, and I believe that it has also been made pretty clear that you
have a snowball's chance in hell of getting SKIP to be a first class
standard.

Anything can be part of the IPSEC working group if it insists, you
know. Anyone can publish an RFC, too.

Other people are substantially more diplomatic than me.

No, I think that SKIP is pretty clearly headed, at best, to
elective. It isn't ever going to be a standard, period.

Think what you like.

Actually, Ran pretty much explicitly said in Danvers that we were
headed towards Photuris and Photuris-like protocols. I know he's a bit
more diplomatic about how he says such things, but again, I think that
the situation is fairly clear, no matter what you guys choose to tell
the trade press.
