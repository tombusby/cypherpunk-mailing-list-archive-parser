For reference, here is that old message with an algorithm that produces an
encrypted session key with a flat distribution over a specified number of
bytes, along with a proof that it works.  The purpose of this is you
could strip off the PGP header stuff and have a file which looked for all
intents and purposes like totally random bytes, but if you knew the
secret key then you could decrypt it just fine.

(I recently took my CP archives and indexed them using Mark Zimmermann's
(no relation to Phil, apparently) FreeText browser which lets me do
keyword searches.  Pretty nice.)
