That's Science Applications ...  An employee owned systems integrator. 
They are one of the largest systems integrators in the world, 2nd largest
to the US government (last time I looked).

Interesting summary, but you forgot to note that what really happened
was that SAIC made some bookkeeping errors, noticed them in a
self-audit, and reported themselves to the government.  Unlike some
companies that try to cover these things up, SAIC found the problems
themselves and didn't cover them up.

SAIC is also one of the largest companies in the information security
field, with over 500 active info-sec contracts at any given time.  They
work for industry as well as government in info-sec, systems
integration, and outsourcing.  For example, they currently do all of the
IT work for BP, handle info-sec for several banks and wall street firms,
have contracts with some of the large players in the entertainment business,
and sponsored the last Americas cup entry from the US.

The real ex-spooks aren't that heavily embedded in SAIC.  The company
was started by a well known physicist who is still the CEO and chairman,
and they do a lot of research in preserving the environment, undersea
research, business reengineering, and other things that are not spookish.

Just thought I would present the rest of the story.

By the way, I have been a consultant for them from time to time, and I
have found them to be hard working, intelligent, and highly motivated. 
They do indeed have a lot of very intelligent people working for them,
many of whom used to work in high-level positions for both democratic
and republican administrations, but I don't think you should hold that
against them - after all, if you were a major government contractor,
wouldn't you want to get people who know how the government works?
