>This is a Windows program designed to generate secure charge card

>the use, by the purchaser, of the merchant's public key, for the

>Two paradigms from the commercial word, EDI and email were
>selected for the implementation.  Email operates in a store and
>forward mode that has some security advantages over web or
>network layer security.  That advantage comes directly from the
>fixed nature of the email message itself.  Once it has been
>created and signed by the keyholder, it cannot successfully be
>altered by any other person.  It is also possible for the message
>to be encrypted at the point where it is created.  Hiding the
>contents of the message from anyone other than the intended
>recipient.

>EDI has already achieved a great deal of acceptance in the

>merchant that is currently using X12 structures should be able to
>purchase a single user ViaCrypt PGP license and be in business
>accepting secure credit card orders over the internet.
>
>PGCHARGE does not add any security features by itself, but rather
>facilitates security by building an EDI transaction for a
>recipient selected from a PGP public keyring.  This information
>is then passed to PGP to be secured.  PGCHARGE then waits for PGP
>to complete, adds the appropriate email headers and invokes a
