folks,  the problem is this:  the cypherpunks mailing list is read as a 
newsgroup on nyx.cs.du.edu.  it seems they must have messed up their 
config recently otherwise we would have been seeing this for more than a 
year.  anyway, i wrote the sysadmin at nyx.cs.du.edu (aburt@nyx...) so 
hopefully this will be taken care of soon.
