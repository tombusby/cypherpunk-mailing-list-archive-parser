  I'm aiming towards anonymous from everyone. The vendor, and the bank.

  I guess I'm being a little too unrealistic about my wishes. In my 
ideal case the IRS and the government would have nothing to do with the 
bank. Fake SS# is a good idea, but noone seems to know exactly how legal 
this is. They could, for example, claim that you were trying to defraud 
the bank and/or the IRS.

  I hadn't heard of this. Its been a couple of years since I've had a 
VISA card.

  That's why I suggested the blank card(no embossing). Without that it 
makes it more diffcult to get your card number. I envision a transaction 
like so:

  1. Card is swiped and the database is checked for your card # and 
enough balance for the purchase.
  
  2. If authorized, a receipt is printed without card #.

  To get your card # the criminal has to either intercept the transaction 
with the database(not too hard), or comprimise the database itself.

  As long as you keep your card physicly secure you should be reasonably 
secure.
