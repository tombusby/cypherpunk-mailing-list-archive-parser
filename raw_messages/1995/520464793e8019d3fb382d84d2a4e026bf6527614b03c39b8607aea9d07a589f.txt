Jim Bidzos is a US Permanent Resident Alien and Greek citizen.  He has a
Green Card.  It doesn't have any ITAR impact, since the ITAR term 'Foreign
Person' doesn't include Green Carded Resident Aliens.

It probably wouldn't have any impact anyway, since he's a business weenie,
and not a software weenie.  Now, if he had a _programmer_ that wasn't a US
Citizen, that would be a-whole-nother kettle of fish.

He's previously stated that he would become a US Citizen, if it were not for
the fact that Greece would require him to give up his Greek (and hence his
EC) citizenship.  See Simson Garfinkle's book on PGP for more details.
