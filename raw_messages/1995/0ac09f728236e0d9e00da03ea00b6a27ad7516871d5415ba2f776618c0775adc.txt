Obviously if the payer is the one transmitting the message, she doesn't
use her public key to encrypt; hers would be used for signature if appropriate.
She should use the payee's public key, or some negotiated key like DH.
It doesn't lose any privacy, because she already knows an address to send
the money to, and the payee can create a public key for that address,
or some other public key he makes available to payers.

I had assumed that the payment information wasn't encrypted because that's a
separate problem from the basic digicash, and because if the payer wants
to keep the transaction private, she probably also needs to encrypt the
other side
of the transaction - e.g. the request for n widget at $d/widget.
https or other ssl connection, or an encrypted telnet, or encrypted email,
or some other protected mechanism all would seem to be appropriate.
