That's today's method, more or less.  It doesn't address my needs.  The
name you pick for your key may or may not mean anything to me.  It might be
pronounceable, giving it some advantage over a radix-64 string, but it
might also be non-unique, making it worthless as an identifier.

What means something to me is whatever name (or symbol) I assign to the
person behind the key in question.  That's the one in my mind and therefore
the only one of interest to me.  You, however, don't know what's in my
mind.  You don't even know my preferred symbol set.
