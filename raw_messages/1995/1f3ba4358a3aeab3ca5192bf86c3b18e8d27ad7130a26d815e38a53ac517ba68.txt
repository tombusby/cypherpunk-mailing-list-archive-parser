Subject: Over 350 'Munitions T-shirts' Shipped

We have thus far shipped over 350 of the RSA/Perl Munition T-shirts.
Orders are still pouring in. Don't be left out. Order your's today.

Now you can wear a TSHIRT that has been classified as a MUNITION by the
US Goverment. That's right! The US International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (ITAR) makes exporting cyrptographic materials illegal.
ITAR further defines export as providing cryptographic information to a
non-US/Canadian citizen even if you are inside the US at the time.
Providing information is further defined as telling or showing
information to a non-US/Canadian citizen. The Munitions Tshirt has a
Perl implementation of the RSA algorithm (the one used by PGP) printed
on the front along with a bar-code of the same algorithm.

What all the above means is that if you wear the Munitions Tshirt where
a non-US/Canadian citizen can see it, even if it is inside the US, you
have just exported cryptographic material (which is already freely
available outside the US) and have become a criminal in the eyes of the
US Government. Now you too can become an international arms dealer for
the price of a tshirt (US$15.95 - US$19.95, depending on size) and the
guts to wear it.

If you are a non-US/Canadian citizen, you can still own a Munitons
Tshirt by ordering the tshirt from a source that is outside the US. The
email response to a request for info (see next paragraph) includes full
instructions for ordering the tshirt no matter where you live.

For more information on how to own this classic example of civil
disobedience, just send email to dhenson@itsnet.com with the subject of
'SHIRT'. (You don't have to be a US/Canadian citizen to request the
info.) Or, if you have WWW access, just point your Web browser to:

     http://colossus.net/wepinsto/wshome.html

By the way, 25% of the profits from the sale of the tshirt (in the
US/Canada) goes to the PHIL ZIMMERMANN LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to help
defend the author of PGP from harassment and possible prosecution by
the Fedgoons.

And if you get arrested for wearing the Munitions Tshirt, we'll refund
your purchase price.  :-)

Get your Munitions Tshirt now. Who knows how long they'll stay in
production!
