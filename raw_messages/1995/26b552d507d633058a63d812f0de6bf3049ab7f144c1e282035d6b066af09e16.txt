There is a program for DOS called MDx which does both MD4 and MD5, and is
pretty fast, too.  It can be found at:

ftp://oak.oakland.edu/SimTel/msdos/fileutil/xsum11.zip

or

ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/fileutil/xsum11.zip

Or at mirrors of the SimTel or Garbo archives.  I cannot claim to be
unbiased, though -- I wrote it (with a little help from Phil Karn's
fast assembly MD5 translate function!)  xsum 1.1 is freeware.
