Uh, no, this is a standalone Java program (includes interpreter,
language library, etc.)

Applets are treated by a browser in the same way that a GIF is treated
(more or less); the browser may have to grab more memory to take in
a big one, but that memory can be reclaimed when the user moves on to
a new page.

Applets run as a thread within a multi-threaded browser, they don't
have their own processes, etc.
