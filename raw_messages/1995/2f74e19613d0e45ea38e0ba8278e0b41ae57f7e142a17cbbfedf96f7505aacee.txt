Considering the general temperature of this list, I'm amazed that I didn't
get torched over my algorithm.  sigh.  The c-punks are all too busy
debating operating systems to worry about effiency in their remailers.
 
Unless, of course, Hal's "I don't understand" was from the Moore school?
 
Let's try this again.
 
Let 2*x be the target number of bits in the modulous.
 
Let n be a large random number with x+2 digits.
Let n1 be the next multiple of 0x10001.
Let t2 be n1 mod 8, t3 be n1 mod 9, t5 be n1 mod 25, t7 be n1 mod 49.
 
Loop:
For i = 2 to 7
 If n1 = 1 mod i and (n1-1)/i + 1 is not a multiple of {2,3,5,7}
    If (n1-1)/i + 1  is prime.
      {
        Let k = 0's in n1/0x10001.
        If k is in range, save and exit.
      }
    EndIf
 EndIf
Next
n1 += 0x10001;
EndLoop
 
Recall:  x^p = x mod p therefore, x^(p-1) = 1 mod p. So what we need is:
(x^e)^d = x^ed = x^(p-1)*i+1 = x mod p.  
 
ie: ed = (p-1)*i+1
or: (ed - 1) / i + 1 = p
 
Now 0x10001 inverts easily, it is just n1/0x10001.  By keeping track of
various quantities, we can eliminate all multiprecision divisions except
for the original one needed to get n1 and the t's, and doing increments
instead.

I don't either, but if >80% of the digits were 0, I'ld probably start to
get nervous.  But I don't need a fast-key for my home system, I'm barely
handing 10 signatures a day.  I only advocate using high 0's when you are
in a high usage environment.
