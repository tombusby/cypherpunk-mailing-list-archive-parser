I found it very easy to use and very well designed. My only complaint
was that it prints out a * every time you enter a character of your
passphrase. Other than that, it's a very good product. Too bad 
Wollersheim didn't have it for his client list...

Unfortunately, I switched to linux shortly afterwards. I have yet to
get CFS compiled. (Oh, Matt, by the way, is that README.linux supposed
to be current, because it's a little...errr...cryptic.) For those
of you who would like to see CFS, the unix encryption system, some
dastardly felon exported it and it's on utopia.hacktic.nl. (I did a diff 
against it with my copy, by the way, and it _hasn't_ been tampered with)
