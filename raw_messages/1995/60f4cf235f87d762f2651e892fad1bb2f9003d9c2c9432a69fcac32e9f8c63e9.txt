 The entity calling itself "Timothy C. May" <tcmay@got.net> is alleged to
 have written:

Ah, but what we are concerned with is whether "Carl Ellison the Key" is
*really* the same "Carl Ellison the Key" that you think he is.  :-)  Or
to put it another way, that *he* thinks he is the same "C.E. the Key" 
that you think he is.

Well and good, Tim, but you *do* care if the entity calling itself "Hal
Finney" is being surrounded by the Man in the Channel ("Mitch") and all 
of your communications with that entity are under Mitch's control.  For
example, you may choose to enter a contract with the entity calling
itself "Hal Finney", and provide some sort of consulting service to it
in exchange for 10,000 cyberbucks.  If Mitch is actually in control
then he could easily steal both the output of your consultation *and* 
Hal's 10,000 cyberbucks and leave the two of you hating each other.


Perhaps by "persistent key-holding" you mean to imply "without being
spoofed by Mitch", in which case I'm sure that you agree on the
importance of anti-Mitch measures.  :-)
