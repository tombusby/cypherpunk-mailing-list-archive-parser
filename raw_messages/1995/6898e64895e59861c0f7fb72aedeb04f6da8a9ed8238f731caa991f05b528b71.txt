I suspect I'm not the only one getting weary of going around and around on
this issue, so I'll confine my response to just one point:

Nope. au contraire, negatory. I *do not* care if the entity calling itself
"Hal Finney" is being surrounded by an MITM. Only "Hal Finney the Key" can
read messages I encrypt to the public key I got from him long ago, so if
the "Hal + MITM" can do so, they are effectively one and the same.

(Not really, in some other senses, but far beyond anything simple crypto
can handle.)
