Heh, hey Alice, you know this discussion a short time ago where you
claimed that you wouldn't use PGP for signing because it wasn't secure
or something, what's with the use of the penet address?

Surely a penet address offers even less protection for your id?

Or have you done something nifty like create the penet address with a
nymserver address?

(the real)

Alice de 'nonymous ...

                                  ...just another one of those...
