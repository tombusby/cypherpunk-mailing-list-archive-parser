Then there are the e-systems like companies, operating in the U.S., often 
conducting operations under the guise of corporations yet ducking below 
the umbrella of "classified information" at the first sign of a suit.  
Yet, the employees walk about armed and turn up with bugging equipment in 
drug trafficker's neighborhoods.  e-systems is just the latest to be 
under public scrutiny.

Is it any wonder the government has begun to lean heavily on corporations 
where traditional institutional secrecy has been circumvented by FOIA and 
such?

Hell, e-systems is publically traded, dekalg has been talking about 
initial public offerings for months.

There is perhaps more protection in the corporation of former 
intelligence types than in any agency.

I commented before that NRO and NSA were public relations savvy now because 
most of the deeply hidden projects had found their way elsewhere.
