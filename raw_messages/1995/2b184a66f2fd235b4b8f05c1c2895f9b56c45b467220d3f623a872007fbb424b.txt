1.  Sez who?


2.  We are discussing the feasibility of using DigiCash currency for illegal
money laundering.  We have to assume (ceteris paribus) that the would-be
launderers are still capable of the same tricks that they are currently
capable of, which, apparently, includes access to anonymous bank accounts.

If you do it via his one-time bank account then you can only reveal to which
one-time anonymous account you transferred the money-- no more.


Even if you and your beneficiary don't have this option, the transaction
is still much safer and more convenient if done via DigiCash than via any 
other current currency.  Criminals and conspirators live with the everpresent
problem of betrayal, and this "one step, one way, requires the cooperation of
the payer" traceability seems to me to be a small hassle on the way to a big
win for such people.

Crytographically (and in the limit, legally) meaningless, right?  I could
edit my log right now to say I gave you a thousand cyberbucks in return for
an illegal copy of some information, but no-one would care.



I appreciate your correspondance.
