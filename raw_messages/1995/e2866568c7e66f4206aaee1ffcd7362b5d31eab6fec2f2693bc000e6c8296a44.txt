I agree with this analysis. When key escrow was being debate in the summer
of '94 here, I called this criterion the basis for a "strongly voluntary"
system. Specifically, that one could have the bit bucket as an "escrow
agent," with of course no retrieval by the government. Or one's lawyer, or
one's spouse, or an offshore bank, and so on.

All of these are "voluntary" key escrow (though I hate that misuse of the
word "escrow") systems. None of them involve government certification, and
there are few circumstances where I think "government certification" is
even useful, let alone necessary.

Any scheme in which the government interjects itself in what would not
normally involve them can hardly be said to be strictly voluntary.
