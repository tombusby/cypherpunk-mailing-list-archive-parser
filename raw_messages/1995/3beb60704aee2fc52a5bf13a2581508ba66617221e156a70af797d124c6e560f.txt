I checked out alt.locksmithing, based on some commentary I saw over in 
alt.current-events.net-abuse, and to be perfectly honest, there isn't really 
all that much going on along these lines, certainly nothing on the order of 
magnitude of the alt.religion.scientology crap.  One or two soreheads, but 
by net.standards they don't even really qualify as significant flamers, and 
a few (apparently) professional locksmiths who are talking about things in a 
rather friendly fashion.
