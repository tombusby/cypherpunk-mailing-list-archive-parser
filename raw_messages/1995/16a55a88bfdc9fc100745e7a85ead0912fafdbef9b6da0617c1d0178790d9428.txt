These guys at Netmanage's support seem to confuse Trumpet's version number
with the Winsock version... Trumpet 2.0b (as, AFAIK, any other Winsock
package presently available) is Winsock 1.1 compliant. 

By the way, I read in the "about/more" screen of Websurfer 4.6 (that 
works with my Win95 TCP/IP stack):

and on the right side of the URL field a little (open) lock icon is shown. 
However, I haven't found anywhere references to secure connections. Does 
anybody know more about it? For sure, "https:" URL are not recognized.
