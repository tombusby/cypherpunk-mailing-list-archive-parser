Has anyone checked into the software package "CryptDisk" for the 
Macintosh?  It seems to be the Macintosh compliment to SecureDrive, but 
one must register and drop an extra $20 for the source code.

I don't want to get into the issue of copyright and such, only the 
question of how much public scrutiny the source code for this application 
has seen.

Anyone taken a peek?
