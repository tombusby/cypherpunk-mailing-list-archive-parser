I don't think that the  Interceptor is going to be much use with 
spread spectrum reception.  Unless you are really, really close to your 
target other non-ss signals are going to be much stronger.  

The freq range of the device is 30MHz-2GHz.  It is also legal to sell 
even though it is great at picking up the cellular phone 
conversations in the car you are tailing. There is also the plausible 
deniability in a device like this because you don't know what 
frequency you are listening to so you don't know if it is one of 
those "illegal ones".

A directional antenna isn't much use with a device like this because
it will pick up many other stronger signals that will overwhelm your
target transmission.  I am speaking of suburban or urban areas here.
This may work if you are in a rural region where there are no cell
towers, braodcast towers, or repeaters in use.

The Scout is a just frequency counter so you must have a scanner or
the Interceptor  to actually listen in.
