Just what this world needs -- more vigilantees. To my mind, they are the
moral equivalent of the right wing militia groups.

A technical point: The piece would have the people who are not computer
literate believe that GIF and JPG are code words for porn pictures and are
used only in that context. The truth is they are merely computer filename
extensions used for two different graphical data formats. You will also find
GIF and JPG formatted images used on the Whitehouse WWW page, the Library of
Congress' THOMAS, and the WWW page for the Pope's visit to Baltimore - not to
mention the WWW page I just created for a customer selling polluted water
filtration systems.

I have never in my 62 years witnessed any news story on any subject about
which I had any personal knowledge or expertise that did not contain factual
errors. Is it any wonder that people are increasingly skeptical of the news
media?
