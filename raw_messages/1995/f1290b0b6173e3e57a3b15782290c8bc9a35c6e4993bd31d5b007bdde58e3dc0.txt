Hello Everyone,

	I just discovered earlier this morning that in transitioning to a 
newer version of the FreeBSD OS, the majordomo code that runs the mix-l 
mailing list had become slightly broken. I'm not sure if subscription 
requests were being processed correctly. The list is fixed now. If you 
have tried to subscribe to mix-l in the past and have gotten no response, 
please try again.

send email to majordomo@jpunix.com with the BODY (not subject) of the 
message being:

subscribe mix-l

if you are interested in knowing about the goings-on with the development 
and operation of the Mixmaster remailer code.
