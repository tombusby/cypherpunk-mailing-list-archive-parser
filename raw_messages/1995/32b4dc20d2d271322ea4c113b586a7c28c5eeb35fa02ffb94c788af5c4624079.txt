first note that in carol ann's post she previously said it doesn't matter 
to her how the data is transported, and thus it could be in paintext, I 
made.  and also that she said that the operator should be able to specify 
how it was transmitted.

once again we're running with different definitions of data haven.  I see 
the ata haven as more than just aplace to safely store data if it's 
encrypted, I see it capabel of alot of other things, like acting as a 
central point to  BlackNet type operation, with the proper structure set 
up to carry out the transactions with safety, or relative safety.  also, 
as a anonymous drop box type of place, I can then send my encrypted data 
to the data haven, and let them hold it until some anonymous client or 
eployer and I complete an agreed upon contract and both give word to the 
data haven to complete it's aprt of the contract, wether it is allowing 
the other person to now access that encrypted information, or doing a 
monetary transaction with net-cash or whatever.  Also, as a data base of 
illegl information, like old credit records and such.

agreed. there are also other operations besides data storage that can be 
protected by your own crypto, and only use the data haven as a mid-point.

argh, I'm sorry fo the poor typing in this letter, and the other one i 
sent to Eric ont his subject, it's really late and I am dogged, just got 
done 9 hours of work.  BUt this topic is so interesting for me I couldnt 
resist.  Tommorow if I get a chance I will atttempt to outline what *I* 
think of when I am saying data haven, maybe it will help us be more 
productive, not that we arent doing that now...
