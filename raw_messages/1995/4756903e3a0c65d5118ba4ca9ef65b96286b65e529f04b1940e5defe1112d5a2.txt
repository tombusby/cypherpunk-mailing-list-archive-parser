It almost did when InterNIC announced it's recent (and abrupt) new pricing
structure for domain names. All it would take is an additional entry in
{dns}/root.cache - even a small company with decent VC (and multiple
geographic locations, preferably) could have pulled this off and made a
decent chunk of change underselling InterNIC; with a slight shift in the way
things are done, the model could have been opened up into a competitive
market with price and (GASP!) customer service/response time wars. [FADE IN:
Look, Jim! I submitted my domain through Campbell.NET 30 seconds ago and
it's already live .. That's nothing, Terry, ...]

Yet another 'axiom' that turns out to be nothing more than convention.
