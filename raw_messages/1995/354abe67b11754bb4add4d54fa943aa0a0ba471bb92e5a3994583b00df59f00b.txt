I would like it if the person who is working ont eh datahaven code would 
give us soem more information, like what it does, what are the plans for 
it etc..  DataHaven is a vague word.

Blacknet is going on right now, only none of uf are involved in it, not 
to say I'm so k-rad and kool that i am underground and involved in it, 
but eh anonymous market is alive today, JUST that it isn't bieng studied, 
like one such as BlackNet concievably owuld have been. There are 
definetly people making anon. transactions out there.

I was refering to the finished, established project, and not the 
experiment/study level.

Sterling's _Islands In The Net_ is a must read for this topic matter.  
In this book, the DataHaven operators maintain security thru the data 
they horde, by hoding it over poeples heads, and also by just plain 
technical savvy(ala action thrillers hehe)

I would like to help get them off the ground, by either providing help 
with code, policy, or just another head in teh game.  They are a techno 
fetish of mine, I mean I'm even nymed after one, Nesta Stubbs, from 
_Islands In The Net_
