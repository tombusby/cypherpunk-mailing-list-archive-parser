Hi.

I'm writing a replacement for brloop/brclient in perl, one with full
SKSP compatibiliy, and one which is easily extensible and more
straightforward than the original br* code...

What would be some useful features to include in the code?  I'm
attempting to make it more friendly, more "intelligent", etc -- the
whole shebang.  It would be reasonably easy to, as someone here
suggested, have the program start the keyfetch process before the last
key segment finished, or whatever -- the question is, is that worth
it?  I'm also including code to make it possible for the user to
specify how much time she wants to give the search, etc...  It should
be possible to include code for a very simple sort of farming setup
(at least something to allow easy remote launches of the brute code)..

Would all this be useful to other people?  What features would make it
more so?

Also, it seems that there have been some "extensions" to the SKSP
protocol...  For instance, suddenly there are different machines
dedicated just to ACKs, etc.  Is there a central repository of these
changes?  (Have these changes even been publicly reviewed?)

(the program, in case you couldn't deduce it from the title of this
message is to be "yabc" - yet another brute* client.  oh how so clever
and original, no?)
