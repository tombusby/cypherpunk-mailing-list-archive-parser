Sorry, I wasn't perfectly clear.  Of course, RSA is not based on
Diffie-Hellman specifically; what I mean is that all public-key work is
based on that general paper, which "invented" public-key cryptography.  I
think this very confusion may be plaguing the writer of the aforementioned
article.

It was my impression that DH had a further weakness not related to the
difficulty of the hard problem.  As my copy of Schneider is at home, I must
defer to ignorance at this point.
