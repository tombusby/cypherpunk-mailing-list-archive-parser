Cypherpunks, as they say, write code.

It doesn't really matter very much what platform cypherpunks write
code for, as long as we actually write code.  Progress comes from
getting stuff done and making results available so that others can
expand on it and use it, not from sitting around optimizing what
should be done (by others, of course) in the future.  (Ever notice
how, every time this comes up, the question is always something
like "why aren't people writing more software for platform X?" and
never "I want to write some software - does anyone have any
suggestions on which platform would have the most impact?")

Every minute spent arguing about whether Unix, DOS, Macs or VIC-20s
constitute the optimal platform for writing and deploying crypto
software is a minute during which no crypto code is being written
or deployed for Unix, DOS, Macs, or VIC-20s.

Just write code.  For whatever platform you like writing code for.
