Because then the last, unstoppable act of the State will be to clamp
down on anonymous agents.

See "How to Boil Live Frogs". You can't dump them into boiling water
because they will jump out. Instead, start at a comfortable temperature
and turn up the heat a little bit at a time. Eventually, the frogs become
unable to escape and are lulled to their unconscious death. I equate "making 
some aspects 'illegal'" with increasing the water temperature. 

To paraphrase and oft-seen .sig from this list:

"Seldom is freedom of any kind lost all at once."
