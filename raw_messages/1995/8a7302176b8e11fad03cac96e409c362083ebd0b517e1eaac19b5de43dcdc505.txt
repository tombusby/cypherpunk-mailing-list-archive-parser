Reasons this won't work:

1. The Real Reason: It's terminally cute, and terminally cute arguments
rarely stand up in court.

2. The Technical Reason: As I recollect, it is unproven that "any sequence
of digits will appear in pi someplace." (It may be expected that any finite
sequence will eventually appear, but I'm unaware of any proof, and I have
reason to suspect such a proof might be impossible.). A wise-ass judge--not
that any court in the rational (or irrational) world would ever deal with
this--could demand proof.

3. The Legalistic Reason: The "key registration" law would likely be
phrased in terms of direct opening of messages, not existential trickery
about "the set of all keys."

I urge that we deal with key registration on more plausible bases than
trickery and sophistry.

(How may keys can dance on the head of a PIN, and all.)
