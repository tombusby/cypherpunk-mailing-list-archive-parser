We talked about this at dinner - what kind of proposals can industry offer, 
other than "128 bits and honest escrow" or "64 bits and no escrow"?
"128 bits now, with no escrow if you want any campaign contributions this fall"
or simply "get stuffed, we're all buying our crypto from Europe and including
it in all our products" ?

According to one of the newspaper articles, the gang of 37 is a Jerry Berman/CDT
coordination, so I don't expect one of the more radical answers from them,
but maybe they'll do the right thing.  The fact that Netscape is including
secure email in their Navigator next release can be a big lever pushing the
Feds toward giving up, and perhaps deserves some publicity once the 
release version is out the door.
