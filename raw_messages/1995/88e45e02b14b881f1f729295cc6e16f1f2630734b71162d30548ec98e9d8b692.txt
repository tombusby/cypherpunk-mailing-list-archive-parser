If it's up nearly all the time (23.8 hours a day), accepting mail,
then I see no reason your machine can't be a remailer. If, however, it
gets turned off, taken home for the holidays, isn't always in a state
to accept mail, then your remailer will get pinged and downchecked by
the testing programs. 

(And you won't easily be able to arrange for multple "accounts" on the
machine, given the sorry state of such things on the Mac.)

Others may know more about this means for running a remailer on a Mac.
I do know that Scott Collins, a Mac programming wizard who works for
Apple, chose to run his remailer on Netcom's Unix machines...he would
be a person to ask about what you hope to do.

I can't help here. Try the Perl discusssion groups...there's probably
a FAQ on both Perl and MacPerl that discusses incompatibilities and issues.

As an aside, maybe working on another project, one that is actually
new territory, would be a more interesting and useful thing to do.
With a 660AV, and the various audio tools available, a Mac version of
PGP Phone might be a lot more interesting.
