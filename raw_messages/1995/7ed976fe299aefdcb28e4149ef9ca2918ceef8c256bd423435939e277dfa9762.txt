four line C source?  I'm impressed.  I've enclosed a bit longer C-source 
that does the same.

/*This was written to deal with trumpet winsock's 'encryption' by
  spitting out the ppp-username and ppp-password values.

  This was written by: Ben Samman <samman@cs.yale.edu>.

  The algorithm is very simple and a simple inspection of this file should
  be sufficient for most people to figure out whats going on.

  Feel free to copy this as you please, as long as you include this
  message with it.

  If you use this, please send me mail and tell me what its used
  for--I'd be somwhat curious.

  If there are any questions, feel free to mail me and ask me.

  USAGE:
  trmpbrk <base> <pass>

  Definitions:

  BASE:
  Base is a trumpwsk.ini file in which you have inputted "000000000000" into
  the ppp-username box in the File/PPP Options/Username menu in Trumpet
  Winsock.  Don't forget to rename this to something other than
  trumpwsk.ini(something like "0")

  I've included my copy of base, but every version/revision of
  Trumpet Winsock changes it, so I would recommend you do this yourself.

  PASS:
  This is the file that you want to decrypt the value for.  Most of the time
  it will be trumpwsk.ini.

  Example:

  trmpbrk 0 trumpwsk.ini
