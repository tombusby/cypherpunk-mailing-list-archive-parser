A nine digit number, 999,999,999 can be stored as 0x3b9ac9ff. Note that this is
eight 4bit hex digits, or 32 bits, except the top nibble only has two bits
used, or its 30 bits.

Nah, I suggested they reformat into 80 columns and suggested a different title
for this section, but they went with it.  They wanted it fer sure.  I just don't
know what it means.

Someone else on this list mentioned that an edge detection algorithm would help 
here.  You wouldn't have to try to detect letters if there were no edges.
It could give you a quick go/no go.

They mean that if you don't feel secure with theirs, you could use yours in
their framework...it's the pluggable encryption that NSA has had such a hard
time with but seems to be in favor of now.
