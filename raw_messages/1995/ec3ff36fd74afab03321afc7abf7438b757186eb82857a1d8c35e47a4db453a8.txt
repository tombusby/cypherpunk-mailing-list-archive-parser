I think the centralization/decentralization confusion comes from PGP's
decentralized approach to key generation and authentication, which has
been hailed as a good thing. As long as folks can generate their own
keys, sign their friends' keys, and upload their keys to servers at 
their own discretion, I can't see what would make a centralized or
standardized distribution method harmful.
