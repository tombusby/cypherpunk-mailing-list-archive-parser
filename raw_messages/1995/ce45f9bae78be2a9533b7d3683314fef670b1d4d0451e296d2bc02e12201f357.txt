I know.. I blush. I've become such a netjunkie that not being able to find
any of the answers on web pages, or Cypherpunk logs I just panicked.

Thank you everyone who sent me a message with the reference.

(Btw... what would be the absolute coolest thing folk would like to see
added to RSAREF? That is, other than code that we will need to negotiate
for. What new thing, speed upgrade, enhancement, etc would just tickle?)
