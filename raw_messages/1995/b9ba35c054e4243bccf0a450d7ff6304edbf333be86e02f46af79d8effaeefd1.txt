There must be several versions of the code at this point.  The
Cypherpunks release, Damien's release and whoever else wrote some code
to do the chore.  If someone could pass me a pointer to the version
that's best-commented and most understandable (one man's C is another
man's crypto) I'd like to port it to Windows NT and write a simple
installation to install it as a service.
	Perhaps a general-purpose OO bruteforcing library (addition to
Crypto++?) would be a good idea.  Just pass a pointers to the
encrypt() and decrypt() functions to use for this session to the
Cracker object, which in turn takes a number of bits and starts
cracking.:)
	The problem with this is the disparity among out-of-the-box encrypt
and decrypt functions.  But I suppose it's nothing that couldn't be
overcome with wrapper functions.  Just thinking out loud. :)
