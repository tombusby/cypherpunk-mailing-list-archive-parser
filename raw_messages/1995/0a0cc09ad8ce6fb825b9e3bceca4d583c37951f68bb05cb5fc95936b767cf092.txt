Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I wasn't aware of any cracking
program for Stuffit archives. If you know of any others, please let me
know.

I just finished trying this one, though. It doesn't work.

Here's a some background on Stuffit archives:
There have been three different formats for Stuffit files over the past 8
(has it really been 8?) years.

1)   Version 1.5.1. The original
2)   Version 2.0    Short lived. No longer used.
3)   Version 3.0    The Current version. First shipped in 1992 (I think)

The crack described at the above URL does not work for 1.5.1 archives.
It also does not work for 3.0 archives.
I don't have any 2.0 archives handy, but I will test them in the morning.

It is possible that the cracking technique described at the above URL will
work for 2.0 archives. However, none of Aladdin's shipping software will
generate 2.0 archives, and Aladdin supplies a (free) converter from 1.5.1
and 2.0 archives to 3.0 archives. (They get smaller when converted, too!)
