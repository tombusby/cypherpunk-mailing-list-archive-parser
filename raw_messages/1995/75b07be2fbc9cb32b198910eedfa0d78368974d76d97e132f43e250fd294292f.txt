Thanks, Daniel, for a thoughtful response.

I didn't mean to suggest that government would be responsible to get it right.
It is possible to show them how it's done though.

This is good as it can be pitched as economic development. Any good models?
Where to find the UTAH language? Pitfalls to watch out for?

This will probably be tough in the current environment. Again, any good
language available? Fortunately Vermont is small enough where anyone can get
a bill printed and introduced if it is properly drafted.

What did the recent US Supreme court decide in support of anonymity?

Now were getting specific. These are things that us ordinary folk can do
which show the 'leaders' how to follow. What software, hardware,
applications, support and sysadmin experience is required and where is it
available on what terms. What are the cash flow opportunities to support
such services?

Agreed. That why after five or six years of trying to get the privacy laws
passed, and watching government drag anchor, I started fishin the
cypherpunks list for some pragmatic solutions to everyday situations.

I'd still like to be pointed to some toolkits/reference works which will
teach me how to access and use available information (or data) to map the
net performance, message paths, transmission delay times, sniffers active, etc.
