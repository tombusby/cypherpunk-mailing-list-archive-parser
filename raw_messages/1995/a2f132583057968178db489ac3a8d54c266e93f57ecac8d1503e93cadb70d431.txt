In comp.infosystems.www.browsers.x Jamie Zawinski <jwz@netscape.com>
said that there *will* be a 2.0 version for Linux.  He also explained
why Linux isn't listed and why Netscape will tell you that there
will not be a supported version of Netscape for Linux.
This is a copy of that article, which is worth reposting here, I think,
because of the large threads about this subjects:

Since then, it would seem that some folks have called our customer
support lines and gotten a seemingly different answer, so allow me to
clarify:

When someone in customer support tells you "we will not be supporting
Linux in Netscape 2.0," they're right: but that's because we didn't
support it in 1.0 or 1.1 either.  "Support" means we sell the software,
and you can buy a support contract.  This is not, and has never been the
case for Linux.  You have never been able to get a *supported* version
of Netscape Navigator for Linux.  We have no Linux *product*; our sales
and support folks don't deal with it in any way, and never have.

However, there has been an unsupported educational/evaluation version
available for that platform, and this will also be the case for 2.0.
