I have received the following information about running SecureDrive
1.4 with Win95, thanks to Ed Stone,

    This is what I sent to a person who asked how to use secdrive on
    win95......

    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>inserted text follows
    Try this:

    in your autoexec.bat file enter this, using your path to secdrive:

    C:\your-path-to-secdrive\SECTSR
    C:\your-path-to-secdrive\LOGIN your-encrypted-disk-letter: /S
    C:\your-path-to-secdrive\login your-encrypted-disk-letter:

    During normal win95 startup, you will be asked to enter your
    passphrase. Now when 95 come up, the tsr is running, your passphrase
    has been entered, and everything operates as if the disk is not
    encrypted. EXCEPT.... the tsr you have loaded (sectsr) makes windows
    load real-mode drivers for the disk, instead of protected mode
    drivers. This will make disk access somewhat slower, but not a big
    deal. When you startup win95 and you don't need to use secdrive,
    just hit enter when the boot process asks for your passphrase, and
    it will behave as if you entered a "wrong passphrase" and that drive
    will not be visible to win95, and protected mode drivers will
    load...

    Hope this helps.

In particular that the normal drivers will load even with sectsr
resident if the correct passphrase isn't entered is new and valuable
information.

I have also just learned that SecureDrive 1.4 is now available on some
non-USA (and so not export-controlled) ftp sites,

    ftp://utopia.hacktic.nl/pub/disk/secdr14.zip
    ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/misc/secdr14.zip

I have verified that the hacktic file is an exact copy of the zip I
released in the USA.
