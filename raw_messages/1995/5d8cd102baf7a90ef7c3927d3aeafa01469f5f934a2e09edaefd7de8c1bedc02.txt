Yeah, there's RIPEM-SIG, which is approved for export so you can even give it
to your non-Yankee students, and it's compatible with the RIPEM secure email
stuff.
So your US students, and anyone else who wants to download the software from
England, can send secure email, and everybody can check the signatures.
I'm not sure if RIPEM-SIG has caught up with the features in the latest
versions of RIPEM, which include an X.509 variant on Web of Trust.

Somebody else has brought up the insecurity of using security software
on multi-user machines, where the system administrator or anybody who cracks
root can steal your passphrases and even replace the trustable software with
trojan-horse versions; your students will be safer if they only trust stuff
running on PCs from software they've verified themselves.  But you can at least
do signature-checking safely on a multi-user machine if the software is
protected adequately.
