1400 EDT=1800 GMT.  This is because GMT=\BST.  GMT always stays the same and
does not become British Summer Time (or whatever it is Brussels is making
the UK call its time zone these days).

Another general problem though is that Monday is August Bank Holiday in the
UK.  That might further delay UK office-based result reporting.  Start
day-of-the-week should be something like Tuesday.
