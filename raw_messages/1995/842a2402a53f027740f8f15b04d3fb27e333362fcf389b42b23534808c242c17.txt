The difference between my response to your question and your responses
to my questions is that I tried to answer your questions.

I don't see wher I said anything about formal specification here or Z-specs.
It's true that proof of correctness for large systems is a hard problem, and
that is one of the reasons that the secure http daemon is designed to be small.
However, the same has not been shown (as far as I am aware) for many of the
other properties that may be interesting from a security standpoint.

Problems worthy of attack, prove their worth by fighting back - Alan Perlis

I never said it was and he is not my grad student.  He is a grad student
who made some comments on the daemons and decided he would be interested
in seeing if some of these properties could be proven.

And I told you that we are in the process of, but not finished with, doing
just that.  I never said that any such problems reside solely in PGP.

If you are tired of hearing my responses to your comments, there is an
obvious solution.
