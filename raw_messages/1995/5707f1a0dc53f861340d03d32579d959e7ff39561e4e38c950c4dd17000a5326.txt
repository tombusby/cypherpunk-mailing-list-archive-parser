For those of the anonymous pay-me-in-(digitial/physical)-cash only 
underground types, yes.

Speculation of course.  No better, or closer to the truth either one way 
or the other?  (Any of you anons work for the mob?  if so, is the mob 
'puter-happy?)

Two logical possibilities.

  0. Mobsters still get caught and thrown in jail.
  1. They don't use crypto at all.  All records are in the open and 
searchable.  LEA's wet dream.
  2. They use strong crypto and can't be caught at all.  LEA's nightmare.
  3. They use crypto, but are still catchable (oops, the secret is out of 
the bag now, cancel all the computer related RICO nonsense.)
  4. They don't use crypto, but keep no records, or hide them well.  They 
can still be caught by LEA's.

  3 & 4 are the most likely, and the LEA's shameful little secret.  They 
cry wolf to set a wolf trap, but meanwhile they're hunting wabbits, not 
wolves.

Errmm.. precisely the reason to stay away from them.  While the first few 
parts of your above paragraph are quite tempting, the last sentence is 
deadly.  You can't quit from your "family" without cement shoes.  So I'll 
stay away from that line of ...um... work.
