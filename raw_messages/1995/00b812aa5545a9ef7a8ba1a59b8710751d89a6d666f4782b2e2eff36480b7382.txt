        This might be relevant. This is a page from the NCCOSC web site
<http://www.nosc.mil>

        The Naval Command, Control  & Ocean Surveillance Center (NCCOSC) is
the U.S. Navy's warfare center for command, control and communication
systems and ocean surveillance and the integration of those systems which
overarch multiplatforms. NCCOSC is based in San Diego, CA.

        NCCOSC Command Internet (NCI) is part of NCCOSC, of course -- and
NCCOsc is part of SpaWar (Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command.)  Clear?

        Note that NCCOSC recently decided to beef up NCI's user
authentication.  See "Current Initiatives."
