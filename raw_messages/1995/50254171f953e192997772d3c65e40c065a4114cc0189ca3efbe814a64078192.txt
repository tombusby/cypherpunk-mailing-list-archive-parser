I keep periodically asking this question, but has any progress been made on
making the remailer software compatible with the remailer software found on
Freenets?

The question is even more pertinent now that we seem to be having a problem
maintaining a satisfactory number of remailers operational and reliable. Is
there any consensus as to whether it can be done  or not? I'd give it a shot
using my Cleveland account to see how workable it is (ie, how long it takes
for the Freenet operators to shut it down :>).
