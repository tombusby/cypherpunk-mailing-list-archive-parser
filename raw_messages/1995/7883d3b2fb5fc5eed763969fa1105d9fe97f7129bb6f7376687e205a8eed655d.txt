One interesting (but maybe off-topic) facet of client-side applets (a la
Java) is the fact that publishers can define proprietary protocols and file
formats, and change them as often as they want, giving a sort of minimal
protection against casual duplication and re-publishing. With a bit more
work, the formats could make true transclusions efficient and easy to apply,
and help increase the amount of serious/commercial information available to
the public.

This is nothing new, I suppose... Java (from a user point of view) isn't
that much different than IntelligentPad, which from what I understand was
the client system the Xanadu people were working with recently.
