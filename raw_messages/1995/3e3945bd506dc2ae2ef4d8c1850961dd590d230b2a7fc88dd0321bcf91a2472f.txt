As Hal notes, there are a lot of issues and attacks to consider. I'm sorry
that my brief section on Chaumian digital cash in the Cyphernomicon doesn't
adequately cover the issues (and as the debates here show, confusion still
reigns, and no doubt some of my points are misleading, wrong, or
incomplete).

"Double spending" detection is a REAL MESS. That's my basic conclusion. It
tends to require schemes for going after double spenders, it tends to make
identity-revealing attacks possible (such as the attack I alluded to, and
that Hal more completely describes), and it's INELEGANT.

"Immediate clearing" is much more elegant, and is, I think, truer to the
spirit of "annonymous digital cash" than most of these other schemes are.
(Grep the FAQ for "online" or "online clearing" or "clearing" and you
should find some stuff. Also, several articles--including one recently by
me, about a month ago--go into the differences between the types of
clearing.)
