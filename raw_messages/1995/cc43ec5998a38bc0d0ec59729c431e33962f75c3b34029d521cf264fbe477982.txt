Hear, hear! Michael is correct in pointing out that the "machine-readable"
part has indeed been a criterion...if the ITARs in general are unlikely to
withstand scrutiny, then trying to get books banned would really cause
problems.

Also, one of the criteria I recollect is that "systems" were barred from
export, not just algorithms. Algorithms are very widely discussed, even
described in detail in patents. "Cryptographic systems," embodied in
systems, circuits, and specific programs, are not the same as what gets
published in textbooks.

(BTW, I'm glad I can now read the posts of Michael Shields. His MIME PGP
was admirable, in intent, but many of us (from comments here and that were
sent to me) just can't handle whatever MIME configuration he was previously
using.)
