That of the data haven operator being able to deny knowledge of the
contents of files people send him. He'll only return files that, when
operated on by a strong cryptographic algorithm, make sense. He therefore
can't look inside the files until the owner asks for them back. If he
operates a timely (and automated) service, he can't know the contents until
after he's already sent the file back. If the server automatically deletes
the file upon return, he can't even tell what's in it then.

Further, an "authority" won't gain anything by seizing the data.

As best I can tell, none of the previous suggestions guarantees that the
file is unreadable. How would you accomplish that in a simpler manner? Or
would you, as the operator of a data haven, not mind the risk of somebody
designing an illegal file that passes all your filters and tipping off the
police that you've got such a file on your computer, available to all--for
sale, even?

If there were a weakness in your filter, somebody could easily exploit that
weakness and get the use of your haven. With my system, they could send you
anything they liked, but it'd be little more than a cash donation, as
they'd never get it back. Your liability would be the same as if the person
had just emailed you the file and blew the whistle.
