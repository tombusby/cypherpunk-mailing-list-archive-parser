Because there were two complaints on this, I'd like to find out why.

I'm using a modified version of Elm, Michael Elkins' 2.4PL24ME4 version.
Among other features, this adds integrated PGP support, and uses the
content-type application/pgp for it.

Here is the complete header on the message I sent, as returned:

I think that it must be the content-type that is causing problems, as
the rest of the message is completely standard.  To the people whose
mailers broke out in hives at that message: Do you get the same behavior
with any message having an unknown content-type?
