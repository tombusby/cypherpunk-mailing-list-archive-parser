I stipulated I didn't want any such garbage, I specifically said
english summaries are not acceptable and you bombard me with them.
Yet you wont accept others opinion of PGP's security, which verbal or
other wise, can only be an abstract summary.

piffle! Your words:
	"I think that this issue can generally be addressed by a divide
	and conquer strategy.  Prove that the called routines are
	correct and confined under all possible parameters, do the
	same for the calling routines, do the same for the interaction
	between them, and I think you have it."

This sounds like performing a formal analsis to me.  And you didn't
address the intractability anyway.

The work in automatic theorum proving is ongoing and not limited to
your grad student or your work.

I said showing by english isn't good enough, proving would be
fantastic.  I don't believe these issues reside solely with pgp and as
such you should question computability as a whole before using
"incomplete specification" in accusing one system to be flawed.

Your tiresome repetitive question was "Why do you belive X is secure"
I herby answer exactly as above "I cannot be certain there is no
compromising bugs or backdoors in X"
