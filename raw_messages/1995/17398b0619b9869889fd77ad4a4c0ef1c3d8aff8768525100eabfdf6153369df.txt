As the list's designated "very libertarian" advocate, I must object.
Here is what you must sign to become a member of the Libertarian Party:

"I hereby certify that I do not believe in or advocate the initiation of
force as a means of achieving political or social goals." Libertarian
Pledge required for membership.
       <signature>___________________________.

To "to threten, harass, or generally make a nuicence"[SIC] of himself,
one must violate this pledge, and there would no-doubt still be legal
results. This points up the difference between libertaria (not utopia)
and anarchy. Anything _DOESN'T_ go in libertaria. If you see a victim,
there's almost certainly a crime, and if someone chose to threaten,
harass, etc. me, I would want it so. Of course, there are exceptions.

For example: If I join a mailing list which sometimes "harasses" me
due to insufficient spell-checking/proof-reading of certain posts,
there might still be the common-law defense that Jim Ray "came to the
nuisance," and therefore I am still not due any compensation.<g>
I can always unsubscribe, and some people probably wish I would. ;)
[NOTE: IANAL!]
