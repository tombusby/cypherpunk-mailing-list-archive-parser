  A variation of a bond is an escrow agent....

     Overload Alert: I use "escrow" here in the more mundane sense of
     the folks who collect your real estate taxes and homeowners'
     insurance from you 1/12th at a time along with your mortgage
     payment, for instance.

  If the buyer has a =nonymous= agent to recieve the payment, which is
only released to the seller upon proof(s) of performance (whether in
lump sum or on a schedule of staged payments tied to specific milestones
in a long-term project) then the buyer has someone to go after in the
event of such shenannigans.

  And the escrow method dynamically scales to meet this threat, whereas
the bond is static.

  Of course, the escrow agent will extract his pound of flesh, just as
any other form of insurance. Such is the nature of life.
