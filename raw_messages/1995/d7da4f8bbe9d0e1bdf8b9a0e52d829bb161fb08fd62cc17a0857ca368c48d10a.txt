A common way to get around prostitution sting operations is to ask the lady
to expose sensitive portions of her anatomy to prove her sincerity before
the would-be customer commits to any transactions; this sort of thing is
also becoming commonplace on the net for pornography or pirated software,
too. Would-be trafficers often ask a prospective recipient for a small chunk
of fresh files in advance, before passing back anything serious .. partially
out of suspicion, mostly out of greed, but to the same end. A law
enforcement team would be stepping onto shaky ground if they were forced to
transfer illegal images/etc to a suspected trafficer before getting evidence
from him. Entrapment is an ugly concept.

Not at all .. a porn distributor could generate a key pair, use part A to
encode the images, and dessiminate part B thru a variety of outlets -
publicly posted, sold, passed thru an informal network of like-minded
netizens...

I would argue the exact opposite - strong crypto would tend to minimize the
effective take, since there's no guarantee that /anything/ on a perp's
system will be in the clear. I'll let someone else with a better background
pound on the 'brute force' section.
