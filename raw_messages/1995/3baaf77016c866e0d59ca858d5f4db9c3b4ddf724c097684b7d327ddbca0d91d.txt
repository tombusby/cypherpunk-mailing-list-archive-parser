What is odd about that? -- when I visited Cuba a couple of years 
ago it looked to me as if a major chunk of the GNP went into
watching people.  (I hear the situation has improved since then,
perhaps thanks to their continuing bankruptcy.)

This of course is the basic evil of government regulation:  Bricks are
dangerous.  Two by fours are dangerous.  Water is dangerous.  Playgrounds
are dangerous.  Everything is dangerous, because everything could be used 
to cause harm, deliberately or accidentally.

Therefore every action needs to be supervised, controlled, and directed
by your wise and benevolent government, and any attempt to avoid the
benevolent observation of the all seeing eye shows that you must be a 
child pornographer-terrorist-drug-trafficker-money-launderer.
