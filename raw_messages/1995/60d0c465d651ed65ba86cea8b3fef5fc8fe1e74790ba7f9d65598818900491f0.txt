My cut on why it failed is that lobbying is too hard to do effectivly on a
part time basis, and those attending that the meeting realised it.

On a full time basis, lobbying is expensive, and requires that you raise
tons of money. The EFF found tons of money, and sponsored last year's
Digital Telephony disaster. He who pays the piper names the tune. EFF
got lots of corporate money, and "liked" the 94 DT bill.
So they're gone.

I read this in their actions too.

There is nothing vaguely pro-government about much of strong cryptography.
Tim's sig, fall of governments, and all that. Why should they listen to us?
Write code. Send money to EPIC and ACLU, let them lobby.
