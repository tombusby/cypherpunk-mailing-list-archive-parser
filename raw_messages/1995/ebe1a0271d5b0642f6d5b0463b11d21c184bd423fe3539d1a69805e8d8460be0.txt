While I am unhappy about many aspects of their statement, notably 
that they use the governments phrase "key escrow" all over the place, 
the fact is they have placed news about what mischief the government 
is up to, on a location that get a totally stupendous number of hits.

This will notify a stupendous number of people what the government 
is up to.

It is less than they could have done, less than they should have done,
but it is still a very big something, and having done this, before
the entire internet and all their customers, it is at least somewhat
difficult for them to then turn around and shop their customers 
to the state.
