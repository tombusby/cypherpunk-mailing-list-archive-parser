"Works" means a lot of things, even if you limit the discussion to official
court warrants requested with honest affidavits.  The code is supposed to 
discourage tampering, but suspects may still successfully disable GAK.
Escrow agents are supposed to deliver the correct keys successfully without
losing them (or storing them safely in the basement next to the cyclotron),
and they may not always provide 7x24 access (or may charge extra for it,
as well as charging for their lawyer's review of the warrant.)
Or the escrow agents may be multinationals that store their files off-shore.
Or the SECRET cleared escrow employee may have quit, making it more difficult
to handle classified requests.
