Good lord, what nasty reactions! Maybe there's hope for us
after all. I'll allow myself one reply. Sorry 'bout the length.

Putting a person on the moon was considered impossible by most
folks 50 years ago. The German v-series rockets were cutting
edge technology. Now licensed hobbyists can buy solid fuel
motors that are just as powerful some of the ones the Nazis 
had (source: _High Power Rocketry_). Things change.

Good. The article I read that suggested the possibility (I'm
pretty sure it was in _Science_ or _Scientific American_)
was rather spooky. I wish you'd said FLATLY impossible, though.
I'm (obviosly) not a biologist/geneticist/whatever, but aren't 
there bugs that go after only chimps? And didn't that ebola 
strain in Virginia only go after the lab monkeys, not the people?

People will have access to more and better equipment, though.

Heh. Guess they'll have to post extra guards at the Wonder Bread 
plant, eh? Woudn't want terrorists dosing little Jimmy's lunch.

Which will probably become simplified, streamlined, and cheaper.
Who knows what techniques will be used 20-50 years from now?
Even though (fortunately) it seems that this kind of virus would
be much tougher to produce than I thought (if not impossible), 
I can still see someone trying it and infecting EVERYONE in his 
neighborhood/city/state.

And if it is possible, well, I'd rather have the idea explored 
and cures developed (with the info available to all) before any
would-be Hitler surprised us.

Not my idea (I'm not that twisted; I find the idea horrifying). 
I read the suggestion in either _Science_ or _Scientific American_ 
(early 1993?). Incidently, the idea was a virus that went after
people with specific racial traits, not a "black-seeking virus". 
Don't attribute me with quotes that aren't mine. I have enough
problems with idiots who assume I'm a racist KKK country-music
loving redneck simply because I'm from Nashville.

Guess what sunshine, they still teach this in mid- and high-schools.
Hell, even my dictionary sez "race - 1) a division of the human
population distinguished by physical characteristics transmitted
by genes." (Webster's II New Riverside Dictionary, if anyone cares)

> if they only weren't us.

Huh?

Now back to our regularly scheduled crypto (yeah, right).
