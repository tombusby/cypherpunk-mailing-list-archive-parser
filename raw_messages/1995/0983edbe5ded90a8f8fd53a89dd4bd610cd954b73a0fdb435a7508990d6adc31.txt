Here's a question I have never heard anyone else ask (or answer!).  "What is
the purpose of a PAC?

To be more specific, a PAC simply seems to be a funnel through which
individual donations flow; why do we need a PAC?  Is it to keep records of
"who's naughty and nice"?  Any contribution that can be made by a PAC could
just as easily be made by one individual.

Which, I suggest, is better than a non-anonymous bribe.

"always"?   Are you sure about that?

It is exactly this that the system I'd propose would prevent.  I realize
that  you may not be able to imagine such a system, but that doesn't mean
that such a system could be designed.  (Before 1975, most of us would not
have been able to imagine public-key encryption, for example.)

A giver could CLAIM to make any sort of donation at all; but if the system
were properly designed he could simply be lying to the  officeholder.

Not IMMEDIATELY, perhaps, but eventually the books could be opened, perhaps
as much as years later.  (Let's say, 3 months before the end  of the term of
the politician.

And the amounts donated could withheld, with only the total donated reported
every 3 months or so.  (And perhaps only to 1 or 2 significant digits of
accuracy.)  For example, a Senator will be told on January 1, 1996, that up
until that point he's received "about" $1.4 million dollars of donations.
He would not be able to link these donations with any particular claim.
Somebody could claim to have given him "$2000" of donation, which wouldn't
even show up to the accuracy of the amount told the politician.

Further techniques could be  used to disguise the rate of giving.

>why do you think this would be an improvement? 

Easy.  It would remove much of the reason for a politician to treat one
citizen differently from another citizen.

_EVENTUAL_ public disclosure of such information is not inconsistent with
my idea.

I don't  disagree with that assessment.  However, that does not mean that I
don't want to make life as difficult for the politicians as possible until
they are swinging from a rope.

"Prior"?  It's not "prior."  I haven't changed my previous position one bit.

Not "political reform."   Political ELIMINATION.  I want to eliminate the
entire  concept of a heirarchial government.

I repeat my previous statement.  I'm happy to see them squirm before they
are led to the gallows.  Making life as difficult as possible for them is my
goal.  Using technology to disable their normal methods of corruption would
be an excellent start.
