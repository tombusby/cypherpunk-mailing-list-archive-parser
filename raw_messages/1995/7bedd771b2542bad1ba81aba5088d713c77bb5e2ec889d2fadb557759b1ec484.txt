Actually, I would be curious to find out from James what the hell he's
talking about. Yes, if you get a priv'ed user to run a program it can
do anything. Thats the case in all operating systems that I know of.

> Windows NT is supposedly secure.

And my mother is a bicycle.

NT is about as secure as VMS was, i.e. not at all. Its just got
different bugs.

You mean, it makes proof of security possible for real programs? That
there is a proof of security available for the NT kernel? I'd settle
for a proof of non-crashing myself. Short of that I'm unaware of any
system that is "intrinsically" secure.

Now, I don't believe, in general, in flaming people for gross
ignorance, but it seems that Mr. Donald believes that there is some
sort of design flaw in Unix that makes it "inherently insecure". I
have no idea what this flaw might be. I know that Unix suffers from
the same problem all other operating systems from MVS to VMS to NT to
whatever else you can name suffer from -- bugs that make it possible
to break the system. If Mr. Donald can name an operating system that
has some sort of systematic way to make it secure that he knows of --
in other words, a formal proof of security of the system (i.e. an A1
secure system by the formal nomenclature), I'll happily hear about it
from him for the first time. Certainly my teachers never heard of such
a thing, and neither have I.
