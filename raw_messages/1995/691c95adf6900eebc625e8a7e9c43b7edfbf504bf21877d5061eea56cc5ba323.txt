I'd like to see the Netscape RNG implemented as a plug-in, preferably
with sample source included to make it easier for other people to create
compatible plugins.

Once there was a published API for the RNG, other apps could use it as well.

I like the option of using a cypherpunks approved RNG.  No offense to
Netscape, but I'd feel a lot more comfortable using a RNG with say
Perry's signature or Matt Blaze's.
