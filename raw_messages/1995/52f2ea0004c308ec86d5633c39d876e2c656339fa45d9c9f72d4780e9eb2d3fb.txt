 It probably is not worth the aggravation, but ignorant, both poltically and 
as to the charter of cypherpunks, assholes like Detweiler need to be set 
straight.  Since I doubt Detweiler is open to discussion --small minds 
rarely are, we might _very_ politely suggest to the editors of Time, NYT, 
and a couple others that Detweiler is not only misinformed, but that he 
is not open to discussion.  Enough _polite_ letters to the editors can do 
wonders.
