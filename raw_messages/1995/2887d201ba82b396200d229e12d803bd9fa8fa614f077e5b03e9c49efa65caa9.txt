	1. unfortunately, the state intent is to regulate.

 	2. have you ever seen a bureaucracy that does not turn to 
           regulation one in has the power?  (unless they were asleep <G>)

	<attila sez>  but WTO is also accumulating a rather larger 
    bureaucracy and is challeng Uncle Sam on severl major unilateral
    actions.  They will have the power of international courts which,
    today, the U.S.  can ignore, but at great international bad publicity
    in a time where he have few enough friends as it is --if the U.S.
    slips into the abyss which the incompetent beltway maggots have been
    building for 50 years, the US' current "friends" will be first in line
    to screw us over --and it will be by the WTOs and world courts, or the
    Rockefeller NWO --read UN, and UN troops in America. 

	As slippery and somewhat slimy as Gingrich is, so far he has been
    the only one to put his career on line admitting to the fact the
    current overstuffed bureaucracy *does not work* --now, if he could get
    a clue other than get the government out of your nose and really
    deliver (impossible given Clinton's retrenchment in Fair Deal
    idealism)....

	<attila sez>  amen for international road signs --go metric! join 
    the living!  go 24 hour clocks and not be lost in the rest of the world!

        and, while we're at it, let's use universal time! yeah, right!
