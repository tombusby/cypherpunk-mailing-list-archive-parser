unfortunately, it appears to me that if you _really_ want encryption
to be universal, it's gotta be done on windoze, it's gotta be
point-n-click and seamless to the mail application. i would prefer it
if the masses would use a real operating system, (no o/s wars please.
i started in a mini/mainframe environment and simply don't think
dos/windoze qualify your mileage may vary), but that just ain't the
way it is. would netscape be selling at $130+ if they only wrote for
unix?

my 2 cents
