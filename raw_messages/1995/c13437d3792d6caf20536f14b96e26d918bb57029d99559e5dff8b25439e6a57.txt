        C'punks
        I saw a good article on PGP in this month's issue of American
Survival Guide. Not only did the article portray the use ofstrong crypto as a
good thing for privacy and liberty, it also tells the reader where to
obtain PGP. After that, the article goes into some of the issues surrounding
PGP such as ITAR, Phil Zimmerman's legal troubles (It even tells how to
contribute to his legal fund.) and how the government is really against it.
        After the background, the article gives clear, detailed, step by step
instructions on how to use it; from the inital unzipping of the program to
setup and key generation and management.
        All in all, I found this a very informative article for the new user
and even some of the more advanced users (Hey-you learn something new every
day, right?).
        It wasn't the type of article that wouldn't be covered in Time
or Newsweak that's for sure.
