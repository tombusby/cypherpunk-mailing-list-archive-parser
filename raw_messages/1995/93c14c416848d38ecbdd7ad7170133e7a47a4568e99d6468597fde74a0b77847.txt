Right.

RC4 encryption doesn't provide message integrity.

And I should mention that block ciphers like DES in chaining modes
like CBC don't provide message integrity either -- it's a bit harder,
but an active attacker can still tamper with the ciphertext to modify
the plaintext in a predictable way, like with RC4.

I admit it's a more difficult to mount this attack against a block
cipher in chaining mode, and the success probability may go down
(depending on the circumstances), but hey! paranoia is your friend;
and my point remains valid:

	Don't count on encryption to give you message integrity.
	If you need message integrity, use a MAC.

If you want a citation for this basic crypto design principle, I'll
be happy to provide one.

Tough!?  It's trivial for an active attacker, in the stream cipher case.
He just xors some bits: no clever cryptanalysis needed.  (Or did you mean
it's tough to mount an active attack?  I agree: that requires significant
knowledge or motivation.)

Not in SSL v3.0; it explicitly uses a (cryptographically strong) MAC
(message authentication code) on each message to prevent tampering
and modification.

Dave Wagner, speaking for himself,
but thankful for all those behind the scenes who are helping
to improve and open up Digicash communications.
