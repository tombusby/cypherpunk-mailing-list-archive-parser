If it wasn't the reason he was employed for. 

In Germany it is not allowed to spy out someone elses phone calls. (Is it 
in the USA?)  But some cases got public where employees of several companys
got their phones tapped. It was done to find out whether they do private
phone calls or what they say in private phone calls.
