Hello everybody,

the Swiss version of SKIP is now available as a pre-alpha source code release
for IRIX, NetBSD, Nextstep and Solaris.
You may get it from ftp://ktik0.ethz.ch/~ftp/pub/packages/skip.

Have fun,
    Germano


Excerpt from the README:
========================================================================
This is ENskip, pre-alpha 0.10. ENskip is a security module for the TCP/IP
stack. It provides encryption, authentication and sequencing of packets on
the IP layer between two or more machines. For more information on the SKIP
protocol, see the Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipsec-aziz-skip-00.txt and
following. You might also want to check http://skip.incog.com for information
about the background, the protocol itself and future directions of it.

ENskip is pre-alpha. If you are not absolutely sure what this is all about,
you might want to read the draft, and perhaps reconsider using this package.

No bug-fixes, installation help or any other support is granted. If you
have any suggestions, comments or contributions to make ENskip work better, 
mail to skip@tik.ee.ethz.ch.

Enjoy!

M. Hauber and Ch. Schneider
