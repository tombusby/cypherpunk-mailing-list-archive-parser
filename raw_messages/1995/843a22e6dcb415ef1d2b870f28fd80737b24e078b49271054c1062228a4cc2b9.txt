In my understanding - and I'm sure Marcel van der Peijl :-) will correct me :-(
if I'm wrong - the only way Bank B can verify with Bank A that the
ecash it has received from merchant B has not been spent before is by
actually sending the _coins_ to Bank A.  Hence there _is_ a transfer from
Bank B to Bank A and thus Bank A has to credit Bank B's account...

Marcel?
