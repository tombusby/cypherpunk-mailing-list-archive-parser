Very hard to argue that the right to write code (as opposed to, 
say, the right to write in code) existed in the late 18th 
century; hence it is hard to argue that it could be "retained" 
today.  

Assuming that the ninth amendment has, or could have, teeth, it 
is unlikely to go beyond rights existing or closely analogous to 
those held by "the people" [free white males, more likely] at 
the time of the amendment's ratification.  Just as well if you 
think about it carefully.
