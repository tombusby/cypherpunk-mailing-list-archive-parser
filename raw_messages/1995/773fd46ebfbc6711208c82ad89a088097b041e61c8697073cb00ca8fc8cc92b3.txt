You need the full quote to get the real effect:

<<Why is Zimmermann giving away voice-crypto when the feds are still
dangling an indictment over his head? "Because it's still legal for
Americans to hold a private conversation," he says. "And because I'm a
crypographer. This is what I do.">>

That is a remarkably concise, intelligent, informative, unequivocal, savvy,
and personal statement. Hats off to PZ (or whoever told him to say that).
