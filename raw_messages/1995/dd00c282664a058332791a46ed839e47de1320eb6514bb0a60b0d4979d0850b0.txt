It's much more low-tech than that.  Libraries and book stores just
put a strip of magnetized material (it's much like audio tape,
about 1/8 inch wide and comes on rolls) inside the book and then
put detectors at the doorway.  It the detector feels a magnetic field,
it buzzes; if the tape has been deguassed, nothing happens.

For libraries, it's usually mounted on sticky tape and put down
inside the book spine.  Bookstores usually just snip off a 4 - 5"
segment and slip it inside the book.  Music stores frequently tape
a small section on the outside of CD jewel boxes.

Sorry, there's no real mystery or exciting tech here.
