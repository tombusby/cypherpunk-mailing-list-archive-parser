So good for her.  I've spent most of the evening chatting on cypherpunks and
cyberia
rather than writing code....  Some recent survey found that 60% of time that
average folks spend on the net is communications rather than information
retrieval.

I rather enjoyed the movie, though I did share the experience of being
one of the two or three people in the theater laughing at various technical 
gaffes and/or in-jokes.  Obviously, you can't take anything from Hollywood too
seriously technically, but they did look at a few social issues related to
computerisation, such as the isolation, computer addiction, lack of face-to-face
relationships, difficulty in knowing what's real when everything's on the
computer,
vulnerability of society to computer problems, trustability of people who
tell you
that you can trust their computer security system for everything - even the 
government uses it!   So they didn't look into them too deeply - they're
Hollywood.
That's not their job :-)  Also, I like Sandra Bullock, and I think her acting
pulled the movie together more than the script did.
