I am not sure this is the consensus opinion. Three key triple DES uses 168
bits of key, whereas IDEA only (only?!?) uses 128. DES is also much better
studied and understood. IDEA is still a young algorithm (though close to
the heart of every cypherpunk).

The rest of what you said looks good. Too bad I did not see it before I
typed my own answer ;)
