The problem here is that you'll have to do a RSA operation on EACH 
packet.  Pretty hard on the CPU...

I'm not exactly sure what you mean by "factor-of-N".  I only used "true" 
to distiguish it from "trivial" anonymity (such as using a pay phone).  
Of course, anonymity, like security, can only be relative.

This is all very true.  I guess I'm just lamenting the loss of my ealier,
more naive dream that one day everyone will be anonymous (read
pseudonymous), and that physical and digital identities will be totally
seperate.
