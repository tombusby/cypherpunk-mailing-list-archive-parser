This is exactly how the clipper works.  The unit key is XORed with 160
random bits, the result is given to one government agency, and the random
bits are given to another agency.
 
The largest concern I have about wiretapping is not so much that some corrupt
law enforcement agents will wiretap me out of malice, but that if I communicate
with someone who is being wiretapped, my end of the conversation will be heard
as well.  I might be giving out sensitive information to some government
agent without ever violating any laws and without any reason for the government
to believe that I was a criminal.  For this reason, I believe that cryptography
should not be regulated.  I would never trust the government with any of my
decryption keys.
