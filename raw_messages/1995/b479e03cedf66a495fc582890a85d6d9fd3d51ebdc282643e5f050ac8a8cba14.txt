Sure, let us know what you find. I'm not being catty here; I'm making
a serious point about return on investment. My guess is that getting a
reasonable Van Eck capability could cost $10K, maybe less, maybe more.
And what would this show that we basically don't already know in
principle? (We've all seen televisions showing "interference" from
computers, so we know that signals are getting out....)

And if nothing is seen with our $10K of equipment, what does this
prove against an attacker who can easily afford to spend 20 or 30
times that amount to equip a van?

Cypherpunks have been exploiting technology that is comparatively
_much cheaper_ and which changes the equation.

But, again, let me not discourage you (Joel) from becoming our expert
on TEMPEST and Van Eck emissions. You may find it fun, and maybe even
profitable (consulting for corporations to harden their sites, for
example). 

I just object to the "we ought to be doing this" mentality. In
general, for reasons many of us have written about here before, and in
particular, because I think spending $10,000 to prove what we already
know--that RF emissions can be detected and demodulated--is a poor use
of money. That $10K would go a long way to getting PGP Phone finished.

Then go for it. Make this your specialty, your contribution to the
Cause. But beware of empty exhortations that "somebody ought to work
on this."
