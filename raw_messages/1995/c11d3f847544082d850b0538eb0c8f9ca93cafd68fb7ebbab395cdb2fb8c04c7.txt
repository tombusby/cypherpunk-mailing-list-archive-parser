Rich Graves makes some very good points, but he said something I want to
riff on.

(And as a measure of how apologetic some folks are getting about discussing
anything not on Perry's List of Approved Topics, Rich unfortunately labeled
his post "[ID point semi-off-topic]..." In fact, the issue of credentials
and identity is NOT off-topic, not even semi-off-topic. It is central to
the themes of our list. I urge all to read Chaum's seminal work on
"credentials without identity.")

Chris's (or Chris') points are admirable, but getting more and more
irrelevant by the day. The notion of unlinking identity and authorization
by separate pieces of identification is another form of "security through
obscurity."

The two forms of credentials can be linked in data bases. Just because one
piece of ID has citizenship or voting status and another has other stuff is
meaningless, provided the ID forms can be linked. As they can, in multiple
ways.

The credit tracking agencies can do this trivially, with names, social
security numbers, driver's license numbers, addresses, phone numbers, etc.
All are pointers into the cloud of numbers that constitutes one's dossier.

Happily, Chaum's work on "credentials without identity," based essentially
on the kind of "blinding" used in digital cash (with some differences, of
course), allows for one to display a credential showing one is old enough
to enter a bar or library (in 2005), without revealing a name (which is
just another credential).
