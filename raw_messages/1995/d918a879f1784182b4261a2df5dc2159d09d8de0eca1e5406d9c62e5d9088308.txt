Why not? It gets the issue talked about when it otherwise wouldn't be.
The cypherpunks are the Dr. Kevorkians of stupid US export laws.

Exactly. I plan to go to the Nandotimes article at URL
http://www2.nando.net/newsroom/ntn/info/info429_4.html
and see what it looks like with a few substitutions like
"cars," "highways," and "doorlocks" for words like "encode"
or "encrypt." Sarcasm is often the last refuge libertarians
have in these humor-impaired times, but it keeps me sane. :)

Well, not exactly. I believe from what I've seen here before that
it was Kelly Goen(sp?) who did this. Of course, I've advocated
everyone taking legal responsibility for Kelly's actions as a kind
of protest against creeping Naziism in "our" government (see my
"An Old Idea" post, buried somewhere in the c-punk archives).

Encryption _IS_ a party issue, and quite possibly an effective one
if we used it correctly, for the *Libertarian* Party! The actions
of both "major" parties would have been [IMO] bad PR if the media
decided to do their jobs (I know, big "if"). There is, of course, 
institutional L. party resistance to putting the individual right
to strong encryption on the "front burner" because our "generals,"
despite a consistent record of losing battles, insist on fighting
the last war (that is, when we aren't busy fighting eachother).
