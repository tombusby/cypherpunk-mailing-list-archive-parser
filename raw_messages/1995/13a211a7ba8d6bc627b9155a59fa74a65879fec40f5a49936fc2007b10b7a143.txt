Subject: Netscape "random" number seed generator code available

Once again I speak for myself and not Netscape.

The random number seed generation code is now available for review:
	ftp://ftp1.netscape.com/pub/review/RNGsrc.tar.Z
The README from that file is appended below.

Netscape has fixed other less glaring but potentially interesting
problems and those fixes will be included with the patch that goes out
in the near future.

As is mentioned in the README, more will need to be done to find more 
bits of entropy. (Too much of a good thing is still not enough.) 
However the security team believes that the RNG seed is no longer the 
weak link and candidate for attack.  So I am personally volunteering 
to have my had shaved if a discovered deficiency in this code results 
in an easily attacked generated seed. [You will be expected to show 
your work. :-)]


============================== README ===========================

This code represents the heart of Netscape's random number seed 
generator. The initialization routines are called by the various 
client front ends and servers and other Netscape software.  
Furthermore, the server will be putting seed information into the 
environment of each of the CGI invocations.

Here's some things a client does:
* Application specific files are passed to SEC_FileForRNG(). For the
client this includes the global history file. 
* The clients then read a portion of the screen depending upon the
current state of the hash.
* The Update functions feed into an MD5 hash. The MD5 code isn't ours
to publish.
* User input is used for server side key generation and in client 
front ends for increasing RNG state entropy over time.

This code needs to be portable. We can't access device specific
registers that are not guaranteed to be on all relevant platforms.

Recommendations to users of Netscape who rely on the security of
their transactions:

    If the attacker has physical access to your machine, security
    cannot be assured.

    Netscape continues to point out that if unwanted agents can log 
    into your machine, little can be secure.  For secure servers, any 
    insecure connection mechanism could be suspect.  Multi-user UNIX 
    platforms will not be as secure as single-user machines. 

	Details: Some of the system specific information that is used
	in the seed generation is available to any user on that
	system.

	To help mitigate this, the entire user environment is passed
	into the seed generation algorithm.  A wary user can alter his 
	user environment before running Netscape software.

	If someone can get root (superuser) access to your machine, 
	they can pretty much do anything.

    Netscape security could be weak if run on a platform emulator.
    Use a version native to the platform on which you are running.

	Details: Some of the usefulness of the seed generation depends
	upon the unpredictability of the low order bits of various
	clocks and timers. The clocks of many emulators may have 
	much less entropy than the actual builtin clocks.

    If you are running on a UNIX platform, make sure of the security
    of your X server.  This is also true if the X connection is not to 
    a local machine as all of the events and the data from the screen 
    read may be captured from the ethernet.

	Details: If the attacker is monitoring your user input then
	its randomness is not useful.

    It is better to perform some user action before connecting to a 
    secure site.  This means you should not set your home page to a 
    secure site or launch your client from a command line to a secure site.

	Details: While navigating through menus or typing into various form 
	fields, the Navigator uses the unpredictability of details of the 
	user actions to increase the entropy of the RNG state.

For this patch, proposed changes had to fit into the existing
code and UI structure.  We will rely on the user interactions leading 
to the initial secure page.

In future versions, the Navigator will force the user to explicitly
use the keyboard or mouse to help generate the initial seed before
doing any secure transactions. That seed will be maintained across
invocations of the Navigator.

The files are not compilable as is. They have been extracted from the
Netscape's cross platform build environment, and all of the headers
needed to compile them are not included.  They should be compilable
with some simple edits on their platforms (MFC on Windows, CodeWarrior 
on Mac).
