   10-8-95. NYPaper:


   "Foreign Policy 3.1. Microsoft as World Power." [Foreign
   affairs column]

      Does Microsoft have a foreign policy? Mr. Ballmer says
      Microsoft doesn't have a foreign policy per se. But it
      does have a global business agenda. Since Microsoft
      today has twice the market value of General Motors, it's
      worth looking at that agenda because it is bound to
      influence U.S. foreign policy. Microsoft doesn't need
      Washington to open doors for it because foreign
      governments are begging Microsoft to come in and
      translate Windows 95 into their languages, so they can
      get on the information highway. Describing his contacts
      with foreign leaders, Mr. Ballmer put it this way:
      "People say, 'You have this technology. We hear it's
      changing the world. Tell us how it can help us.' "


   10-7-95. The Econofog:

   "The myth of the powerless state." [lead for a superb 40-
   page survey of the world economy]

      The increasing "globalisation" of the world economy is
      a fact, and one that nobody can ignore. To many,
      however, one aspect of this change is especially
      important: its effect on "economic sovereignty". They
      claim that global integration is emasculating the modern
      state. If the number of believers is any guide, these
      views are appealing. Yet the new orthodoxy is wrong. The
      world has changed, the global economy has indeed
      arrived: nonetheless, the emasculated state is a myth.
