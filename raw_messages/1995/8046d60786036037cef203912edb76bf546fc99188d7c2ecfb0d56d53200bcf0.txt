Chaum is a privacy advocate when it comes to companies compiling dosiers on
you. When it comes to criminal use, my conversations with Chaum, his public
comments, and last not least the current implementation of his software
suggest otherwise.

Won't work. Ecash, except as used for frequent flyer like points, will
exist in only *one* world wide e$ currency, issued by a single entity
composed of various major banks and subject to US laws. Getting Ecash
accounts will therefore be subject to the same legal requirenments that
apply to normal US checking accounts.

You or a sting operation can always reveal the recipient by publishing the
blinding factor. Besides, your Ecash client keeps a log of the payees.
