I missed the specifics of this the first time.  How was the spammer doing
it?  Obviously he wasn't chaining his mail, or there'd be no way to know
he was from AOL.  Was JP unable to determine the guy's actual address?  Or
was he posting in the clear sans anonymity?

Sorry if this has been covered already.  I remember seeing the incident
mentioned, but I can't recall the explanation of why JP was powerless to
do anything about it.

Thanks.
