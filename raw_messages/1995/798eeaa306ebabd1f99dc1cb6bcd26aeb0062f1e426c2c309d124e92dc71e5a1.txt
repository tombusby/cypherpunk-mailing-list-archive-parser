No, it doesn't "destroy" it. PGP just needs a redesign to pass along
DNSable tags (like joe@some.domain.org) with keyIDs.

No one is proposing throwing it away. People are proposing small
changes to the format.

No, we aren't going to do that, because its an administrative

face at an IETF meeting.

No, it doesn't. Archie is a piece of shit that can't find what I need
about two thirds of the time and is slow as molasses and cannot
scale. It was a nice idea but its at the breaking point.
