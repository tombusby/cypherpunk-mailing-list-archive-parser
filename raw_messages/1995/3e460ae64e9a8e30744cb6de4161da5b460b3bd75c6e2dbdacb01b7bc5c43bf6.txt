   "Hacking Away at the Internet's Web. Security Concerns Grow
   as Saboteurs Target On-Line Sites."

      Computer hackers are turning their unwelcome attentions
      to the World Wide Web. Web sites are among the easiest
      places on the Internet to disrupt and sabotage, experts
      say, in part because many of the people who set up such
      displays pay little attention to security. Such
      unprotected systems located outside of a secure network
      are often called "sacrificial lambs," noted a manager at
      Trusted Information Systems Inc.
