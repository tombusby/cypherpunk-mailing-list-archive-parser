|| One way to establish persistent services is to use the DNS for

to
|| servers of those services by a DNS name. If the service needs to move
|| (hosts, net connections, etc), the only thing that changes is the
|| DNS zone file and the references to the service through the name stay
|| exactly the same. Hell, if your service requires no state information
|| or can have replicated data (e.g. DNS, FTP, WWW), you can use "round
|| robin" techniques with very low DNS RR TTL's to spread the service
|| load over a bunch of widely distributed hosts.

Sounds like a good idea to me. I've always kinda wondered why there wasn't
a cypherpunks.org or something.  It'd certainly make it easier for folks to
find us...
