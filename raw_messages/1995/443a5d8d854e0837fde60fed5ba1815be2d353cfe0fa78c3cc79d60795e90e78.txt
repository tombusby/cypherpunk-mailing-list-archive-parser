I heard a particularly scary quote from Director Freeh last Sunday on NPR's
Weekend Edition (I believe that was the show -- segment A-1) in which he
declared "our job is to protect the people".

If that were the FBI's job, then we'd have to look at it as one does to a
loving parent and give it all the authority and respect a child gives a
parent.
