  Perhaps the postage could integrally contain the request-remailing-
to field.  Supose the postage were <e-money, to-address> encrypted to
the remailer.  Then replayers would want to copy the to-address into a
new piece of postage.  But, we assume, they can't figgure out what it
is because they don't have the key for the remailer.  

  If the remailer issued it's own non-blinded stamps, the remailer
would have to keep a list of canceled stamps.  (For as long as that
series of stamps remains valid.)  If the remailer used Chaumiam e-cash
no logs would need to be kept at all.

  If everybody ran a second level remailer, and if they always
forwarded something (of very nearly the same size) when they recieved
an encrypted message, then without compromising the users machine it
would be imposible to say when a message was delivered.  Some of the
messages forwarded would need to be junk.  Is there a polite way to
send mail to a remailer, and ask it to junk the mail?  Some of the
messages forwarded would have to be 'part n of m' messages.

  Noyb
