My cable feed into my Mac, for example, has surprisingly little noise --
and it's only local noise (stuff only at my house, not available to the
eavesdropper) which counts as entropy.

Most Macs and PCs have audio inputs.  Most of those are mono,
unfortunately.  [The numeric difference between two stereo mics is
especially hard for an eavesdropper-wannabe to predict/compute, assuming
the room isn't silent.]  However, if the eavesdropper doesn't have a mic in
your room, there's still some entropy available on the mono channel.

Meanwhile, my old Sparcstation 1 had an A-D which, when no mic was
connected, gave about 1 bit/second of entropy.  (The newer Sparc here gives
solid 0's with no mic.)

Recorded audio is useless as entropy, of course.


Almost all computers have a mouse and a normal signature, hand-written with
a mouse, has great gobs of noise.  (I'm still working on the little PC
program to measure this -- but preliminary results show a minimum of 1 bit
of noise per mouse sample -- or 200 bits per signature.  Final results may
get higher entropy rates, but I'll wait for the real results before
claiming that.)
