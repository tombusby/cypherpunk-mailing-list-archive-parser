EXON WARNING! This message has just exposed the author, the toad.com
system, and all those who pass it on to fines of not less than $10,000!

But I share Sameer's confusion. If cops show up at my door, they must, it
seems to me, present proper warrants before they can _enter_ my premises,
or _search_ my premises. Something given to me, whether a letter, a key, a
photo, etc., is essentially *my property* and may not simply be taken away
from without due process.

I hope Black Unicorn is incorrect in his point.
