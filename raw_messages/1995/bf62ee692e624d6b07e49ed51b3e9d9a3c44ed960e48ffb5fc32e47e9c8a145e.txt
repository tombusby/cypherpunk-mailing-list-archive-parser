Interesting. I'll pick up a copy today.

I recollect that the Amiga had some gizmo--I think it was called
"MagicSack" or something like that--that let it run Macintosh programs,
sort of. It never really caught on, at least as an alternative to real
Macs. And I think something similar was available for DOS. This was all
several years back, before the Amiga faded out.

Amiga users and former Amiga users can probably tell us more.
