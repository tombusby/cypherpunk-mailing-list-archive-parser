  I had lunch with Jim Clark today, and explained the furor that was
currently going on in cypherpunks and elsewhere.  After lunch he sent
me the e-mail that I've attached below to pass along.  I think the gist
of it is that if governments require key escrow, we will have to do it
in order to sell our products with encryption into those countries.

  We've actively lobbied against the government's proposal through
our participation and support of industry efforts by the ITAA, BSA,
SPA and others.  Next week we will be sending two representatives
to the NIST key escrow conference in DC.  In preparation for that
meeting we have been formulating an official company position on
key escrow and export restrictions.  Phil, myself, and other folks with
cypherpunk leanings are involved in writing the policy statement.
We are planning on taking a firm position against the government's
key escrow proposals.  Some time next week we will be posting our
statement publicly, and will welcome your comments on it then.

  After the NIST meeting we will also be talking to folks in congress
and the white house about our position, looking for help in getting the
current export limitations removed.  We will also be looking for
help in getting the government's position on export controlled FTP
sites clarified so that we can make the US version of the Navigator
with 128-bit crypto available for download by those people who are
legally allowed to use it.

  We don't have any plans to stop doing separate US and export
versions of our software.  As long as our customers want strong
crypto and the government lets us sell it, I think we will keep
doing it.
