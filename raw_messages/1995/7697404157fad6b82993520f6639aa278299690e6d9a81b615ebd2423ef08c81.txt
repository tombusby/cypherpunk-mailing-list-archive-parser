The swap would take place in the list of schemes that must be supported 
by conforming applications.

Correct [strong should, but still should]

The protocol's part of key management for OOB shared keys is taken care 
of by naming; session key exchange with PK is not yet fully defined, but 
will  look a lot like either SKIP or Photuris. 

Naming:
   Names are strings, of the format <domain>:<name>, where domain is the
name-space from which the names are taken. The following domains are
pre-defined: 

DN:	X.500 Distinguished name. The name portion contains the RFC1485 
	ascii encoding of the DN.

URN:	Uniform Resource Name. The name consists of a URN (whatever that 
	turns out to be).

PGP:	PGP format name. A PGP user name.
