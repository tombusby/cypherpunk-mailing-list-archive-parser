As far as I can tell, that seems to sum it up. In addition, RSA agrees
in all their contracts to indemnify the licensee regarding RSA's rights to
assign the various technologies. When I called to speak to them, they
reiterated their stance. Since, we are going to be handling RSAREF, the
validity of RSAREF licenses was of some importance. Having gone through
the arbitration ruling things seem to be on track.

I'll post more of this to the RSAREF Announce list for folk.
