Okay, now that Linda Thompson seems to have trouble with Netscape, I
have to wonder if we are doing everything here right. I mean, she's a
nutcase, and although not everything nutcases say is insane, we have
to ask ourselves what is going on.

Perhaps we should wait a few days and ask Jim Clark for an official
position before doing anything to try to discourage the use of
Netscape browsers.
