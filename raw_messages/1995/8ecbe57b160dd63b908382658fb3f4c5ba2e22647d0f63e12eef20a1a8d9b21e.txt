One proposal I have seen here is to have a "coin changer" service which
turns the received coin in at the bank for you. Then the payer and the
bank and the coin changer all have to collude to identify you.  However
you have to trust the coin changer not to steal your money.  So it better
be a pretty trustworthy organization.

It would still be less than perfect to have all of a given nym's
transactions known.  In an ideal electronic cash system no transactions
are linkable if the participants don't want it.

In such a system you don't need an "account" as such, but rather the bank
simply allows used cash to be checked and exchanged for fresh cash via
anonymous connections.  This would be the most privacy-protecting system.
