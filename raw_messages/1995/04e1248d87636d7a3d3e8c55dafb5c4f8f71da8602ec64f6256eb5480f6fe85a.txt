Sandy,

The phone companies sold the information as soon as you moved.

It's called the Blue Book, any library has one for your
area. Welcome Wagons and the like buy them.

You can buy lists by address, sequential phone #'s, types of
services people order, etc. 

A recent real-life example is this:

I ordered caller-id on my phone in Nov. I already have had
three direct mailings for security devices. It is assumed by
being a girl, and ordering caller ID I am in fear.
