	Strong cryptography is needed for a secure information
infrastructure.  If American companies aren't allowed to build secure
infrastrucure, then parts of the infrastrucure will move overseas, as
insurance, liability, and deployment costs rise for a badly secured
network.

	This issue will not cause the USA to become a third world
nation, but it will contribute to large institutions moving their data
processing out.  Tim, you've talked a lot about how companies will
move data centers out of the US to avoid 'expensive' laws; do you see
the ITARs as being in a different catagory, than say, the laws on
reporting a bankruptcy?
