Its not a bad way to go. You have to make sure that you have at least
that many bits of ENTROPY, however. Stuff like keystroke timings
should only be thought of as handing you a bit or so per click.

That is true.

It actually shouldn't be -- every PC has the same timer chip or a
compatible one. The real question is whether Windows lets you get the
data out.

Also be especially careful about how you run the thing! Don't use
popen or anything like it!

You have to build to the model of someone who knows everything there
is to know about the machine. Why? Well, many pieces of information
can in fact be extracted -- license servers and SNMP agents are a way
to extract things like system IDs. (Overly chatty SNMP extensions and
similar stuff make me nervious about using too much ps based entropy,
by the by.)

If you put PROM ID into the hash, don't count it as a source of bits
-- just think of it as something extra to throw in to make life harder
-- and heavily comment that it is not to be counted in the magic 300
bits you are trying to extract. Remember, plan for the worst, not the
best, and you will never have trouble if the threat model gets worse.

As a security consultant, I always emphasize to clients that you have
to plan for worst case -- always. That way you can sleep at
night. Always assume the adversary has a way to break the individual
components of your system.

When I build firewalls, I rig them so that both an outer filtering
router, a tightened down application gateway, and an inner filtering
router must all fail in order for people to break in. I build things
on the assumption of maximum hostility on all points. Because of this,
every time a security hole has been announced for the last couple of
years -- in CISCO firmware, in Sendmail, in anything -- I've been able
to sleep because I've known that only one of many layers of protection
has been breeched and I have a few hours to fix the one layer that is
broken.

When building things like this, BUILD PARANOID. It never hurts.

Always build belt-and-suspenders around any security system. Try to
make sure that there are as many ways as possible that things have to
fail before you get nuked. Throwing an impediment in the way of
non-root users is a good idea. You program it once and it protects
forever -- an excellent investment.
