Background Research International (B.R.I.) was the first online Detective
Agency to serve the Internet. B.R.I. is an affiliate of the FairFax Group,
Ltd. a world class corporate agency with offices and client firms
world-wide.  B.R.I. provides many of the information retrieval services,
first offered by the Fairfax Group and makes them available to small and
moderate sized businesses.

The purpose of this notice is to invite you to visit the B.R.I. home page at

http://www.investigator.com/bri

Our web page will introduce you to many of the B.R.I. services and explain
how a Public Records search firm can assist your company. Perhaps you are:

         service means employee' resumes can now be verified prior to 
         submission to potential employers.

   

   

   


We believe you will be pleased with the many services offered and
surprised at the reasonable fee structure provided.
