I think the author, Axel Boldt, posted this URL to cypherpunks a while 
back...

From http://emile.math.ucsb.edu:8000/~boldt/NoShit/index.html :

Filtering the Web using WebFilter

This document describes the WebFilter (formerly known as NoShit) extension 
to Cern's httpd web server which allows you to filter out annoying parts 
of web pages that you visit often. 

Why to use WebFilter

You have probably noticed how many popular web sites that offer cool 
stuff sooner or later inevitably turn to advertising. They are very 
welcome to do that, of course, except if they try to place their shit on 
my computer screen.
