  here's a possible bullshit wrinkle.  i'm not a lawyer, but one of my
bosses was, once.

  said boss owned a boat that was of canadian registry.  he was a
canadian citizen with a green card.  he *claimed* that, even when
docked in the SF bay area, his boat was technically considered
canadian territory, due to some maritime law malarky.  US authorities
theoretically had to go through various hoops to legally board his
vessel.

  i wouldn't try to halt a SWAT team, or even the local fuzz, with
this tidbit of legal gaga.  but doing crypto development on such a
vessel might hold up in court for something as squishy as ITAR.

  naturally, commuting to canada is probably a *lot* cheaper than
owning a boat.  the uninitiated have little idea what these holes-
in-the-water really cost.... :-)
