yep. Sorry if I was unclear. Possibly even the recent Rosenburg
revelations are related, though they were reported in the media 
[in Miami at least] as coming from "the CIA" rather than from the
NSA. <sarcastic, unspoken, thoughts about "The Herald" here>

I do, but I am told I'm "paranoid." If I were running the NSA, I would
_NOT_ leave an obvious connection anyway, but those who know me say I'm
not exactly "NSA material."  ;-)

Which is my theory. "They," for me, includes FBI director Freeh, whose
post OK City mass-murder paranoid anti-crypto comments I saw on C-SPAN. 
[Hence my PGP comment below.]

Sorry, I'm almost movie-illiterate these days, but I do plan to see "the 
Net" soon,and I promise NOT to post my "review" unless I can add anything
meaningful to the previous ones, which is doubtful.<g>

Agreed. "Liberty is like love, in that you can't have any until you give it
all away." [Unknown author, aprox. quote]
