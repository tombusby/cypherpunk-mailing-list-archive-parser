Subject: (Noise) X-Files anarchist

I hardly watch TV ...blah, blah..., but I saw X-files last night.  A very
minor character was a cryptohacker who--to his surprise--brute-forced a
military key for some files.  He was described as an anarchist.

To _my_ surprise, this anarchist was not associated with violence or
lunatic ravings.  He was shown as reading a book entitled something like
Survey of Modern Conspiracy Theories.  I see this as an improvement in the
stereotype of computer-associated anarchists.  And this I see as a good
thing, since I think there is a lot that could be learned from anarchists.


I think the character was killed, but I may have missed something.
