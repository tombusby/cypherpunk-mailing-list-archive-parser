San Diego Area CPUNKS symposium  Thursday, Sep. 21, 1995

   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at "The Mission
Cafe & Coffee Shop" were I hope to get an update of Lance Cottrell's new
anonymous e-mail server, "mixmaster", exchange keys. 

   Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint.  If you can figure
out how to get it on the back of a business card, that would be cool.  

Hopefully Lance Cottrell will give us an update on Mixmaster 2.0.2
