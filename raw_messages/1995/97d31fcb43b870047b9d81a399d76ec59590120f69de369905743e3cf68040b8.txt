Then I suggest you use a different word than "prohibit." To many of us,
this implies illegality, men with guns, early morning raids, and Janet
Reno.

You don't seem to mean this.

By the way, is this really just an excercise, or are you perchance involved
in the goings-on with policy on crypto? (Not making any accusations, just
noting that various crypto policy groups are reported to be meeting...the
National Research Council thing, the key escrow initiatives, etc.)

Encrypting minds want to know.
