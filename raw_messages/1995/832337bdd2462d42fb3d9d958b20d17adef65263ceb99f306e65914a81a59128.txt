"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice, and let me  
remind you, moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue." 
 -- Aristotle, and a Goldwater speechwriter, but not Karl Hess. 

Politically Barry's Boy, Karl was often credited with Goldwater's 
most famous line, but he denied it when interviewed. Karl 
announced his Libertarian position in the book \Dear America\, 
followed by \Community Technology\, and \Capitalism For Kids\.
