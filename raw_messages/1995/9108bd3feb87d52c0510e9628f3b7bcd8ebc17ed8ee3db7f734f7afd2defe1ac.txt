No, XOR is weak if used even twice.  If you XOR the two pieces of
cyphertext with each other, you get the two plaintexts XORed.  I'd
be willing to bet that the human ear can understand two audio signals
XORed.  Certainly with practice people can understand audio that has
been encrypted with frequency inversion.  Pre-encryption compression
would solve this, but XOR is still very weak.
