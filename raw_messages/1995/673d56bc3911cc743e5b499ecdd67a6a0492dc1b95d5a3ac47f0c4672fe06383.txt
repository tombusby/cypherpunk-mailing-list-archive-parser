Time to stretch some paradigms :-)
I've decided to offer a service of certifying PGP keys for Pseudonyms.
Normally, it only makes sense to sign PGP keys for people you can
trust to really be who they say they are, but this means you can't
sign keys for people who want to use pseudonyms, which would be a Good Thing.
To try and retain a certain amount of trust in the process,
here's my policy for doing so:

0) I only sign pseudonyms with the psuedonym-signing key below,
which tries to make it clear how trustable it isn't..
1) First Come, First Served - The first user of a given name gets it,
and the only guarantee I'll make about verification is that I won't
sign more than one key with the same name unless the later key is signed
by the earlier key.
2) At least for now, keys need to  indicate pseudonymity in the name.
3) If you're using a name I recognize, I might check it out with the
person I know who uses that name.  
3A) If you're claiming to be L.Detweiler, I'll want a fax of your ID :-)

Procedures:
1) Requests by email; I will mail a copy of the key to the keyserver
and to the address you sent the request from if I can.
2) Price is 1 Digicash e$, or 1 Tacky Token, or a big prime number,
or an interesting cypherpunk-related URL (well-known sites only count
if it's something new.  New code is always interesting!)
3) I'll post interesting payments to http://idiom.com/~wcs/ ,
and if it's something that takes a while to verify (e.g. I haven't
gotten my free stuff from digicash.com yet :-) and your payment bounces,
I'll probably post that too :-)
        Pseudonym John Doe sent me a composite number 897098274398742!

                                        Enjoy!   
                                               Bill
