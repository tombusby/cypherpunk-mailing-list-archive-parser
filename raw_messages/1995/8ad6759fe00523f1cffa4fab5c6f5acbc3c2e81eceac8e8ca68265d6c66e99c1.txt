The White House and NIST annouced today that they were planning to hold two
open meetings next month to develop standards for "acceptable" software key
escrow.  The standards will then be made into a FIPS. The programs cannot
have keys larger than 64 bits.

Its great to see that it only took them 18 months (since Feb. 94) to come
up with a call for public meetings for something that nobody really wants
anyway, expcept for the officals who plan to make it mandatory by slipping
it through bit by bit and a couple of vendors.  (sorry, sarcasm mode
off...)
