    	<attila sez #2> I do not think it is particularly paranoid. the 
    trend is set. As the UN accumulates power it gains larger support from
    the third world who significantly out-vote, in terms of US standards
    of one man, one vote traditions. 

	 I also think it is going to be difficult for the permanent 
    members of the security counsel to justify their singular veto power 
    (except China, of course). The UN, as it is currently chartered
    effectively leaves the power in the hands of the security counsel; the
    general assembly generally is a forum for anti-American,
    anti-European, etc. rhetoric. 

	if the UN sets the court with open membership and no vetos, the 
    US is boxed into either defying the court with all the intendant
    public relations problems or surrendering its ecomnomic interests. 

        what it boils down to, a decison must be made between compelling 
    economic interests and one man, one vote; the latter choking the US 
    rather quickly.

        <attila sez #2> history is compressing the time frame as 
    new "history" is made.  As for the nation-state collapsing first, no, 
    I think it will be a case of the nation-state being helped along by
    the NWO or whatever globalization of power.

        I would certainly rather believe it is a long way off, but the US 
    is no longer solvent. It has gone from the largest creditor country in
    the world to the largest debtor (v. all the rest of the world
    combined) in a space of less than 50 years.  This is nothing more than
    a self serving bureaucracy promising all things to all people and
    blowing it on basic high school level economics --it is the equivalent
    of kiting checks or credit cards, for which we would go to jail.
