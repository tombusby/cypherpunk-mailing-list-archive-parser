As far as I understand, no.  

1)  you can't export PGP.
2)  even though it's out there, making software with hooks for PGP is 
    equally bad in the eyes of the NSA.  There wa some talk on 
    alt.internet.media-coverage (and the thread is being crossposted all 
    over the place) about mosaic having to remove PGP hooks before the 
    NSA would let them export.
3)  Frankly, I don't necessarily trust something that plays with my 
    personal stuff if I can't access the source code to make sure it's not 
    messin' with it :-)
