666 and 1984.  Talk about irony.

Let's see... Fourth Amendment:

 "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
  papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,
  shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon
  probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly
  describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to
  be seized."

What part of "shall not be violated" does Justice White not get?

Obscured in White's casuistry is the fact that if evidence from
improper searches can be admitted, then the Fourth Amendment itself
is largely made "moot."  White's "this shit don't stink" sophism
notwithstanding.

Uh Huh...

This is actually one of the arguments that some proponents of the
bill were using during the House Floor Debate that I was watching on
CSPAN.  If this were the case, then I wondered: Why were they so
intent to pass the bill in the first place??

I don't think that the codification of this earlier Fourth Amendment 
evisceration in federal statute is something I would characterize as 
moot.  I would regard it as a pretty sickening development even if it 
only added insult to injury.  Unfortunately, I doubt that the 666 
seal of approval will fail to further contribute to the ongoing 
destruction of our rights to privacy and due process in this country.
