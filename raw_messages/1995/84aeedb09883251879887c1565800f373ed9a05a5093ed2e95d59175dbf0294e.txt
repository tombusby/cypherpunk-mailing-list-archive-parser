I was also reading it, and I share some of Ian's questions, but for some
things I have a few different guesses.

One rather cryptic sentence, which Ian alludes to later, relates to
cancelling payments:  "The 'payer_hash' is the one-way image of a by
the payer generated random number...".  In the diagram it shows it as
f(payer_code), where payer_code is shown as "random code generated by
player".  (And, as Ian points out later, the document inconsistently
says that "the player generated random number" should be kept secret
while requiring that it be sent to the shop - at least, this is
inconsistent if it refers to payer_code.)  Assuming the use of the word
"a" is not a typo but refers to some number, this suggests that f() is
at least potentially a two-input function, some value a and a player
generated random number.

It seems that the whole payment_hdr is sent to the shop, and only the
portion before the line is sent to the bank.  This is enough, as you say,
to calculate the payment hash, so the bank can decrypt the coins.  This
prevents the shop from changing any of the information in that first part
of the payment header before sending it to the bank.

My question in this part relates to coins made out to "@" which we have
been told can be deposited by anyone.  How does the bank know to which
account to deposit such a coin, given a deposit message?  The shop's ID
does not seem to be present in such a message, assuming that the
shop_accID field of the payment_hdr just has "@" in that case.  Is it the
userid field in the userhdr message which tells the bank this info?

BTW since apparently both deposit and payment messages are not encrypted,
coins made out to "@" are in danger of being stolen both while en route
from customer to shop and from shop to bank.  This is significant from
the point of view of payee anonymous systems, which will need to use such
coins.  More encryption will be necessary when such coins are passed
around.

Well, I would think identification of the payer's bank will be
necessary for any coin based system so you know where to cash in the
coins, so I don't think this is going to go away.  Of course as of now
everyone has the same bank so it is not an issue.

The signatures are xor'd with the payment hash, but this is not the main
way they are encrypted - they are then encrypted with the bank's public
key.  The purpose of this xor is not so much to protect the coins as to
bind them unbreakably to the payment header.  Since the coins are always
sent around with that payment header I think they all do use the same
payment hash.

I was wondering about this too.  There is a reblocking problem in
trying to concatentate "pure RSA" operations.  In particular M must be
at least as big as N.  This is not necessarily a problem, but it is a
slightly unusual constraint on key creation.  However I agree overall
that this formula is a reasonable reading of the doc.

There also needs to be some clause for the "@" payee.  In that case I
think the payment is accepted if the signature checks, with credit to the
userID account.

That business about cancelling via payer_code I agree is not very
sensible.  It doesn't seem necessary - the coin can just be re-spent,
made out to someone else.

There is no such thing!  This is one of the most common misconceptions.
This version of ecash does not trace double spenders.  It prevents double
spending by checking each coin to make sure it has not already been
spent.  Tracing of double spending is only necessary in offline systems
where coins are not checked right away, but that is not present here.

My guess is there would need to be some manual intervention to do this.

Well, as I said, I think this payer_code business is pretty questionable.
I'm sure the next version of the doc will clear that up a great deal.  As
far as determining r, that is not possible from the protocol messages.
Chaum has proven that it is absolutely indeterminate.  So I don't
understand what you mean about "more security has to be added to the
present ecash system if unblinded withdrawals are allowed."  Do you just
mean that the coin messages should not be sent in the clear in that case?
I observed that coin withdrawal messages can be sent in the clear in some
postings I made last year - the use of r effectively encrypts them.  But
of course that can't be done with unblinded messages.

There have been claims that the long string you type in at startup time
deterministically seeds the RNG, so that if you lose your wallet but you
tell DigiCash this string (via some secure channel, presumably) they can
reconstruct the coins you should have.  Presumably they could figure out
what the r values were when you withdrew all your coins, reconstruct the
coin numbers, and see which ones haven't been spent.  This is both good
and bad, in that it provides a well understood amount of entropy (rather
than relying on whatever it can scrounge up), but of course is vulnerable
to lazy typing.  Also, you have to write down the string, and if someone
found this they could perhaps get your coins.

Very good comments.  I'm sure the next version will be much better if
they are careful to clear up the kinds of issues you have raised.
