I'm be piceing together things on this list that I have only a passing 
understanding of (at a code level).

If it costs $10,000 to crack one 40-bit key (putting aside whether we 
agree on that price or not), could not the software be designed in such a 
manner that it is able to check, say, 10,000 keys at the same time?  Ie, 
it computes a key, and then checks it against the array of data to see if 
it fits any of them, and then goes on to the next one.

Maybe that would be an interesting test.  Randomly compute say 10,000 
sessions and they try to crack them all at the same time.  Theoretically, 
it would reduce that $10,000/crack cost dramatically.

Of course, I could very well be wrong....
