  Sorry, my Greek is rusty.  Shoulda been "onymous", I suppose.

  But if the escrow agent is anonymous, we simply recurse, moving now to
the question of whether anyone can trust the Anonymous Escrow Agency not
to take the money and run.

  A bank has $$ invested in impressive-looking buildings, (so that
vanishing into the ether and setting up shop elsewhere is rather
difficult) and several officers whose TrueNames are registered with the
appropriate agencies, so that they may be sued if they pull this
crap.

  While individual stockholders might appreciate the anonymity (and
protection from legal action) of owning stock in a bank or escrow agency
(might just combine the functions, while we're at it), they demand
onymity of the officers with whom they entrust the keys to the
corporation.
