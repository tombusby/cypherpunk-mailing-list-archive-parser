Sure that's hard to notice, but what you describe was an accident, ie
the code wasn't working as you thought it was.

The netscape one by the sound of it, and the earlier posts of the
reverse-engineered ran no code, was working to spec, it was just a
dumb spec.

I felt sorry for netscape when they got chosen as the example of an
ITAR crippled app to break, the breakers intention obviously being to
tar ITAR, but some of the bad publicity rubbing off on netscape, who
were obviously fully aware of the weakness of 40 bit keys.

This one tho' sounds very much like due to sloppy design which is
inexcusable, especially given that they are going around selling the
128 bit RC4 browser to people who may have been relying on it, at it's
word, and presume the rest of the cryptographic system was up to
suitable standard to match 128 bit keys.

aka what's the point having 128 bit keys if you use a 32 bit, or 40
bit or 48 bit seed, which can be further narrowed with non-root access
to the machine, and even with external info leaked by the machine.

Well that is a valid, and very good moral, but the netscape story is a
different story I think, as they knew what their code was doing, and
somehow didn't think it was a problem, or didn't even pause to
consider the ran no generation security.  Reckon any bad publicity
they get out of this one is entirely their own fault.

The moral in netscapes story is that closed systems are bad news.
These things ideally need open review.  And of course designing things
with the expectation that they are secure with the *given* that the
full algorithm is known.

Real shame because the rest of the software is very innovative
compared to other browsers, and apparently good quality.  Also may be
a set back for net commerce, which is bad news.
