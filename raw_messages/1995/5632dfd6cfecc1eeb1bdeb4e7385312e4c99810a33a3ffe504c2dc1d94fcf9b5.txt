I wasn't personally involved in any of the cases, but I susupect the 
answer re encryption is zero.  There was the time the FBI agent failed to 
push the record button, however.

My response was to the wiretap correlation to career-making cases.  I 
don't believe encryption is widespread enough yet to be a serious problem 
in the Title III area.  It is a potential problem, though, as encryption 
(rightfully) spreads.  The question I am debating with myself, with all 
of your help, is what the policy "ought to be."

Even if I ultimately come down in my own mind on the Cypherpunks side of 
the line, understand that, as far as policy goes (and, hell, everything 
else for that matter), I'm a nobody.  But I try to make up my own mind 
about what is right.

Not a lawyer on the Net, although I play one in real life.
