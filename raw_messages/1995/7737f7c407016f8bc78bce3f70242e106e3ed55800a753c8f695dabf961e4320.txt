A couple of months ago, the release of PGPfone got the list started on 
hardware alternatives to PTN encryption... An associate of mine recently 
returned from the Consumer Electronics show in Hong Kong and broght me a 
lot of stuff including a flyer for a telephone scrambler.

From the flyer:

Secure your telephone conversations through high-tech scrambling.

Never again be concerned with eavesdroppers!

Description:

With our state of the art Telephone Scrambler you can now discuss 
confidential business and/or personal matters over the public telephone 
network without worrying about eavesdroppers. This compact and easy to 
install unit renders taps and monitors useless by way of rolling code 
encryption. Eavesdroppers will hear nothing but gibberish, ensuring 
complete privacy for all your telephone conversations. The Telephone 
Scrambler allows you to set your own unique code ensuring that only you 
and the party that you are speaking with can decode the conversation. Two 
units are required -- one for each end of the conversation.

Features:

o One-touch scrambling
o Thousands of key combinations
o "Rollig code" scrambling
o Works with Tone or Pulse
o Easy connection
o LED display
o FCC registered
o Compact and Portable

Specifications:

Power: 12 VDC
Dimensions: 5 1/2" X 3" X 1"
Weight: 6 oz
PTN Connection: USOC TJ-11C
Keys: 2^12

Well, in itself it isn't very impressive. However, I plan on giving them 
a call tomorrow and check prices. If they aren't that bad I'll get one 
and pull it apart. Perhaps it can be at least reprogrammed for more keys 
and another encryption algo. Hell, at 2^12 keys, all it takes is a few 
seconds to find which one the conversation is using.
