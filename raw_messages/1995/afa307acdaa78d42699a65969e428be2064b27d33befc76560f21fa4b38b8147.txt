The jurisdictional problems are going to be very interesting.  As with
gambling.  Nations are reluctant to extradite their nationals for acts that
are not crimes at home.  The US follows this practice just like everyone
else.  Witness the lack of success of the German government in extraditing
neo-nazis from the US.  They had to grab one in Europe.

This is the real problem for the Feds.  When everyone is a non-bank
financial institution...

Hard to control what you don't know.

But unlicensed NBFIs don't have licenses to pull so regulation is tricky.
An unlicensed NBFI includes any institution in another jurisdiction (no *US*
license) and any person running Quicken version 9.0 that will no doubt
support exotic electronic payment systems.

Generals are always fighting the last war.  Banks are history particularly
if they are unable to offer competitive services because of regulatory
restrictions.

Which are trivial to defeat particularly under an EPS system when the
customer hands his keys over to his actual principal.

Note:  I've often wondered why the rulers place so much faith in their
ability to identify people when those who have studied the Is A Person
problem have thrown their hands up.
