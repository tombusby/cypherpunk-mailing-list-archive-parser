Thanks. Two other people sent me e-mail saying the odds of a keyspace chunk
being left uncovered are 1/e, so this part is pretty well known. (With an
expectation of "1" of course, as I noted. Interestingly, this was the same
formula we used at Intel to figure out chip yields: "What's the probability
that a chip will have zero defects given that m defects are the "expected"
number?")

I wanted to explain the derivation in more detail than just saying 1/e,
especially for the more interesting cases where the keyspace gets more
coverage. (Where the m = expected value is more than 1.)

Indeed, this is an effect to consider. That is, each searcher is
(presumably) not overlapping, so the results I reported are sort of a bound
on the actual numbers. At one end, with lots of searchers doing very small
fractions of the total, the results are pure Poisson. At the other end,
with a searcher covering most or all of the keyspace, then of course the
results are those of nonrandom search. Practically speaking, with dozens or
hundreds of searchers, the Poisson results produce accurate enough
estimates.

A very good point! Anonymous cracking has many advantages.
