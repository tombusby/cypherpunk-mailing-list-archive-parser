Just as a notary public does not certify that a given document is truth,
but rather that it is what it is and the signature belongs to the person
who it appears to belong to, a public timestamp/notary/encryption service
on the 'net would certify the existence of that document in that form at
that time. No more, no less.

If I recall correctly, a notary can certify a sealed envelope without
knowing its contents, by putting a tamper-proof seal on it. Sound familiar?
I'll try to find a notary to see if that's the case. If so, we're got as
good a precedent as we'll ever find for just about anything.
