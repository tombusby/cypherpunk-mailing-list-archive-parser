San Diego Area CPUNKS symposium  Thursday, December 7, 1995

   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at "The Mission
Cafe & Coffee Shop".  Get the latest update of Lance Cottrell's anonymous
e-mail server, "mixmaster", exchange keys, and discuss other topical
subjects.  If you are in to what's happening on the list, encryption,
privacy, The Mission is the pace to be.

   Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint and forms of
identification.  If you can figure out how to get it on the back of a
business card, that would be cool.  

   Drop me a note if you plan to attend.
