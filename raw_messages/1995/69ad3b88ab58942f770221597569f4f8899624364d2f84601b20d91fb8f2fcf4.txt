I don't enjoy it, and don't particularly care to hear it - HOWEVER, I don't
see that they are harming anyone (I don't count "hurt feelings as "harm), 
any more than Malcolm X did when he called all white people "the devil," 
or when the militant Muslims do when they call all non-Muslims "heathens" 
or "the infidel" who should be killed.  (or any more than wingate does 
when he says all non-Jews should be done away with).  They are simply 
trying to "sell" their views by exposing their views.  
 
If they want to think that, and if they want to say that, then that is their 
business.  I'm free to listen, or to avoid listening.  I can avoid their 
newsgroups, or turn off my radio.  That doesn't mean I have to like them, or
be nice to them - I am just as free to ridicule their views, and I won't care 
if I hurt their feelings.
 
If this sort of speech is regulated however, I will no longer have that 
choice.  


If I ask the government to prevent them from speaking their views,
them only *I* am free to speak mine, so who is the victim?
