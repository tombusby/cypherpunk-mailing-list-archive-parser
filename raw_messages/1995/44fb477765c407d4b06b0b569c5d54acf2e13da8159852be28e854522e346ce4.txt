	My understanding is that the accounts are "WorldCurrency
Access" accounts-- which appear to be Money Market funds, which can be
denominated in one of 25 currencies. (Ecash-linked accounts must be
denominated in dollars.) Being a money market fund, a positive return
is -not- guaranteed, and it is not FDIC insured. It is an "investment"
account, not a "savings" account. (That is my understanding, which
could very well be flawed.)

	Does anyone understand their non-merchant pricing structure?
It had me very confused. Also, what is the difference between a
merchant and a non-merchant. I saw nothing on the pages describing
that. Suppose Community ConneXion wanted to accept ecash. Could we get
a non-merchant account?
