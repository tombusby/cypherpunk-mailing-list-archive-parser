The FBI now says they only want to tap 1% of simultaneous capacity,
not 1% of total number of lines.  On the other hand, the actual utilization
of the telephone network is also much lower than the number of lines -
back when I was a voice-telephony geek, our estimates for busy-hour
phone utilization were about 1/12 for residential and 1/6 for business
(3 and 6 hundred call-seconds per hour); that was before widespread
use of fax machines, modems, or LANs, so business utilization has
probably increased.  Equipped trunk capacity was typically enough to
have a maximum of 1% blocking during busy hour, which means a certain
amount of margin over average calls in progress, and switch capacity 
depends radically on technology - some kinds of switches are non-blocking,
while others have various capacity limits.
