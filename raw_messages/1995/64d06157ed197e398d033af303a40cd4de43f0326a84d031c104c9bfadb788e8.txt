This might not be as much of a problem as you think.  Given that there
will likely be a mixture of free and pay remailers, and that a given
message may chain through one or more of either type, why not place the
stamp for each pay remailer inside the encrypted sub-packet which that
mailer will receive?

Think of each remailer as an independant post office.  For each pay
remailer, you need one stamp.  Ideally, each stamp would be a bit less
expensive, but since remailers don't need to share their revenue, that
shouldn't be much problem.  An intelligent chainer (Chain++, maybe?)
could keep track of your postage and put the stamps in the proper inner
envelopes.

This would work best if all the pay remailers accepted a common brand of
stamp.
