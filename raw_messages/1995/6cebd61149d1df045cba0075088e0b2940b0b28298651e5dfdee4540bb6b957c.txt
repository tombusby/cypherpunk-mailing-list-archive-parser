Fooey. Of course. Scratch that plan.

Eeeeek!

I chatted with a colleague at work, and he helped bend my mind right.
I had the mistaken notion that adding lots of data would "overflow"
and "dilute" the entropy to an attackable state.

In a 386 or a 486 (under FreeBSD at least) there is a 1Mhz clock available.
How would _this_ be? On the Pentium there is the <whatsit?> register
which will give the board's oscillator (or 90 MHz) I believe.

Ah yes - _that_ register. :-)

What then is a body to do? Preserve all _verifiable_ randomness like gold?
Dish it out under some quota? A denial of service attack would be

forever {
	cat /dev/random > /dev/null
}

Severely limiting most decent folk's chance at getting PGP to work.

Right now I am considering making a piece of cheap hardware to deliver
noise to a digital input. (Electronics is a stagnant hobby of mine)
Interested? I may knock up a prototype in a month or so...

Can they predict thermal noise in a cheap transistor? ]:->

This is a strong argument for some form of specialised noise source.
I have read of methods of getting this from turbulent air flow in a hard
drive (an RFC, I believe).

If I was running Fort Knox, I'd probably use Radioactive decay...

(From my experience working at a cyclotron facility - these SOB's are
_*RANDOM*_)
