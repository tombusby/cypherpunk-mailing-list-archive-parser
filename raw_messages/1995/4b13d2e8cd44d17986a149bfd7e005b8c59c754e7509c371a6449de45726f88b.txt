Thanks, Nick, for summarizing this clearly in terms of these two axes. This
symmetric untraceability is what I was getting at with my point about Bob
clearing the transaction and getting back blinded cash. It's apparent that
if Alice can get untraceable cash, and she tells her bank to go ahead and
give the same kind of untraceable cash to Bob, then Bob can also get
untraceable cash.

Offline clearing has many hurdles to overcome, and this "True Name" (ID)
issue is not very attractive. Fortunately, the vast increases in Net speeds
are on the side of online clearing, even for relatively small transactions.

Sounds pretty compelling to me to concentrate on online clearing systems....

I can imagine limited needs for offline clearing, such as road toll
systems, or parking tokens, etc. The amounts of money there can be somewhat
limited, and the implications of double spending revealing identity are
less serious. (Though I can imagine a worrisome scenario where a highway
toll system "deliberately double spends" received tokens to track
motorists...there may be precautions built into such systems that I just
don't know about.)
