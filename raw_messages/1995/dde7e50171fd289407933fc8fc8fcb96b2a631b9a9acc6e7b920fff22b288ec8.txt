I found this book several days ago in a local bookstore and sat down on the
floor to read (most of) it. It's one of those thin, 130-page-or-so books,
about the length of what many of us can write in a few days. (I'm not
claiming our stuff is as publishable, just that the publishing industry
seems to love being able to charge $25 for a hardback book of 30,000 words!
The imminent death of conventional publishing predicted!)

Yet more bashing of computers. I found nothing insightful in this book,
just a personal account of the author's struggle to understand why so many
of his friends are using computers so much.

Bashing the cybernetic aspects of our culture is hot these days. I expect
Oprah and Sally Jesse to soon be doing shows on this. Children whose
mothers are Net addicts, brothers who kill their sisters for using "vi,"
and jilted cyberlovers who are in relationships with their shrinkwraps.
