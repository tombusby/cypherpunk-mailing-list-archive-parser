It's no worse than the other hundreds of products that have macro languages
that can write files (even the ones that can't execute other programs are
dangerous if they can write a real executable to a file and, say, add a
corresponding RUN= line in a WIN.INI or the equivalent to get it executed
later).  Word's is just more visible because the macro itself can behave
like a virus, because of Word's autoexec-macro feature that can make the
macro run automatically unless they user disables those options on his copy.

Many versions of PostScript have this kind of hole, I understand; some
disable the file-manipulation commands to be more secure.  I remember
hearing recently that Ghostscript, popular on PCs, is one that does have the
file-manips, but all of this is hearsay so I can't say for sure.
