One of the problems commenting on long thoughtful posts is the number 
of hooks, and limiting oneself to just a few.

Well, I certainly hope so.  But let's remember Poland in 1979, where 
"they" were desperate enough to shut down the entire phone system.  
It gained them only an extra 10 years of control, but it cost the 
Poles a *lot* of misery.

But "samizdat" raises an interesting economic issue around security.  
The Soviets paid just enough attention to the circulation of 
hand-written or typed copies to make sure people spent a lot of time 
and energy at it -- time and energy not spent on more obviously 
dangerous activity.   Compare the volume of Solzenhitsen's output 
before and after exile [let's not debate quality].  That didn't mean 
samizdat wasn't subversive and long-term dangerous -- but it was very 
expensive and absorbing to dissidents and potential dissidents.

But that's the situation cypherpunks [and friends :] want to put our 
hypothetical eavesdroppers [government or corporate] in.  Not exactly 
harmless, but spending a lot of time and energy being concerned with 
the chasing multiple carbon copies of samizdat novellas.

I find that techno-illiterate Greens have very little trouble 
understanding FIDONet -- it's the kind of small-scale organizing 
within larger networks that a lot of progressive activity has always 
followed.  They find it very hard to believe that other kinds of 
techie nets are really secure in the long run.  It is, in fact, the 
level of activity that the Poles reverted to without the phone 
system ...

Geez, I have enough trouble getting card-carrying Greens to use 
and/or develop good ecological metaphors without some 
crypto-anarcho-libber punk muscling into the territory!  ;-)
