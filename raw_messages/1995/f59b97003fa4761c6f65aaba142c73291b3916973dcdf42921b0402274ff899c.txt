The real secret is that for most banks the individual transaction
is << than the total stream of transactions.  Defaulting on a single
transaction will show a profit that is miniscule compared to the
over-all earnings at stake if the bank's credibility is jeopardized.
When banks have gotten into trouble it is frequently when they allow
one customer or one transaction to represent a significant share
of their business.  You have a high probability of being able to
trust an escrowee with your $1 if you know he intends to collect
commissions on holding $1million for others based on his "trusted"
representation.
