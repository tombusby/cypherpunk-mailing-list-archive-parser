as if PRZ is not already enough of a folk hero....
BTW, he has been beat by Nautilus, right? Nautilus
is public domain, right? (I'm thinking of that public
domain voice encryption released a few mos ago).
I wonder if he is going to try to put a "spin" on this
one to differentiate it from the other one. on the 
other hand, just having his name on it is plenty of
"spin"...

TAPS FOR THE CODE BREAKERS
 
The cryptographer who riled the federal government over his popular
encryption software, PGP (``Pretty Good Privacy''), claims he is only a
few weeks away from launching yet another dazzling piece of software:
PGPfone. Philip Zimmermann's latest product permits virtually untappable
telephone conversations through personal computers. But the launch of the
software, which uses military-grade encryption to scramble transmissions,
is likely to sharpen the debate among those who worry about such
technology falling into criminal or enemy hands and those who consider it
essential for secure communications, especially on the Internet. In a test
of the new software last week, a U.S. NEWS writer, using a
microphone-equipped laptop in Washington, found the encrypted conversation
with Zimmermann in Boulder, Colo., to be remarkably clear. Zimmermann, who
ran afoul of the government over charges--strongly denied--that he
illegally ``exported'' the PGP software on the Internet, says he plans to
give away his new software for free. Why? ``I can't simply stop doing what
I do because I'm afraid of angering the government,'' he says. ``Americans
have a right to private conversations.''
