Well, I still don't understand why you call a message that says 
	1) "I tried too verify a signature"
	2) "please mail me your key"
	3) "if there's a bug, please mail the author"
a "warning".  

I guess we're just using the word "warning" differently...

I never stated or implied that anyone "needed to" respond to
query-mail.  To the contrary, I said in all seriousness that ignoring
query-mail was "a fine anarchistic solution to the problem".

Well, I still don't understand your objection to labor-saving software
any more than I understand the lifestyles of the Amish, but that's my
problem, not anyone else's.

I did not take your comments on mail-secure.el as an attack on myself,
but I did want to defend both the use of labor-saving software and
parts of my particular implementation.  Specifically, I defended the
package against incorrect accusations on your part:

1) the query-mail was not a warning
2) the query-mail was not in response to the content of a post
3) the query-mail was not the first method used, but a last-ditch attempt
4) a human is in the loop
5) the keyserver used is not based on some trivial "preference"

However, I do agree whole-heartedly with your above assertion that
"great care must be taken in running automated mail-response
programs".  For this reason I have responded to your and other posts
by adding features to the package to make it even less likely to
bother people who don't want to be bothered.

To the very best of my knowledge *I* did not send you a piece of mail
requesting your key...I've had your key in my keyring for over a year.
Further, I am not asserting that I saw a signed message from you any
time recently.

Nonsense?  It seems to me that the information is useful, for two
reasons:

(1) it alerts the recipient to the semi-automated nature of the mail,
		which allows the recipient to prioritize his response (if any)
		to it.
(2) it alerts the recipient that incorrect receipt of a key-request
		could be caused by a software bug (as opposed to some attempt
		to forge email).
(3) it notes the existance of the package, which the recipient might
		be interested in (in the same way many cryptography-aware
		programs add a comment line to a PGP-signature).  By the way,
		I have had several people ask for a copy of mail-secure.el after
		receiving a key-request from the package, which translates
		into several more people encrypting their email and verifying the
		messages they receive.

Once again you're [ willfully ? ] missing the point: etiquette and
preferences have nothing to do with it, and your repeated assertions
to the contrary trivialize the desire of some people to authenticate
messages they receive (which I and others consider to be a reasonable
goal).
