I have a theory about this.

First, I recognize the style of the quote, as no doubt many of you do.

Second, my guess is that the reporter contacted the person being quoted,
asked "What is your role?," couldn't interpret the answer given, and so
used the only term he understood. Namely, leader or moderator.
