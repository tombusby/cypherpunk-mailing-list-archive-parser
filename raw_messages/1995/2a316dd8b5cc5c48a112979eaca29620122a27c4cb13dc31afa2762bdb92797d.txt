We're at a standoff here.

Not as you describe it.  No.

This is our standoff.

Actually, I think that much coercion (as I used it) is outside the state.
I also believe there is much evil outside of coercion but that is probably
outside the scope of the topic.  I do admit that I am emphasizing coercion
and using that as the dividing line more than other types of evil.

I refered to the physical force used by gangs to enforce neighborhood
rules.  After pondering this, I think this does not apply to my approach.
The state is brought up because it is the agent of coercion in licensing.

The first is not.  The Clipper program (as I understand it) is.  Remember,
my guideline is simple threat of physical harm.

I'll look for Nozick.

I think such a certification is consistent with my desire for alack of
physical coercion in this.  I assume you'd be willing to let the market
prove this point.

I think there is a big difference between "I'm going to break your house
windows unless you give me $50" and "I'm going to stop delivering milk
unless you pay your $50 milk bill".

No.  And for me there are cases when it would be wrong.  I won't comment on
when it is wrong for others, but in the alternate case that includes
violence or the threat, I will say it is wrong.

A BA and BS have become practically the same, but a BSET (tech) is very
different from a BSEE (engineer).

Oh. You are right in the last part.  The distinction is NOT the effect.
Not the emotional effect either.  It is the ethics and pragmatics of
relying of a competition of ideas and not force.  To put it bluntly,
coercion (as I defined it: murder, theft, ...and the threat thereof) a sin.

Agreed.  I have clear guidelines.

The concepts of coercive methods and noncoercive methods are there
regardless of the words.  I prefer agents of the first over agents of the
latter.

[Agreed.]

Let the market decide if there really is one.

Let the market decide.

The difference in effect is in emergent market optimization.  The
difference in purpose is ethical.

I have learned that you--and perhaps others--do not see an important
difference in these two styles of influencing behavior.  I see a major
difference and in thinking the difference was obvious was slow in
understanding your position.

Great.  You're already enjoying breakfast and I still have to go to bed.
