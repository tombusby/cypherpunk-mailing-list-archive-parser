		Workshop on Information Hiding 

		    First Call for Papers 

		     30 May - 1 June 1996

	Isaac Newton Institute, University of Cambridge, UK


Many researchers are interested in hiding information or in stopping other
people doing this. Until now, their efforts have been fragmented, with
different groups interested in copyright marking of digital objects, covert
channels in computer systems, subliminal channels in cryptographic
protocols, broadcast encryption schemes, low-probability-of-intercept
communications such as spread spectrum and meteor scatter, and various
kinds of anonymity services ranging from steganography through location
security to digital elections.

However these areas of study are closely linked, and we wish to create an
opportunity for a fruitful exchange of ideas. We are therefore organising a
workshop on information hiding, which will form part of a six month
research programme being held at the Isaac Newton Institute on Computer
Security, Cryptography and Coding Theory. Given a positive response
from the research community, it is hoped that this will become a regular
event.


Instructions for authors:

Interested parties are invited to submit papers on research and practice
which are related to these areas of interest. Submissions can be made
electronically (latex or postscript; preferred format is latex using llncs.sty)
or in paper form; in the latter case, send eight copies suitable for blind
refereeing (the authors' names should be on a separate cover sheet and there
should be no obvious references). Papers should not exceed fifteen pages in
length.
