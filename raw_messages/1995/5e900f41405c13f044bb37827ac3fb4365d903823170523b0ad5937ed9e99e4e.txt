I felt the same way recently.  I had commented here about elec cash
prodigy Stefan Brands being among those not getting into the DigiCash demo,
it got cross-posted to www-buyinfo (which is read by DigiCash people) and
led to a big political stink that may have set back relations between
Brands and Chaum and therefore the prospects for high-quality digital
cash.  I really regretted my words as it was certainly not my intention
to stir up bad blood.  I still tend to think of this list as a relatively
private place to make comments "just among friends", unlike more public
venues which feed into a wider cross-section of views and where I try to
be much more circumspect.
