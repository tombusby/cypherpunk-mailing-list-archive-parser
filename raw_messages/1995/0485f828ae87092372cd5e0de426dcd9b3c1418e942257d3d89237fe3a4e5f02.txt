I always supply picture ID these days.  It's really rough getting those cold
lamination-Employee ID kits from Office Depot, taking the polaroid on a blue
background, trimming the photo, and assembling the employment ID.  I'm one
of my best employees.

Don't forget to include your EMP_NO.  It gives the clerk something to write
down.
