The problem of liability should be managable. There are commercial data
storage firms (microfilm, etc.) that not only have access to the key for
your data, but to the data itself. Still, liability lawsuits have not
driven them out of business. I therefore belive that liability issues will
not pose a significant obstacle to commercial key escrow.
