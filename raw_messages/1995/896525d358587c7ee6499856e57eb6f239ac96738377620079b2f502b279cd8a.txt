|     Could someone try this on Solaris using 1.12?

Just tried it, with two different mailhosts - the first gave the following
error:

	An error occurred sending mail:
	The "To:" header was invalid.

	Please check the email address(es) and try again.

The second accepted the mail. (?) Neither caused it to core dump, under
the X11R6 X server, Solaris 2.4, running Openwindows.

Cheers,

Steve
