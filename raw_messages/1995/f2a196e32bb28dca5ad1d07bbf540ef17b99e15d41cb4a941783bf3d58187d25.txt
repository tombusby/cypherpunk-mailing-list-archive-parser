I didn't put anything in my FAQ about "mod" because my FAQ was not a crypto
FAQ per se, of which there are at least two. (Cf. sci.crypt for regular
pointers.)

And I doubt that either of these FAQs discusses the mod function, though I
haven't checked.

In any case, Schneier devotes several pages to mod, starting with "You all
learned modular arithmetic in school; it was called "clock arithmetic"" (p.
198).

After defining it, Schneier goes on to discuss its use in modern cryptography.

If this isn't enough of an explanation, I don't know what more to say.
