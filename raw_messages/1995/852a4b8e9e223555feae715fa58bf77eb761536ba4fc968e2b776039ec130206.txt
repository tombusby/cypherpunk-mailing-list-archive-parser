This doesn't make sense.

Someone wants to commercialize Mixmaster.  You don't know who it is,
but you since you can't see how to make money doing this, you suspect
their motives.  Yet on the other hand, you think they will be so
successful that enough people will buy binary-only servers such that
backdoors are a real threat, perhaps by forcing people to upgrade
or otherwise breaking interoperability with the current free-source
remailer network.

You can't have it both ways.

But even if you could, there's a solution. :)  Download the source
and start releasing "blender", a free-source anonymous remail system
that is upwardly compatibly, *and based on* the current Mixmaster.
