I'm writing an article on TEMPEST technology.

The focus is on what TEMPEST is and how to defeat it, if possible.  So far
I've gotten some insightful information, but I'm looking for all I can get.

Has anyone ever heard of TEMPEST being used in the continental US?  Can anyone
tell me what measures offer some level of protection, or steps that can be
taken to reduce the likelihood of being successfully targeted?  Has anyone
ever seen TEMPEST in action?

Any and all information will be greatly appreciated.

I prefer responses via e-mail to dzeanah@holonet, but I also read this
newsgroup pretty frequently.

Thanks a lot.
