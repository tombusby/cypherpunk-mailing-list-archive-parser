Subject: Australian "calculatorcard"

Hi everybody,

CG> Yesterday, on UK Discovery, there was an item in the programme
CG> Beyond 2000 about an Australian card which implements a
CG> challenge-response protocol and can be used for banking, etcetera.
CG> Basically, you give your card number (over the phone), get a
CG> challenge number, enter your pin and the challenge, and then give the
CG> response. All in CC format...

sounds like the card i use for remote dialup to certain non-public
systems i use at work. it has a six digit number on the front that
changes every 60 seconds. the card is registered to me. when i enter
my username/password i'm prompted for the number. it's Pretty Good
(tm) security, but like anything not biometric, it is vulnerable to
black-bag attacks. physical possession being all that is required. if
you know the algorithm and the serial number of the card and the
time, even that isn't necessary.


CG> Can anybody provide me with pointers to more in-depth information
CG> about this device and the algorithm(s) behind it ?

i don't know if there are any net sources for them, but i'd be
suprised if not. my card references "security dynamics" of cambridge
massachusetts.
