Just to sidetrack the issue, a bit.  Are there any ex-Nazis who participated
in the Holocaust who would dispute this guy?

This is a little different from the US. I've never heard of anybody being
jailed or fined for libel/slander, just sued for it.

No. You can't libel the dead.  Most historians would get their socks sued
off if you could.  I remember reading about a case once in which two sons
wanted to sue the man who had libelled their dead father.  They couldnt do
it through normal channels, father being dead and all, so they publicly
called the libeller a liar, repeatedly, eventually provoking _him_ to sue
_them_ thereby allowing the truth of the original liber to be tested in
court.  The sons won; a moral victory at least.

So in other words, the Holocaust-Denial crime is a creative extension of
existing libel laws.

Useful to know that.  Aachen is just down the road from here.
