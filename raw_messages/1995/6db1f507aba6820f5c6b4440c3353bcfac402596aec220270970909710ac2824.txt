Notice that Microsoft was flooded with complaints only after Rush Limbaugh
read it on his show...

The Reuters report said:
   Although U.S. District Court Judge Richard Stearns was critical of
   LaMacchia's actions, he ruled he could not be prosecuted under a wire fraud
   statute because it could result in a flood of actions against home computer
   users copying even single software programmes for their own use.

Anonymity had nothing to do with it. It was clear cut copyright law - which
wouldn't have hurt LaMacchia as he wasn't making anything out of it, so they
tried to hit him with wire fraud, and the Judge found _that_ untenable.
