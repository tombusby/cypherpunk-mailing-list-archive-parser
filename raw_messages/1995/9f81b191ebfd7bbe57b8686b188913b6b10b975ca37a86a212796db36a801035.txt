-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I have an anonymous remailer running at wmono@spook.alias.net - the domain
may or may not change (anybody have any suggestions?).  It runs Mixmaster
2.0.1 and Ghio2 to give both Type I and Type II support.  In the near
future, when I have some time on my hands, I will upgrade to Mix2.0.2.

This remailer is going public as of now.  I have sent this message to
cypherpunks, remailer-operators, and rops, so my appologies in advance
if you receive multiple copies.

Please add it to your pingers and cover-traffic generators.

Although I have tested this remailer a lot, I have only done so from two
accounts, therefore I am not certain of its reliability.  Hopefully any
such problems will be ironed out over the next few days.  For this reason,
I would advise against using it for sensitive materials for a week or so.
If you encounter any difficulties, please contact me at the remailer's
address.  Mail sent regarding the remailer to wmono@direct.ca (my main
addreess) will be ignored and/or deleted.

Type I remailer's default latency is set to 900 seconds (15 minutes) so add
a Latent-Time: +0:00 header if you want an immediate response.

The keys are below.
