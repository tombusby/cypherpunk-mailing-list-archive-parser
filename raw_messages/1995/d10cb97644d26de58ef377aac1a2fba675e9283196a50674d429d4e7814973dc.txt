	I am very confused.  I was not 'spouting off' in any
sense of the word.  Your comment refers to my apparent
lack of knowledge of the widespread practice of
wiretapping.  A practice, at least according to the sworn
testimony of agents of the FBI, is not very widespread at all.
	That is, however, beside the point.  I was making a
very truthful comment about the engineered capacity of the
telephone network in the U.S.  I made no comment
whatsoever about the current ability or desire of the FBI to
tap into individuals telephone conversations.
