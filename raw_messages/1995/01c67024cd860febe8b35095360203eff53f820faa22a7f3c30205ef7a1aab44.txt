Hmmm.  Did you come in late, or have you seen my posts about the crypto
library I'm working on ("Hastur Crypto Toolkit," nee "GUCAPI")?

AFAIK, RSA is the only feasible PK scheme available.  There's eliptic
curves, of course, but that's patented.

Needn't be block.  Stream cipher works perfectly well for the "fast crypto"
symetric cipher part.

Why a number?  When you can choose between a number and a human-readable
string (and space is not a big issue), choose human-readable.

Hmmm.   If the session key is a hash of a password, then why on Earth
would you include it?

We shouldn't be using ciphers that are vulnerable to "known plaintext"
attacks.  RSA is known to be vulnerable to "chosen plaintext" attacks
(see Schneier), but is useful enough that we work around this shortcoming
by RSA encrypting only hashes and session keys.

Naturally.  In fact, encoding, encryption, and compression are the same
thing: mapping one set of numbers into another.

As far I know, there are two standards: the PKCS #11 document from 
RSADSI, which I do not care to follow if I can avoid it.  The other
is the IETF GSSAPI, which should be accomodated.

In general, I very much agree with the thrust of what you're saying.
Which is why I'm folding the crypto work I already have to do for
my company into the larger "general solution" approach.

If you haven't read my postings on GUCAPI/Hastur, please go back and
take a look (send me mail if you'd like a copy).  It very much sounds
to me like you're addressing the same problem that I've been hacking
full-time for the last month or so.

If you're interested in helping, the best things that could possibly
be provided is code released to the public domain that implements:

	- Good random number generators for Macs and PCs, or
	- Implementations of the non-RSAREF symetric ciphers and hashes,
	 incl. IDEA, RC4, RC5, BLOWFISH, MD4, MD5, SAPPHIRE, GOST,
         SHA, LUC, and LOKI91.  Or any others that seem like a good idea.
	
I'll mention some miscellaneous features that will be in the library
that I haven't brought up yet:

	- It will be trivial to make the UNIX-style filter programs
	that Perry and Matt desire.
	- Specification of a format for outgoing and incoming messages
	will be trivial.  All known old formats (PGP 2.*, RIPEM, etc)
	will be supported by including format specs.

Key _management_ will *not* be supported, though public keys _will_
be imported from PGP and PEM key rings as well as X.509 certificates with
no judgement as to trust (see message from Eric Hughes from the middle
of last week).  Some key translation (x.509 --> PGP) services might be
provided.
