Yes, you can use CFS, which works on several versions of UNIX as well
as Linux.

Send email to cfs@research.att.com to get a copy. Someone exported
it, and it is also available from
ftp://ftp.hacktic.nl/pub/crypto/CRYPTOapps/cfs.1.3.tar.gz

There is also something called the "loop filesystem" for Linux. I haven't
tried it and don't know how well it would integrate into the newer
Linux kernels. ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/BETA/loop
