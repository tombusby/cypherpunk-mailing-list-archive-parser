MIT is pleased  to announce that it is   now distributing the BETA  TEST
release of PGPfone.

"PGPfone  (Pretty Good Privacy Phone) is   a software package that turns
your desktop  or notebook computer  into  a  secure telephone.  It  uses
speech  compression and strong cryptography  protocols  to give you  the
ability to have a real-time secure telephone conversation."

The  Beta Test  is only  currently available  for people  with Macintosh
computers. A Windows 95 version is also in the works.

We are distributing PGPfone in the U.S. and Canada via anonymous FTP and
via the World Wide Web.

Anonymous FTP  users   should get  the  file  "/pub/PGPfone/README" from
net-dist.mit.edu. It provides instructions on how to download PGPfone.

Web Users should go to the PGPfone Home Page at:

                   http://web.mit.edu/network/pgpfone
