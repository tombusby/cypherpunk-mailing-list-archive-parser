Exactly!

We haven't yet learned that small and commonly used set -- understandably,
since the field is so new.  I'd be willing to bet that association between
a key and a checking account would be on the list.  Beyond that, I don't
know.

Once an element of that set is identified, it can be assigned a codeword
(to make parsing easier).

For example, a general certificate might be:

- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Signing-Key-ID: f149b8e7e1f71e60964fff361dae2460
Signed-Key-ID: 76c68cb46a8e3de1509acaf4170feb10
Meaning: I have met this person, introduced to me as James, who signed
	with that key and I found him to be about 25 years old, roughly
	5'11" and with dark hair.  Beyond that I don't remember much.

- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
[...]   signature with the signing key
- -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----



While the specialized one might be:

- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Signing-Key-ID: bc2cb00144f223498fcc074eabb821d0
Signed-Key-ID: e05c601c4ec4af3aeb54a53171ed65da
Meaning: checking-account: 116 94265, First Security Bank

- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
[...]   signature with First Security Bank's key
- -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----



This format has several advantages over ASN.1, of course, but I won't
belabor that point here.
