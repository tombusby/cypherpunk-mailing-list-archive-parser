good!

It turns out you want seperate ports for each ssl-ized service because that way
the sysadmin types and the firewall guards are happy. They hate multiplexed
protocols because the standard off the shelf router equipment can't deal with
it.

You are right here. However, our observation is that an interesting chunk of
the world is moving towards using X.509 based certificate infrastructures for
many things. Everybody wants digital signatures and the related capabilities.
For more info, feel free to wade into the X.500 specs (not recommended for the
timid or weak of stomach :-), or go poke around on www.rsa.com and look into
their pkcs specs.

The implementation will be out very shortly (it's already done and working). It
will be free for non-commerical usage, so hopefully most of the cypherpunks
will be happy (if there is such a state of affairs mind you :^)

We won't be having any of the copy-leftish stuff that is in the RSAREF license
- like not fiddling with the api, and having to give us back your hacks using
it...Of course we want to hear about what people are doing with it (thats
another purpose for the ssl-talk mailing list).
