In one form or another, it's all on
ftp://hks.net/cypherpunks/{All,nntp/cypherpunks}.  Unfortunately, it's
quite a mess and is worth much unless 

A somewhat better alternate is NNTP:nntp.hks.net, by which the traffic
since June is all available under hks.lists.cypherpunks.

Getting a decent, web-searchable archive up is near the head of my 2nd
tier queue.
