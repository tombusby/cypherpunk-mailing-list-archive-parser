	"The Premier Cypherpunk ISP" now offers shell accounts at a
discount to those who will just telnet in and not use the dialup
pool. We are one of the only ISPs in the country who offers anonymous
shell accounts. (Payment in advance, of course.)
	Check out http://www.c2.org

	If you think our net is too slow right now, check back in
about a month.

	("Premier Cypherpunk ISP" is a bit of a joke, btw)
