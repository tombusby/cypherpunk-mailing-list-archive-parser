Not really.
        I saw the same story. The name, address, age, & height mentioned
are already obvious on licenses, but this may preclude incorrect data entry
by FL cops, and counterfeiting (a problem here for *years*). I saw nothing
on the digitized photo, but we could be looking at different stories.
Phase-in in July, '96. The story I saw suggests that other data, such as
tickets, criminal violations (presumably convictions) and "other
biographical information" [welfare, credit info] could eventually be
included, depending on FL's state budgetary considerations. No author,
just "Associated Press," listed on the story, and the card uses a magnetic
strip "like those on credit cards" rather than a chip, which may be a
mistake [considering the renewal period & my experience with bank-cards].
Story doesn't say it, but it sounds like FL *may* be the first state to do
this. Are any other states doing this already?
