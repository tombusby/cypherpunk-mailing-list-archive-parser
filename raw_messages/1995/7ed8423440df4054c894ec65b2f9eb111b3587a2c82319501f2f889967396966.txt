I do not believe that this is true.

Southwest Airlines has "open seating" on all of their flights, where you
board and then sit in any seat that you choose. (IMHO, an annoying policy)

When a flight is (close to) full, and the flight is running late, many
flight attendants will instruct the last few passengers to "sit in any open
seat". I have seen this on Reno Air, American, and United.
