Credit card fraud -- ie I've snarfed someone's card number and they 
haven't figured it out yet.

Cardholder's liability is $50 (I think).  Depending on the situation (if 
it's a card-is-physically-present transaction or a not-present) the 
liability falls to either the bank or the merchant.

A "proof of address" is a darn good way to reduce (not prevent, reduce) 
that sort of fraud.
