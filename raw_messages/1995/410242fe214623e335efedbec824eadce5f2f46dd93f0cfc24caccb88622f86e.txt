Your use of the word random is incorrect:  The throw of a dice is 
random, but only contains 2.6 bits of entropy.

The windows VDT counter is very far from being random, but 
contains roughly sixteen bits of entropy.

This is old term of the art, a term of information theory:  We use 
the same word because entropy in information theory has the same 
measure as entropy in thermodynamics.

In both cases the entropy, measured in bits, of an ensemble of 
possible states is sum of  - P(i) * lg[P(i)] over all the possible states.
