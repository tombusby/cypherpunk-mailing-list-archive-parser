It seems more likely that the opposite will occur: Clinton has been pandering
for the police vote so strongly that he's more likely to come up with more
draconian proposals to curry their favor.

One thing I'm hoping for is that Clinton will, as he contemplates his last
year and a bit in office, have an attack of "liberalism." That is, I am
hoping he realizes that any mandatory key escrow system is not only a
massive infringement on the right of people to speak and communicate as
they wish, it is also handing the keys to the Surveillance State to the
likes of Bob Dole, Jesse Helms, Alonse D'Amato, Newt Gingrich, and William
Bennett.
