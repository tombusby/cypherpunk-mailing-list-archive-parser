I've been reading through "Applied Cryptography," as every good boy
and girl should :) and one of the concepts struck out at me recently. 
The idea of the Chinese Lottery seemed to be rather far fetched in my
first few readings, but then I came across the discussion of the new
Emergency Broadcast System.

This may just be an unfair helping of paranoia, but the system seems
to be a  perfect distribution system for a Chinese Lottery-like
keychecking or cracking system. Even though the public can turn off the
broadcast, the signal will still be sent.  The chips may even be
government-regulated... available only from the government so no one can
tamper with the signal and use this system for their  own
information-disemination needs (*ahem* Political agendas *ahem*
re-election  ads).  They might even encrypt the signals, for a touch of
irony.  Anyone find fault in this?
