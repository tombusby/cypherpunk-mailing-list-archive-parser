Even with the exclusion of processors using single-source clocking for
interval and CPU timing, this would *seem* to be somewhat hazardous. Any two
clocking mechanisms that are 'mixed' are going to result in a number of
harmonics, or beat frequencies. While your system - at any given instant -
is quite likely to have a decent amount of randomness in it, I'd hazard a
guess that repetitive use would result in a discernible pattern. Even
something as 'coarse' as an interrupt timer has a finite range that it can
(must) operate in. Even if the CPU oscillator is based on a ceramic
resonator (nowhere near as stable/accurate as a crystal), the clock on it is
going to stay within +/-1% (worst case, for a *really* cheap oscillator) of
frequency, and drift not more than some number of Parts Per Million per
Period. Mixing the innate (relative) accuracy of two oscillators, and the
necessarily limited amount of drift that they're capable of, would seem to
result in an unacceptably low-yield source of 'real' randomness.

Of course, I'm kind of math-impaired when it comes to crypto, so my 20+
years of electronics (hardware) experience may not apply in this case :-)
