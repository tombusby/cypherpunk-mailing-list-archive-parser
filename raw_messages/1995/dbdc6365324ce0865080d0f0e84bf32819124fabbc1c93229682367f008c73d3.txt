I don't think there is one.  I would just use select() on FD, and then
a subrutine much like this:

sub syswrite {
    local($FH, $buf) = @_;

    local($len, $offset, $wlen) = (length($buf), 0, 0);

    while($len) {
        $wlen = syswrite($FH, $buf, $len, $offset);
        die "Bad write $FH: $!" if (!defined($FH));

        $offset += $len;
        $len -= $wlen;
    }
}


Actually if you can use perl5 for the server (I assume this is the
server code you are worrying about) I have code that deals with
I/O from multiple sockets at once and drives an independant state
machine for each socket.

For bi-directional pipes I tend to use sysread/syswrite anyway, but
you could just sprinkle "seek(SERVE, 0, 1)" liberally through the
code.

"date '+%s'" does it under BSDI, but I'm not sure how portable it is.
