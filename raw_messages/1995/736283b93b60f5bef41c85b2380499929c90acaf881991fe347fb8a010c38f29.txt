In the U.S. at least, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) says
that e-mail should not be looked at by third parties to a communication.
Yes, there are all sorts of wrinkles, such as whether an employer may look
at employee e-mail, blah blah. But I suspect the ECPA adequately protects a
mail deliverer against charges such as Mark describes.

("But under the ECPA I am not allowed to look at this e-mail, so how can I
held be liable for it?" Not even under Stratton-Oakmont is the deliverer or
holder of e-mail held liable for content or effects--the Prodigy case
involved the fact that Prodigy was moderating/censoring speech in public
forums, so, the judge averred, Prodigy could not claim it had no duty to
moderate or censor the speech of defamers. Roughly, as IANAL.)

Drives are cheap. I just saw a 1.2 GB for $195 (internal, PC). I suspect
that anyone sweating over having only a MB to spare shouldn't be running a
remailer.

(Not a slam against Mark, just a statement that there are certain minimal
capabilities I'd expect to see, and not having free disk space is a serious
problem.)

In any case, by the time "General Delivery Remailers" would be spreading,
disk space will be even cheaper. And a coupon- or stamp-based remailer
could of course then buy disk space as needed.

(If a 1000 MB drive costs $300 and is written off over 3 years, then the
storage cost is $0.10 per megabyte-year. For the average text message of
about 20 KB, the cost to store it a year is $0.002. The cost to store it
for 60 days is 6 times less. Even if disk drives cost more than I've
quoted, the cost is tiny, tiny, tiny. Connection costs are likely to
dominate. Large files may be a different matter--the math is easy to
do--but these are seldom the targets of remailers to unsuspecting parties.
In any case, easy to "expire" unretrieved larger files faster.)
