Well, the online newspaper is certainly information.

If you can do this, then you don't need an anonymous payment system, do
you? If you want to go through a trusted third-party escrow agent and
that agent doesn't know what you're buying, why do you need to hide what
you're spending it on? How is this different from the bank being the 
trusted third party holding your money in escrow anonymously?

If the escrow agent knows who you're buying from and who you're selling
to, you've lost the anonymity. If the escrow agent doesn't know what the 
goods are and doesn't know who is exchanging the goods, then you don't 
need to pay that agent anonymously.

I still think that at some point, either you have the money before the 
goods or the goods before the money. Basic Byzantine General problem, yes?
In addition, if it's online cash, I have to clear it with the bank before 
I know it's any good. I read the Certified Electronic Mail paper, and 
(while I didn't follow it all) I didn't see how that solved the problem.

And... how do you know? How do you know that the LLBean website that's 
taking your money *is* LLBean?  (Probably TM's in there somewhere.)
I can set up a web site, run it for three days, and walk off with a bunch 
of money, can't I? How can someone distinguish this from LLBean having 
shipping delays?

First Virtual assumes that the seller loses in the case of a dispute. 
Bearer instruments assume that the buyer loses in the case of a dispute.

That's assuming the business meant to stay in business in the first place.
Ever hear the one where you wheel the fake ATM machine into the mall for
one day?
