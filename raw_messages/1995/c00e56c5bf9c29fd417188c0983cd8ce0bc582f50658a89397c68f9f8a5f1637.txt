CURRENT U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY DIRECTIVES PUBLISHED

This announcement is likely to be of particular interest to
librarians, historians, and journalists specializing in government
documents, international affairs, military affairs and military
history, nuclear policy, outer space, and US trade and technology
policy.....

Thank you for letting me share this with you.

I've compiled an unusually complete collection of presidential
National Security Decision Directives from the administrations of
Ronald Reagan and George Bush (1981-1993). The collection is similar
in certain respects to the well known _Foreign Relations of the
United States_ (FRUS) series, but is far more current. The
declassified texts of more than 250 NSDD's are included; each text
has an introduction describing its origin and context; and there is
an extensive cross-index and subject index. The collection goes
considerably beyond the NSDDs available at the US National Archives
or in any other collection, because it includes verbatim texts of
directives that have been leaked  in whole or in part by the
administration, but not formally declassified. It also includes
tables of organization of the National Security Council. The new
collection's format also makes it much less expensive, and easier to
use, catalog and store than any comparable microform or hard copy
collection.

Major areas of coverage include:

++ management of US national security policy, covert operations,
weapons procurement, arms control negotiations, and anti-terrorism
policies;

++ US relations with Israel, Europe, USSR, China, Australia,
Nicaragua, Mexico, Central America, East Africa, Japan, Germany,
Southeast Asia, Micronesia, Libya, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, the
Philippines, Yugoslavia, South Africa and Namibia, etc., etc.

++ nuclear weapons procurement and testing, nuclear arms control;
internal debates over SALT, ABM, START, SDI and related matters;
civil defense and FEMA;

++ Space policy, privatization of space assets, NASA-DOD conflicts,
space and aerospace procurement;

++ Trade policy with Japan, G-7 summits, technology transfer,
export controls, economic warfare, subsidies for strategic US
industries;

++ Telecommunications and computer policy, including technology
security policies;

++ drugs and US foreign policy;

++ the Iran-Contra affair and its aftermath;

++ internal security and emergency continuity of government policies;

++ war with Iraq;

and much more.
