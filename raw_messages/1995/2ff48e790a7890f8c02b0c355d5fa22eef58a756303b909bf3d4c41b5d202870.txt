This, of course, is the rationale for the "key escrow" systems (as opposed
to the government-mandated "key escrow" proposals, which are not an
"escrow" sytem of this kind).

"Escrow" is sufficiently overloaded with real estate connotations that I
wish the industry would adopt a different term. Carl Ellison's "GAK" is
cute, but is hardly likely to ever be adopted widely.

(No, I'm not calling for another round of suggested names, just opining
that "key escrow" is a terrible name.)
