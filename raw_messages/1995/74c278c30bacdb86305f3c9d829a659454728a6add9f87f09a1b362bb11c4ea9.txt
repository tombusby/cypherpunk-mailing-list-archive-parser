	Picking a few nits:

	Putting the UPC's on things other than cards (such as books)
makes it easier to hide in the open.  `UPC' stickers on, say, a few
books are easier to miss than UPC stickers on index cards.

	Invisible ink draws attention to the correct UPC's once they
know you're using it.  See Kahn for a discussion of secret inks being
developed during the second world war.  If you want to hide bits, they
should be stripped of low entropy parts and hidden with a stego
program.
