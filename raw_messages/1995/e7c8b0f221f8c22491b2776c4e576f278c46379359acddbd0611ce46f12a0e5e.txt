Ive tried this url, it does indeed core dump.

Just had a quick look at the core.  From first impressions, it's a global
overwrite.  Therefore we're not overwriting a flushed stack frame, so a
syslog(3) style exploit is impossible.

Global overwrites can be exploited, but due to the scenario we're looking
at, I'd consider exploit chances to be very low indeed.

Cheers,

Neil
