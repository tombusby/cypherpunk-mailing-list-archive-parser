   Jeffrey T. Richelson has a new book:

   A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century.
   Oxford University Press, New York, 1995, 534 pp., $30.00.
   ISBN 0-19-507391-6.

   Jacket copy: "Richelson covers the crucial role of spy
   technology from the days of Marconi and the Wright Brothers
   to today's dazzling array of Space Age satellites,
   aircraft, and ground stations. He provides portraits of
   spymasters, spies and defectors ... the 'black magic' of
   U.S. and British codebreakers. A final chapter probes the
   still-evolving role of intelligence in the new world of
   disorder and ethnic conflict, from the high-tech wonders of
   the Gulf War to the surprising involvement of the French
   government in industrial espionage."

   Blurb: "This is the missing book -- the primer -- on the
   craft of intelligence. It is a highly informed briefing,
   set in historical persepctive, by the best of the spy
   watchers." -- William E. Burrows, author of "Deep Black."

   --

   Watchers of spy watchers will recall Richelson's excellent,
   "The U. S. Intelligence Community," and other fine work on
   spy satellites and Soviet intelligence.
