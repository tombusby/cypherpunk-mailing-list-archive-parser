Many years ago I obtained a US account by mail
from overseas, using cheques made out to me from 
US sources.

I did this with the bank of America.  No big problem.  But as
time went by, their ability to handle financial events that were
out of the ordinary deteriorated spectacularly.

Perhaps this is partly because things tightened up, but
it is also that most US banks have developed a monolithic 
and obstructionist bureaucracy that is incapable of handling 
any event that is out of the ordinary.

By and large, over the past twenty years, there has been a 
decisive move towards financial management by guys who could 
not find their ass with both hands.


US banks simply do not work well for international transactions.

The problem is not so much money laundering laws as intolerable
ignorance, provincialism, and incompetence.

If you insist that international transactions be mediated through 
US banks, you are cutting your throat.

Go look for banks that are truly international.  You will not
find them in America.
