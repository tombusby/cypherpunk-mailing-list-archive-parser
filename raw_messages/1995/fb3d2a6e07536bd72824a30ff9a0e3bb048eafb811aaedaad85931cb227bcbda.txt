So Gleick wants to unleash the Justice Department to protect his ISP from
Microsoft's competition.  Can't cut it without Big Brother's help, eh?  

All I've got to say about this piece of commie trash is GM, ATT, IBM, USSR,

It took me all of 10 seconds to figure out how to delete the icons for the
MSN and MS' Internet Browser from my WIN95 desktop.  The help message that
popped up when I did this also told me how I could delete the actual
programs from my hard drive.  (Hint James try clicking the *right* mouse
button.)
