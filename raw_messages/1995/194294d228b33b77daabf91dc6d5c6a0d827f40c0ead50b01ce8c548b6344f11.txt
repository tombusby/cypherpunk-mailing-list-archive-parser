!!!  As far as I know, Cyberia-L isn't accessable via http from us.  Please
let me know if it is...if so something's very misconfigured.

The nntp part is correct, though.  And a bunch of the lists might soon be
added to the http archives: cypherpunks is the test message base for it.

>Now send them some of the money you're going to make from the stock market.

That'd be way nice...  Small unmarked bills are preferred.
