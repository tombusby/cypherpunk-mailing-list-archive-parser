	 MADRID, Dec 3 (Reuter) - U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
European Union leaders signed on Sunday a so-called New 
Transatlantic Agenda intended as a blueprint for Euro-American 
relations into the 21st century.  

	 The document encompasses cooperation on trade, security, 
human rights, aid, democracy, health care and crime-fighting 
among other subjects.
