Subject: interesting problem with remailers
Message-ID: <199501160203.VAA07586@sentinel.synapse.net>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


I need a good dependable cypherpunk style anomymous remailer. So I have been 
experimenting with a few.
I have discovered a rather curious problem. I have sent test messages to 
homer@rahul.net. These test messages read as follows:

::
Request-Remailing-To: myname@mydonain
Subject: Test

this is line1
this is line2
this is line3
this is line4
this is line5
this is line6

I have encrypted this message with the public key of homer@rahul.net using the 
pgp -ea command (for armour). This yields something like:

-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----
version 2.6.2

blahblahblah
blah blah
blah blah etc.....
------END PGP MESSAGE---

I have then put
::
Encrypted: PGP
<blank line>
 
at the beginning of the message and send it with Eudora PC 1.4.
Now curiously enough the message that I received back from homer@rahul is the 
following:

*************************************************************
To: myname@mysite
From: nobody@rahul.net
Subject: Test
Remailed-By: A Free Zone Remailer V1.2 <homer@rahul.net>
Complaints-To: Homer Wilson Smith <homer@rahul.net>
X-Comments: 
X-Comments:       finger homer@rahul.net for instructions.
X-Comments: 
X-Comments: Unauthorized or illegal use of this remailer, especially
X-Comments: for spamming the internet or posting copyright violations
X-Comments: will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
X-Comments: Homer Wilson Smith  (607) 277-0959, Fax: (607) 277-8913
X-Comments:                FULL HEADER LOGGING IS: ON

This is line1
this is line3
this is line5
*************************************************************

No this is line2
no this is line4
no this is line6

I am unable to explain this. Obviously the message must be recieved intact by 
the remailer because being encrypted with PGP if it were corrupt in anyway it 
would simply not decode properly and I would get no reply whatsoever. Now 
before somebody says that the trouble is at my site, I also have an account on
CI$ (compuserve). The same thing happens to message I received there. So 
obviously it cannot be my site. Unless I am doing something that somehow tells 
the remailer to only remail one line out of two. (?????)
And this problem is not only with homer@rahul. Other remailers do the same.
I know that it most be something that I am doing but it escapes me what. Again 
it must receive the PGP message correctly. I am stumped....
If anybody can help explain this little mystery, it would be most appreciated.

Please reply here at cypherpunks@toad.com and also forward to
wizard@alpha.c2.org (to see if it works)

Thanks all
