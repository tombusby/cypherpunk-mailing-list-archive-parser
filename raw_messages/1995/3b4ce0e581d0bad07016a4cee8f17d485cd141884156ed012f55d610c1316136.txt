You should consider that there are people with a lot of expertise that are
constantly on the lookout for things like this.  I would bet a nickel to
a donut that many people in the cracker community discovered this a long
time ago and that exploit code was written long ago.  How many people 
logged in as root use netscape?

If the source was available we'd have told them about this long ago.
