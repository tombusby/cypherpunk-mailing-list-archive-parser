Not really, not until a huge number of hosts carry it as a newsgroup.
As for why cypherpunks isn't a newsgroup... IMO, it would end up carrying
too much traffic and be way too high profile.

As is, the people who really want to find it will and a hordes of riff-raff
(not all, mind you) are less likely to bother with it.
