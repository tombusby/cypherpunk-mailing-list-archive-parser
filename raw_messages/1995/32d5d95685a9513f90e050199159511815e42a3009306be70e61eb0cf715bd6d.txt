On the request of a few law-related professors and other faculty, I'm
trying to put together a web page that brings together resources from all
over the net that are related to issues of free speech, privacy, libel,
censorship, etc. 

If you have a few URLS with materials related to the above, I'd 
appreciate it if you could drop them in an emailee to me.  Basically, any 
URL that ends up pointing to issues of rights and rules on the net, and 
possibly related software (such as PGP and the like).

Thanks much :-)
