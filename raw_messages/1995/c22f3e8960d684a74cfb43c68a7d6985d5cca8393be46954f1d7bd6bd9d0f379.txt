Will it ever sink in that NO algorithm produces a "random" bitstring, and
therefore NO algorithm can be the driver of a one time pad?

The output of an algorithm is (at best) PSEUDOrandom.  While a stream
cypher constructed that way may be strong, it is NOT a one time pad and
does NOT share with one time pad the unique property of being absolutely
unbreakable from first principles.  (It may very well have the property that
it is too hard to break in practice -- if so it makes a useful cryptosystem.
But to call such a thing "OTP" indicates a fundamental misunderstanding.)

See the sci.crypt FAQ for more details.

No, however the output of "pgp +makerandom=XXX filename.dat" _IS_
random enough for an OTP.  The problem then becomes distributing this
data.
