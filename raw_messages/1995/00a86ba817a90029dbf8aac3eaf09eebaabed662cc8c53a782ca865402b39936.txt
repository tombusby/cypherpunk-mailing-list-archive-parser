HP's web site at <http://www.hp.com> has more info on the cards 
and the related "international cryptographic platform" being 
crippled and begged and groveled to USG for export.


Try the site's search feature for "encryption" to poke around 
HP's various products, where some of the crypto to be employed 
is cited, if hypocryptically.
