Hello cypherpunks@toad.com

It seems to me that there are two viewpoints, 
  * a spokesman would be useful, and
  * a spokesman cannot be appointed due to lack of org

Which both seem to be true to me (they are *not* contradictory, only
the consequences are).


How about this idea: I remember once seeing some piece on some TV
personality (sorry, don't remember who, long time ago) who was
interviewed by fax. The jounalist sent questions to him, and some
time later received answers.

All that is needed then is someone with a fax machine to volunteer
to receive the fax, type it in and summarise the response afterwards
(noting points on which there was disagreement, and who disagreed
in what way).

Except PGP skill doesn't equal PR skill, not to mention that there
might be a geographical, time-zone or language barrier.

Sometimes having a separate PR person is useful, even if it does
tend to lead to the moronic statements salesdroids are infamous for.
With care, this problem can be minimized.

Not all PGP is done in those areas. You might want to have a SpokesPunk
near a focus to avoid having to get the people who actually do the work
to one of the abovementioned foci.

It's in our interest to give them such catchy quotes, no?
Unless it would destroy us, of course...

Only problem is, does anyone know of any other way to get our
ideas to be accepted by Joe Sixpack?

But then wouldn't that journalist act as a SpokesPunk?

Would you support such a jounalist writing about Cypherpunks?

What is the essential difference between a jounalist writing an
article and a volunteer writing a press release?

...

A well-written press release could reflect that.

For example, some points could be presented in two ways (perhaps
even contradictory) with full attribution of who wrote which view.

Those who oppose the whole idea could be noted in the press release :-)
Unless they object to that in which case they wouldn't be.


Yes, No, Maybe? Definite Maybe?
