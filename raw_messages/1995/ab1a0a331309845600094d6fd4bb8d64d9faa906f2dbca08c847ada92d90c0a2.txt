It's one of Sameer's remailers in a box. It's a modification of Hal Finney
and Eric Hughes' code. I believe it supports cpunk, hash and pgp. Here's a
copy of the readme file.

           The Cypherpunks Anonymous Remailer In a Box
                             Version 1.1
             Installer: Sameer <sameer@soda.berkeley.edu>
   Remailer: Eric Hughes & Hal Finney, with minor modifications by Sameer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        This is the remailer in a box installation system. If you'd like
to install a remailer on your c2.org account, just run the install_remail
program found in /usr/local/lib/boxed-remailer.

        The anonymous remailer uses the .forward file to pipe all mail
to the remailer system. If mail to the remailer account is not acted
upon by the remailer software, it goes to wherever mail should go
based on what the .forward file said before the remailer was
installed.

    GNU General Public License for more details.

        Once the remailer is installed run the program "remailer_remove"
which will be installed in ~/bin if you'd like to remove the remailer.
(It's also in /usr/local/lib/boxed-remailer.)
