                        Tuesday, November 7, 1995

Win Treese is Director of Security and Advanced Technology for Open
Market, Inc., a startup company building systems and software for
electronic commerce on open networks.  Before joining Open Market, he
was a member of the research staff at the Cambridge Research
Laboratory of Digital Equipment Corporation, where he worked on a
variety of projects, including the design and implementation of
Digital's Internet firewall system and the AudioFile network audio
system.

Win says:

>"Electronic commerce" is a short name for a big topic. In this talk I
>will describe Open Market's Transaction Management System and other
>components that can be used in many different applications, such as
>ordering of retail products for delivery, subscription access to
>information, "pay-per-page" purchasing of information, and others. In
>addition to payment, I will discuss other issues that arise in
>commerce, such as customer service and content management.


This meeting of the Boston Society for Digital Commerce will be held on
Tuesday, November 7, 1995 from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of the
Harvard Club of Boston, One Federal Street. The price for lunch is $27.50.
This price includes lunch, room rental, and the speaker's lunch. ;-).  The
Harvard Club *does* have a jacket and tie dress code.

We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or if we *really* know
you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by Saturday,
November 4 (that's one week from this Saturday), or you won't be on the list
for lunch. Checks payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will
have to be sent back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, c/o The Shipwright Development
Corporation, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they
must be made payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston".

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've had
to work with a few glacial A/P departments ourselves, for instance), please
let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something out.


November's speaker will be Art Hutchinson of Northeast Consulting Resources,
Inc.


We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on the
first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a presentation to the
Society, please send e-mail to the BSDC Program Commmittee care of Robert
Hettinga, rah@shipwright.com .
