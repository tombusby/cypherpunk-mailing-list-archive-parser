Here is my usually plea to anyone designing a computer telephony
application that uses modems: please always include a low bandwidth codec!
I am on a brand new DMS-100 and have new lines running from the CO to my
house. I can still not go over 9600bps. My only alternative is ISDN, which
isn't just another $150, but $1000. Please give the user a choice of
codecs that allows for minimization of the requirenments alony _any_ of
the three axis of the perfomance cube.
