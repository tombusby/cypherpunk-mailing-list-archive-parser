It would be Really Nice if the next version of the brutessl software had a
couple of features (particularly for us folks with mini-LANs) -

        > option to output results to a file (or files, so we can maintain
local logging of results: ie, CHAL2a.dat, CHAL2b.dat, etc).
        > a Windows 3.1 variant (or even win32s)

I've got 3 machines (386sx-33, 386DX-20, 486DX2-80), with an option on my
roommates machine (386DX-40), all connected via Windows for Workgroups. All
4 are set up with win32s, so could do a *lot* better at keysearches if the
software was available. There's plenty of support for Unix variants, and
even NT/95, but us humble Win/DOS users are kinda left hanging a bit.

Maybe next challenge, we can pre-allocate keyspace based on the results of
this one: look at how fast folks are reporting results, and allocate chunks
of space accordingly (maybe based on an 8-hour 'cycle'). Sure take some of
the load off the poor server :-)
