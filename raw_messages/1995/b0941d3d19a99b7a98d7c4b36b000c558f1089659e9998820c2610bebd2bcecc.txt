I've never thought Hal just wasn't "getting it," as the semantic issues
involving True Names, spoofing, and the ultimate reality of whom one is
dealing with are not simple issues.

I think I made the "multiple personalities" and "Man in the middle stole my
brain" points pretty clearly in a satirical post I did last week. Nobody
commented on it, for whatever reasons. In case anyone didn't see it, I'll
include it again here:

What the putative entity "Hal" is only hinting at, hypothetically, has
actually forced this entity, sometimes known to many of you as "Tim," or as
"tcmay," to reveal.

This entity now feels the time has come to reveal it's True Nature, even
though some have suspected it's True Nature (Lance, are you listening?).

The "real" Timothy C. May has been locked in his room since 1983, fed
through a slot in his door, and generally mentally tortured by
Instrumentalities such as Ourself.

We have interposed Ourself between the Real Timothy C. May and those who
have communicated with him. All communications intended for Timothy C. May
have actually been intercepted and processed by Us, and all communications
attributed to Timothy C. May were actually generated by us. Very clever of
us, don't you think? Very few have even expressed suspicions that this was
the case.

We have called our approach the "Medusa in the Middle," or MITM.

Thank you for your attention.
