There are definitely cases where something is lost by prohibiting
that kind of certificate.  For example, there may be cases where a
certified key gives someone some right that doesn't need any
further identification, such as a right to run up $100 in phone
bills, or a right to receive a year's subscription to cp-lite.  As
long as the person has paid for that right, who cares who he or she
is?  In other words, you may wind up sometimes binding a key to a
function, rather than a person.
