Ah, yes, I wish I were "(c) Both of the above" -- as the Sinatra lyric
sez, "When I was seventeen, it was a very WiReD year..."

I think generalizing about "Wired" is like generalizing about the NY
Times, where Markoff and Lewis arguably exemplify the best and worst
of mainstream computer/telecom journalism.  "Wired" has many flaws, but
I consider Steven Levy's articles about Cypherpunks, Whitfield Diffie,
and digital cash to be among the best expositions of Cypherpunk issues
for the layperson.  (Kelly's "Whole Earth Review" piece is another.)

I can forgive some faults in return for seeing Levy's non-technical
explanations of public-key crypto and the Dining Cryptographers protocol
in successive issues. :-)
