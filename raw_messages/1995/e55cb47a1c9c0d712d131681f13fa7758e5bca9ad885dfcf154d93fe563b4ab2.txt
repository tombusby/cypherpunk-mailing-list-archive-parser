Proposed extension:

SHTBD/<agent>

eg:

There's a paedophile on the Internet! SHTBD/PTB!

PTB're trying to regulate cyberspace! SHTBD/EFF!

PTB're pushing GAK! SHTBD/C'punks!

And so on. After all, all sides can cry "SHTBD", can't they?


(Home users may prefer the alternate syntax SHTBD\<agent>, ie
SHTBD\PTB, SHTBD\EFF, SHTBD\C_PUNKS etc :-)

How about something like:
"I was not implying that SHTBD/PTB to stop it, but that SHTBD/us to
support it/deploy it/get ready for it."

Hence the addition of the <agent> field...

Yet one of your examples implied the opposite - sorry, I nuked it, but
it was about the media picking bogeymen.

Fortunately for the anarchists, perhaps, an authoritarian government
is isomorphic to anarchy.
