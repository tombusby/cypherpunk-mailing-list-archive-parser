I think you're probably right, though a one-way secure channel is enough.
If Alice has a trusted copy of the Bank's key, she can open her account and 
get her key certified by them without them having to trust her key (modulo 
little details like government requirements that banks get positive 
identification for their accountholders.)

With online clearing, you'd be able to tell because Alice's check cleared
and your bank (which we're assuming you've got a secure channel to)
says you've got the money.  Or in the case of digicash, because the cash
Alice's bank gave you was good.

Maybe not, but it would sure help.

Hmmm.  That one's interesting; he pays fakes everything for a while,
including paying out money, and then pulls off the Big Con.

Agreed.
