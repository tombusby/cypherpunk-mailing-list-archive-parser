Assuming that the International Traffic in Arms Regulations are the
law (rather than the unconstitutional silliness that they actually
are), this consensus is correct.  The ITAR forbid the ``disclosure''
of cryptographic ``software''--very broadly defined--to ``foreign''
persons ``within or without the United States.''  It says nothing
about the medium of the disclosure: whether it is a T-shirt or
computer screen.
 
: The _reality_ is quite different, I think, and the "this shirt is illegal"
: hype is, in my opinion, just that, hyperbole. Even hyperbull, too.
: 
: Books and written articles containing crypto algorithms are _not_ illegal
: for "furriners" to look at. The t-shirt contains at most a fuzzy printing
: of an algorithm that has been widely printed in various books and in
: articles in mailing lists like ours.
 
The fact that the government does not dare to try to enforce the ITAR
against those who publish cryptographic software without a license (and
the fact that the Office of Defense Trade Controls has waived its jurisdiction
to require a license in one case for a book where it retained
jurisdiction for a CDrom with the same information) does not mean that
it is not a violation of the ITAR to publicly wear a T-shirt with
cryptographic software on it; although it does strongly suggest that
no one will be prosecuted for such violations.

And that is just as well, since the posting on an anonymous FTP server
of the C program that cracks the seed for the Netscape security routines
is also a technical violation of the ITAR, as even Mr. May will
perhaps concede.  The fact that warning the world of this security
breach is a violation of the ITAR simply shows how silly--and how
dangerous--is the ITAR's licensing scheme for the publication
of cryptographic software.

: (I agree that there are some unresolved issues with ostensibly

: plausible interpretation of machine-readable.)

There is nothing in the ITAR that refers to ``machine-readable'' so
there is no need to interpret that term.
