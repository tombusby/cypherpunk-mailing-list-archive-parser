Because Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act which 
is codified, as amended, at 18 U.S.C. Section 2510 et seq.  Section 
2511(2)(a)(ii) states in part:  "Notwithstanding any other law, providers 
of wire or electronic communication service ... are authorized to provide 
information, facilities, or technical assistance to persons authorized by 
law to intercept wire, oral, or electronic communications ... if such 
provider ... has been provided with [a court order or a certification by 
an appropriate official that a court order isn't required ...].

Sorry.  

In subsection B of the the statute I quoted above, it states in 
part:  "No provider of wire or electronic communication service ... shall 
disclose the existence of any interception ... with respect to which the 
person has been furnished a court order or certification ... except as 
may be otherwise required by legal process and then only after prior 
notification to the Attorney General or ....  Any such disclosure shall 
render such person liable for the civil damages provided for in section 
2520.  No cause of action shall lie against in any court against any 
provider ... for providing information ... in accordance with the terms 
of a court order or certification under this chapter." 

Thus providing evidence of that one of the uses of lawyers is to [attempt 
to close loopholes.
