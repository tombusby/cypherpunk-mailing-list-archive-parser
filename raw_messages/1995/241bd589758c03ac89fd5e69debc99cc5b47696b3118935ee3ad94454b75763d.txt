  Greetings! I'd like to solicit your/our best thoughts on the following
message. San Francisco State University is considering a policy of
"disclosing" private email to outside agencies.  I'm aware that such a
policy is yet another argument for using crypto; and the last cypherpunks
meeting gave some encouraging instances of "transparent" encryption
schemes that are not a hassle or a fear-barrier for newbies. 
  But if you could post or private email me your thoughts about the 
legal/ethical aspects of "disclosure," I'd be much obliged.
  I've put a few of my own concerns at the end of the enclosed quote.

   I'm uneasy about the chain of "prior notice":
  
   1) Does this policy give university administrators the power to read
private email before the decision is made to "disclose" it to outside
persons or agencies? 
 
   2) Does this "prior notice" mean "We're going to do it" or "We plan to do 
it, and if you disagree, let's discuss it before we release it"?
   
   3) What constitutes "inappropriate"?
