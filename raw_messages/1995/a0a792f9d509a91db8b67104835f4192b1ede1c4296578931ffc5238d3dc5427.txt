Assume we have good public key steganography tools (I am not
aware of such tools.)

The recipient would have to scan a large pile of random 
pictures in the hope that some of the messages, when 
decoded using his private key, decoded into a correctly
formatted message.

Although prearrangement is needed, otherwise he would not 
be scanning this pile of random graphics for secret messages, 
he does not know whether he will receive a message or not, 
and no one else can know if he has received a message or not.

For example:

  "I have plutonium and bondage pictures of nine year old girls
   for sale"   My public key is 7uL623uvGjg8N-u7hO789HcysFhGyvcAgyh
   Interested parties should post replies stegoed into images
   posted on 
   alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.blondes.dinosaurs.oral.fetish.waifs

   Please use only new dirty pictures to hide your message in --
   not images I have already seen.
  "

Then people can post replies without anyone knowing they are
posting encrypted messages.
