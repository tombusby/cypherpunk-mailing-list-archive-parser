Before looking at the address information I was going to send a one line: "Go away" reply to the question. I thought you promised to try to be less obnoxious. If you'd calm down and read the list for a while you might realize why this might not be the place to pose such questions. Why not take a look at the newsgroup alt.2600? You might find it a rather rude place to frequent and I'd certainly never send my 13 year old there (my oldest is currently 8) but I get the impression the topics you'd find there might prove more interesting than the political and/or technical discussions you'll find here. By all means enjoy yourself here but spend more time listening.
