The message below (posted earlier today) caught my attention - I believe it
is a (fake?) MITM-generated message, because Tim's sig file has changed
recently (new domain name (got.net) and a disclaimer was added). The sig
attached to this anonymous message is at least a month out of date.

Even if this isn't just a mistake, it's not a true MITM attack, since this
is a third party /not/ between Tim and toad.com ... more of a spoof.

Do I win anything?

This key isn't registered with the MIT keyserver; not proof in any sense,
but worth mentioning.
