When you want to sign a key, you should use "pgp -ks".  You should
never clearsign a public key -- it buys you absolutely nothing other
than saying that "I saw this key at some point, and this message
(which is a public key block) came from me".  

Have you signed your own key using "pgp -ks"?  Have you extracted your
key (using "pgp -kxa") since you signed it?  Or did you only extract
it before you signed it?  This would be the cause of the confusion.

If you sign a key, the signature gets attached to the key certificate.
However you do not need that signature in order to _use_ the key.  So,
people to whom you gave your key without a signature can still use
that key, it just doesn't have your signature on it.

As for the keyserver, it _ONLY_ accepts keys; if you clearsign your
key before you send it, then you are not sending a key, you are
sending a message that contains a key.  This is not the same thing.
That is why the keyserver rejected it.

If you performed the pgp -ks, then you should re-perform the pgp -kxa
and distribute the newly extracted key.

I hope this answers all your questions.  All of this, and more, should
be explained in the PGP Documentation which is included with PGP.

Good Luck.
