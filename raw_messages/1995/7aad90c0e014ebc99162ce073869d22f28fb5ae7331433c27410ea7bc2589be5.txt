I realize I'm a little late in this thread, but I'm pretty far behind in my
e-mail.  I oversimplify here, but what's new.

Anyway, all I wanted to say is that treaties are *not* superior to acts of
Congress, as far as I know (they do override state law).  I'm not an
international lawyer, but it was held long ago that a properly ratified
treaty is "equivalent to an act of the legislature."  Foster v. Neilson, 27
U.S. (2 Pet.) 253, 314 (1829) (Marshall, C.J.).  Note also that a treaty is
not necessarily self-executing; if it requires appropriation of funds,
Congress needs to act again.  Whether Congress may decline to implement is
unclear.  

Finally, the Supreme Court has also held that when there is conflict
between an Act of Congress and a treaty, "the last expression of the
sovereign will must control."  The Chinese Exclusion Case, 130 U.S. 581
(1889).  

Treaties may still bind the U.S. internationally, putting the U.S. in
default.  But a U.S. person would not be able to enforce any treaty-based
claim if a later U.S. law conflicts, at least in a U.S. court.

P.S.  I'm not aware of telecom treaties that would shield one from ITAR
violations, but would be interested to know of any.  I generally refrain
from public comment on ITAR because we are in litigation, as most of you
know.
