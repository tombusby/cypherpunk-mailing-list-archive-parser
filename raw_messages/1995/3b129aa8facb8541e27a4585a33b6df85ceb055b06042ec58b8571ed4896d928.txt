     To all.  This is something I received from a fellow Internet user in 
     the States.  I don't know where he got this info, but I thought we may 
     all benefit from this warning.

>>>>>>      The FCC  released a warning last Wednesday concerning a 
>>>>>>matter of  major  importance  to  any  regular  user  of  the 
>>>>>>Internet.     Apparently  a   new  computer  virus  has  been

>>>>>>such as  "Stoned",  "Airwolf"  and  "Michaelangelo"  pale  in

>>>>>>the FCC,  is the  fact that  no program needs to be exchanged 
>>>>>>for a  new computer to be infected.  It can be spread through 
>>>>>>the existing e-mail systems of the Internet.  Once a computer

>>>>>>reading "Good  Times".   Avoiding infection  is easy once the
