   "Spies Unlike Us: A history of French intelligence reveals
   a far more brutal approach than this country's."

      The aftermath of 1945 imposed an additional heavy burden
      on the French secret services. Political allegiances
      were exacerbated by the presence of a potential huge
      Communist fifth column in France. The rough lessons of
      the war led to a premium on "service action" operations
      of sabotage and assassination before which Britain's
      M.I.6 would have quailed. Mr. Porch sees the French
      secret services of today as still not having recovered
      from their politicization during World War II. During
      the gulf war, the humiliating realization was forced on
      the French Army that for intelligence it was totally
      dependent on American high technology.         SAL_mai


   "The Code War: How United States intelligence outsmarted
   Japan in World War II."

      He rightly sees the role of intelligence in the Pacific
      war not simply as a story of code-breaking successes.
      Rather, he writes, "the true achievements of
      intelligence in the Pacific war lie in the day-to-day
      accumulation of a fund of knowledge.... Cryptography,
      traffic analysis, aerial photography, prisoner
      interrogation, document capture and translation, and
      technical intelligence ... became pillars of an overall
      effort greater than the sum of its parts." He explains
      and describes this winning synergy of intelligence
      elements as well as, or better than, any previous
      author.                                        PIL_sal
