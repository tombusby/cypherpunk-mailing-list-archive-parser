He seems to think so...  He is so assured as to the security of his system.
I am going to ask if I can post his challenge he made to me in private
e-mail here.  He needs to be taught some basics in security.  (I do not have
the proper hardware to subvert his scheme.  I do have some other ways of
subverting it, but that would be telling...  (I occasionally assist with the
web server on Teleport.  Changing his script to collect information would
not be difficult...))

I will see if he will let me forward his e-mail to the list.  (I will also
check with the webmistress on Teleport before I do...  She might get pissed
if I turned the people on the list onto Teleport's server.)
