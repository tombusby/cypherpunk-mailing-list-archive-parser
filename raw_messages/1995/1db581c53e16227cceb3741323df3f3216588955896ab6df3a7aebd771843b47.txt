Why not do both?  A Zener is supposed to be a relatively high-level source
of white noise, up to some upper bandwidth, so you could just feed the Zener
voltage (through a blocking cap, if necessary) to the radio receiver input.

See, you and the chip manufacturer are working at crossed purposes:  a radio
receiver chip is SUPPOSED to be a low-noise device.  For your purposes, you
WANT it to be a high-noise device, to minimize the significance of external
noise.  Since the radio receiver chip does some things you want (gain, maybe
AGC), but doesn't necessarily add an adequate amount of noise, a zener would
be an excellent addition.
