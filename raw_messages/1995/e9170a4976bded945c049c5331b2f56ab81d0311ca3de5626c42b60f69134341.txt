The Netscape "personal edition" was available in Europe on some store
shelves soon after it's release.  (The PE edition of netscape has the 128
bit encryption.)

As for what Netscape will do in this case...  They had made plans to release
the 128 bit version in a method similar to what MIT uses, but they found
that they could actually get people to buy a copy if they kept that one as
only available by ordering it.  (Who says that people will not pay for
encryption?)  Now all they need to do is come out with a version with a
bigger key. (Hint, hint...)

I will keep my personal feelings about Netscape to a minimum here.  There
are certain things that they do well and there are others they do not.  But
those problems will continue to be forwarded to Dave Null... 

Well, on to more profitable things.
