Agreed.  My annoyance with Netscape is not based solely, or even primarily,
on security concerns.  In fact, my only annoyance with your security
proposal is that it is at the wrong layer (or, more accurately, at layer
which should be secondary).  In my view, you picked the right technology,
but applied it to the wrong problem :).

> Clearly I'm an idiot. Explain it to me.

SSL is a mechanism whereby a client and a server can establish a secure,
authenticated transport channel.  The problem is that this isn't what I want 
to secure and authenticate.  Most of the time, in fact, I don't care about
the transport: I may be talking through a proxy (like the current CERN httpd), 
or bringing things in from a cache, or talking to a load-balanced server 
array.  I want the *documents* I'm accessing to be secure and/or 
authenticated.  I want my HTML documents signed and certified by the *author*, 
not the server.  I couldn't care less about the server if I can verify that 
I've got the right document in response to my query.  Similarly, if I send the 
contents of a form containing, say, my Amex number, I want to encrypt the 
session key with the public key of the merchant, not the service provider.

This is what I (and many others) mean by an "end to end security model."
Transport security is a nice secondary ability (it helps defend against 
traffic analysis, for example, and casual snooping by students with packet 
sniffers), but without end-to-end security, it's simply a way of providing a 
false sense of security.  I wouldn't want to do away with the TCP checksum 
field simply because the modem I use for my SLIP link is "error-correcting," 
and I feel the same way about security.

> I put my email address in there for that very reason. Jeesh.

I'd rather that technical feedback occur in a public forum like the IETF.
I have no pretensions about being a security expert, and I want people to 
shoot down my bad ideas too.  Heck, I *like* having my competitors tell me 
what's wrong with my ideas :).

Nope, not if I want to sell it (note the word "commercial" in my comment).
RSAREF cannot be used for commercial software, nor can IDEA under the PGP 
license.  There is no feasible way to license the RSA patents for commercial 
use except by licensing TIPEM.  I have been told this outright by Kurt 
Stammberger of RSADSI (their VP of marketing, I believe).  This is not 
secondhand information.  All commercial software that I know of using RSA 
public key encryption and RSA stream ciphers (such as RC2 and RC4) uses TIPEM 
and BSAFE, including Lotus Notes and Apple PowerTalk.  RSA's royalty structure 
is based on a percentage of revenue, with the percentage on a sliding scale 
based on gross corporate revenue (not just on products which use RSA's 
patents).  If you keep your margins low to compete in the marketplace, you 
lose.  Even you folks are making your money on high-margin products (servers) 
rather than low-margin ones (clients), I'd wager at least in part because it's 
a way to make money despite having to pay RSA royalties.

The RSAREF license has been loosened up some recently, but it's still 
restricted to freeware.

I don't have to pay royalties to sell an implementation of TCP/IP.  Your 
analogy fails.

You've already got your eggs in the right basket on this one--sell servers and 
services, not client software.  Microsoft has a miserable track record in the 
server arena (witness the underwhelming success of Windows NT :)).  It's also 
less of a commodity market, which is where Microsoft excels (no pun intended).

Mostly RSADSI people, by my count.  Great technical background, but I wouldn't 
call relying on one of your technology vendors "peer review"...

Precisely.  Rather than working with others in the industry and research 
communities, you are trying to push your proposal into the standards track.

On this I agree completely.
