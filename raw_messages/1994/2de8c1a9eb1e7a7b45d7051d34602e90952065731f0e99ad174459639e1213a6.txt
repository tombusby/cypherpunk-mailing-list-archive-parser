Well, summers gone, fall is here, and I'm sufficiently caught up with all
my projects to go ahead with <insert drum roll here>

A New Cypherpunks t-shirt offer!

The shirt:

Printed in white, on a heavyweight black t-shirt.

Front:

              CYPHERPUNKS
     Putting the NSA out of business
