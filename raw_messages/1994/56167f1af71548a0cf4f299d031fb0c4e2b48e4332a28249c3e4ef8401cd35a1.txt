Greetings c'punks.
    Regarding the discussions at the physical meeting, I'm in the progress
of compiling a list of BBSs in my area.  I plan to walpaper 'em with a letter
about Clipper.  The reason for this is that most average "hacks" have little
or no information about Clipper.  When I chatted with some folks on the BBSs,
many of them didn't know what I was talking about.

    The attack I'm forming uses public awareness.  We need to educate
Joe 6-Pack.  If I tell 100 people, I would hope that 3 of them would become
concerned.  To this end, I'm asking for suggestions for a letter (no more
than 1000 words 'cause people too lazy to read a lot) that explains in
J.6. terms what Clipper is and why it is a thing to be avoided.

    When I get something together, I'll post it for corrections and/or
enhancements.  Then, if everybody on this list posts it on 5 other places,
we might actually get somewhere.

                       I look forward to hearing from y'all,
                                                          G.C.G.
