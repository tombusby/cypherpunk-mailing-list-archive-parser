More or less.  It doesn't need to implement everything straight off: the
API itself just has to pass all the information that's necessary.

Actually, I'm not talking about implementing the library in a multi-platform
way.  Once the API is specified, people could be found who would do the 
implementation for any given platform.  I'd do a UNIX version that would
straight off translate appropriate calls to RSAREF for RSA calls and
implement IDEA.  A friend of mine is interested in doing the PC version .

Encryption is a pretty straightforward process in the abstract:  While
such an API might not be well suited to hyper-fast stream methods, it would
be Good Enough to have something that could be integrated into mail and
news easily.  News and mail are doing the same thing: a big part of the
difficulty in getting integrated support is in the cumbersome interface
to PGP and the percieved short horizon on PGP changes.  If a unified API
promised that a crypto API would stay put, I think more people would be
hacking code.

I'm not talking about implementing it all at once.  In essence,
a PGP engine that used these calls would be useful because people could
implement MUAs and newsreaders (and perhaps web browsers) that easily
integrated PGP encryption by linking with the newest version of the PGP
distribution: and then, as newer methods and formats came along, all
that would be required would be a relink to support new formats (another
function, BTW, would be a guc_parse_format() that would determine the
format of the input).

Only the spec itself need be exported, no crypto code or even hooks.
RSAREF would have to be part of the RSA methods inside the US: outside, it
would probably end up being the old PGP code that the current 2.6ui-style
PGPs use.

Certainly, some APIs are much better than others.  The C stdlib, for
example, is a pretty good API.  Stdio does a very good job of abstracting
concepts to calls that work across filesystems as different as VMS's
RMS and MS-DOS filesystems.  I'm talking about C -- not every platform
supports C++.  The OS isn't important: the API can be implemented
independently.

Frankly, I don't give a damn about it becoming an "idustry standard" if that
means Microsoft, Lotus, etc.  I have no interest in doing their work for
them.  I'm more interested in generating a "net-standard," something that
people hacking code for themselves or for freely-distributable packages
can use.  It's a necessary step along the road to "crypto for the masses."
