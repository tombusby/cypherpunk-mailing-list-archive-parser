Stat text scanning is ancient, but has probably not been used on the scale
and efficiency that the NSA would require for net traffic.

Actually my 'info' about NSA's thing was mainly deduction put together 
with some (limited) specs on Architext (http://www.atext.com
graham@atext.com). If you read NSA's note carefully, you easily rule out
NLP ("independent of...language") and sophisticated neural nets ("very fast").
The Economist story I mentioned in my last post (on the fact that I beat 
them to the story!) goes into some detail on BT and Cornell's programs that
summarize textual matter. These are apparently successful (included is an
pretty good example of a computer-generated summary of the article), but 
also quite different from NSA's.

BT uses basic NLP to get past articles, conjunctions etc (making it
language-dependent), and stems (removes -ing, -ed, -s etc, unlike NSA
which denies stemming, dictionaries etc; obviously language-dependent),
before creating statistical table of word frequencies which are used to
determine the subject of a sentence or the similarities between texts.
Cornell can search "gigabytes of data ... in a few seconds [for] a
subject" or similarity to an example text. It can figure out which
sentences are 'important' (by comparing frequency tables).

I suspect NSA's is much more pattern-oriented, as its USP is document 
clustering; maybe it uses some NN at some level. Of course you don't really
need to know grammar to filter out articles and pronouns; you could do that
statistically too.
