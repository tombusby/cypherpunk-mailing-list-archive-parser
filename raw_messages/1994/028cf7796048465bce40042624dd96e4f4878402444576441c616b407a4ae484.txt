Well, since it's in the first couple of man pages for sendmail, it's not very
obscure :]  I would have expected better material from alt.hackers....

Yes; we had some discussion about this here a few weeks ago.  I, for one, am
doing just that.

As I understand sendmail, it only sticks outgoing messages in the queue if 
you tell it to do so. Otherwise they can be sent pre-emptively or in the
background. This can be specified on the command line:

     dx             Set the delivery mode to x. Delivery modes are `i' for
                    interactive (synchronous) delivery, `b' for background
                    (asynchronous) delivery, and `q' for queue only - that
                    is, actual delivery is done the next time the queue is
                    run.

In any case, this doesn't provide any information about incoming mail.

Besides, with ps -aux you get to see all the invocations of sendmail, and
the invocations of pgp, and so on. I'd worry more about that than about the
sendmail queue. Convincing sysadmins that they should somehow disable the -a
option on ps doesn't sound like an easy task to me.

All this ultimately argues for placing terminal remailers on private machines,
which I think we've agreed is a Good Thing.
