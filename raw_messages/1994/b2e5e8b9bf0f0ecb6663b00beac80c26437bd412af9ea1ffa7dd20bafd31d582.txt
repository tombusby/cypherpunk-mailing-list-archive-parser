Peter Passell writes longish article today on the company CD 
Radio and other ventures to sat-cast digital radio nationwide.

One excerpt:  "with digital technology, satellite broadcasters 
can stuff dozens of channels of CD-quality, 
interference-resistant programming into a narrow ban of 
frequencies."

Has there not been discussion here before about the use of this 
technology in lieu of hard-wire for the Net?
