Cypherpunk-related meeting in LOS ANGELES (West side) CALIFORNIA U-S-A-
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following text was written by SEK3:
- ---   T H E   K A R L   H E S S   C L U B   ---
invites you to attend our third meeting on Monday, August 15, 1994
beginning the first in a series of debates on current libertarian
movement issues:
 
How Does THIS Smash the State?
 
To be fair we start with a division within the Agorist Institute itself...
 
Resolved: TECHNOLOGY will ABOLISH Government.
 
For the Positive: J. Kent Hastings, Assistant Director, AI; author of
"The Information Underground Railroad" in Agorist Quarterly #1
For the Negative: Samuel Edward Konkin III, Executive Director, AI;
Editor, AQ#1; creator, New Libertarian.
 
Will cypherpunks drag David Rockefeller kicking and screaming from the
Trilateral offices to face justice? Will you be able to pay for this
dinner by an e-mail check? Cheer the brilliant young hacker, future of
our movement, or the grizzled old movement founder, or our favorite
candidate--None of the Above! [Next debate: Working from Within]
 
TIMES: 7 pm, dinner. 8 pm Agorist Institute presentation.
8:15 announcements. 8:30 pm DEBATE
PLACE: Hasmik's Family Restaurant, 9824 National Boulevard
In Cheviot Hills Center, National Exit from Santa Monica (10) Freeway.
(310) 204-1591. Order from menu: "No menu item over $9"
Beer and wine available. Photography, si! Only two rule changes: Leave
at 11 rather than midnight and (gasp!) no smoking! Smokers will be invited
to nearby private luxury apartment after 11 pm--non-smokers are always
tolerated.
 
Buses: Note that MTA buses are running; however, the closest route is the
Santa Monica (blue buses) #12 route until 7 p.m. Busers will have a car
shuttle to Venice Blvd. for nearby all-night service.
