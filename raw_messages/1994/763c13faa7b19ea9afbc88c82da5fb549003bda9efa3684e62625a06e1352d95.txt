Really?  So your only defense against ideas you don't like is to make
the dissemination of the ideas illegal?  Clearly there are values you
rate higher than press freedom.  (That's not necessarily bad, though I
personally don't like it.)

Sorry, but if you have to go to some office and ensure them you're
following the "rules of newspapers" or whatever, then that statement
is incorrect.  I can this instant decide to print out thousands of
copies of whatever I want, drive down to some public area, and start
handing out my documents (or charging for them), all without a visit
to a government office.  That's not illegal.  Only "pornographic"
material is inherently illegal to distribute (and that irks me, I
assure you) (though not because I'm interested in that line of work).

(I'll leave it to Mr. Godwin to point out the various little laws I
might break doing something like what I described above; the point
stands nevertheless.)

What does that have to do with press freedoms?

Actually, we don't see much about German elections; there's not enough
airtime between the football games and TV shows.

So can I in the US---today.  The problems spring up when I try to
export what I write.
