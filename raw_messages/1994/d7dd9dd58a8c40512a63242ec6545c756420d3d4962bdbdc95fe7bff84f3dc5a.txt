    system to send encrypted documents to the Document
    Server. . . .

    Given a Document Server, the problem now becomes:  How
    can you prevent the government from proving you use a
    Document Server.  This seems like a strictly technical
    problem, unlike the "can they compel you to reveal your
    key" problem.

/No hay problema/.  The situation can be handled similarly to
that of a "spendthrift trust."  In that case, the trustee has
complete discretion whether or to releases money to the
beneficiary.  Trustees NEVER release funds to the taxman or other
creditors.

If your Document Server is located in a foreign jurisdiction, and
you instruct its operator NOT to release your files--even to
you--if you are incarcerated or otherwise under duress, there's
nothing the government can do.  Just be sure you take all the
necessary steps *prior* to coming under a court's jurisdiction.
