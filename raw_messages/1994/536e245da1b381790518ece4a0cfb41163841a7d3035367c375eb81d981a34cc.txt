This sounds useful, but I'm curious how you would enforce it. I would think 
you'd need to do some nontrivial statistical analysis to be reasonably sure 
you weren't allowing various binaries, uuencoded files, etc. with faked PGP
headers, without preventing people from using other encryption schemes. I'd
say this is the flip side of the challenge faced by governments trying to
outlaw transmissions using strong crypto.

Incidentally, I'd love to get pointers to online pieces of code which
perform various statistical tests on data to find patterns characteristic 
of particular encryption schemes, &c. for cryptanalysis.  I want to 
cryptanalyze a couple of encryption algorithms and would like to do some
experimental work.  Please send me mail directly and I will summarize to
the list later on. My starting points are Applied Crypto, the CEB, and Tim's 
Cyphernomicon.
