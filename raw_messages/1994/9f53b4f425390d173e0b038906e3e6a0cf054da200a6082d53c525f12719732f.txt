I would say that an algorithm is also a rigidly constructed 
framework 
consisting of well-defined formula within a stabilized 
potential well; as 
such it has limited operability in situations which possess 
fuzzy 
heuristics - such situations would include ordinary-language 
parsing, by 
the way, if a theoretical full-accountability is to be given. 
Eliminating 
indeterminacy and `true randomness' is eliminating the 
lifeworld itself, 
with its fuzzy heuristics not always reducible to natural law, 
even of 
the trajectory-bundles of chaos theory. So we are thrown back 
to a 
quantum computer which is reduced in the quoted text as well to 
a 
theoretical 
positioning; this is suspect since such a computer also 
functions in the 
lifeworld. If the brain in Penrose's text functions as _a_ 
quantum com- 
puter, what is the source of the singularity (_a_)? It seems to 
me that 
there is, in the real, deep fuzziness all the way around. Are 
we dealing 
with a group of logicians who have ignored Schutz? I think so, 
_precisely._
