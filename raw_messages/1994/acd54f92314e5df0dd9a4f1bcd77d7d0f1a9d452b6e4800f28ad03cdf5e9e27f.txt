No sooner said... Ahem. The patches to both PGP 2.5 and RSAREF 2.0 are
both obscenely trivial, actually, with the exception of the bug fix (!)
to idea.c, which was obtained mere minutes after my bug report
courtesy of jis@mit.edu himself.

Should elegance be demanded, crypto.c and language.txt should both be
patched to mention the new upper limit. With MAX_RSA_MODULUS_BITS out
of the way, MAX_BIT_PRECISION is the next hard upper limit, defined as
1280 bits. There isn't any glaring reason not to increase that
constant as well... However, my goal for the nonce was to grandfather
old 1024+ keys.  I don't see much point nowadays in generating a new
key that a thousand other "stock" PGP users won't be able to utilize.

In accordance with the terms of the RSAREF 2.0 license agreement, I am
providing a copy of this modification by electronic mail (note CC:);
they may have a perpetual, royalty-free license to the three bytes I
changed :-)
