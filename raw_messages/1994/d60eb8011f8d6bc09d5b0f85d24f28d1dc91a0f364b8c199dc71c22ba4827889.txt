Here's a script that you might want to use as a base:

(echo helo;echo mail from:\<`logname`@`hostname`.`domainname`\>;echo rcpt to:\<$1\>;echo data
echo X-Info-1: This message was sent using fastmail 0.1 - contact ecarp@netcom.com
echo X-Info-2: for more information. Copyright 1994 by Ed Carp.
cat
echo .;echo quit)|telnet `echo $1|cut -f2 -d@` 25
