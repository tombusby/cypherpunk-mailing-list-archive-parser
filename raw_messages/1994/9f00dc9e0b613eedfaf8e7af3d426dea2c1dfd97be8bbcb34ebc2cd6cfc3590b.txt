Easy enough to fix. Will code this. I just sent new PGP Tools and Magic
Money updates to MPJ. He must be getting tired of me sending him new code
all the time. :-) The latest version does protect against garbling of the
message from client to server.

Any way to avoid this, other than a cumbersome cut-and-choose?

How many small primes would it take? How would he know what numbers to
multiply to get the coins? Just create random coins and look for one which
is made of all small factors? I should try this and see if I can find one.
Not being an expert in the math, would most coins have a large factor, or
would there be a fair number with only small factors?

Any math whizzes out there care to run these numbers?

The high-byte check I will code up right now, but I'll wait until we figure 
out what to do about this problem, before dumping any more code on MPJ.
Is anyone going to start up a server, when the program is debugged?

I can think of one way. Redefine the coin format so the last 2 bytes or so
can be anything you want. Now when the user generates a coin, he sets these
last two bytes to 0001 and then tests for primality. He keeps adding 2 and 
checking until he finds a coin which is prime, or at least doesn't have any 
small factors.

When the server gets a coin, it checks it for primality, and only accepts
coins that pass the prime test. This way any coin made out of small factors
will not be accepted.

The small-factor sieve is fast, and with the proper #defines, it checks 
all primes below 8192 decimal. The slowtest() PGP uses is slow even for the
512-bit primes used to make 1024 bit PGP keys. It would be useless for a
full 1024-bit number. Would eliminating coins with factors below 8192 be
enough? Or how could one more quickly check the coin for primality?
