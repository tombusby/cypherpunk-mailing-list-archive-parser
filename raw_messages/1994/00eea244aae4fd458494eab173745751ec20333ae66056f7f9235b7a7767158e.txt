  I suggest changing "to" to the previously mentined
"post-to"/"send-to" convention. This eliminates the need to perform
parsing magic on the virtual address. Also it's a simple issue, but
what's the syntax for defining a variable, e.g., NNTPSERVER or
NEWSGATE?

  Sounds like a nice feature.

  Another good idea, but how would I, as a user, know with which
idstring one of my messages is associated?

  I've followed the arguments for having the remailers keep track of
each other's availability. This is fine as long as one can strongly
trust at least one of the remailers. The chaining functionality also
belongs in the mail client--even more so than in the remailers.  With
extensible mail environments, e.g., mh/mh-e, this should be possible
without too much difficulty.

  I don't know if it's been suggested, but has anyone created a
remailer that scans a newsgroup for posts addressed to it in some
manner, e.g., an X-header or the first non-blank line, and then
handles the post as if it had received it via mail? Sort of a Kibo
mail gateway.
