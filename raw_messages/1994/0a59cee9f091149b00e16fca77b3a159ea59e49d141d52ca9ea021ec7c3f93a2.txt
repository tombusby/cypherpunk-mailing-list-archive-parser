   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology announces that it will
   shortly distribute PGP version 2.5, incorporating the RSAREF 2.0
   cryptographic toolkit under license from RSA Data Security, Inc.,
   dated March 16, 1994. In accordance with the terms and limitations of
   the RSAREF 2.0 license of March 16, 1994, this version of PGP may be
   used for non-commercial purposes only.
   
   PGP 2.5 strictly conforms to the conditions of the RSAREF 2.0 license
   of March 16, 1994. As permitted under its RSAREF license, MIT's
   distribution of PGP 2.5 includes an accompanying distribution of the
   March 16, 1994 release of RSAREF 2.0. Users of PGP 2.5 are directed to
   consult the RSAREF 2.0 license included with the distribution to
   understand their obligations under that license.
   
   This distribution of PGP 2.5, available in source code form, will be
   available only to users within the United States of America. Use of
   PGP 2.5 (and the included RSAREF 2.0) may be subject to export
   control. Questions concerning possible export restrictions on PGP 2.5
   (and RSAREF 2.0) should be directed to the U.S. State Department's
   Office of Defense Trade Controls.
