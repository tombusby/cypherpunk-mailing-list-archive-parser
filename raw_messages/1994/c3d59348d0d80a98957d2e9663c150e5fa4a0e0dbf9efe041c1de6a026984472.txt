nntp.hks.net's hks.lists.cypherpunks has back to June.  We'll continue
to keep at the very least one month back, even once we start archiving
and expiring -- and the archives will be available by ftp.  So people
need only keep pointers to Message-IDs within the archives.  I'll
almost certainly hack something together that will retrieve articles
on the Web in my copious spare time.

For now all the articles are available both via nntp for newsreaders
and ftp via ftp://ftp.hks.net/cypherpunks/nntp/cypherpunks/
(it's big).
