pgp key server functionality just took a great leap forward today when
io.com's email server suddenly went interactive!

finger @wasabi.io.com      for details
        ^^^^^^
        Note the 'wasabi' - finger @io.com won't work.

You can get a list of users by doing:   finger user@wasabi.io.com
or even:                                finger user@host@wasabi.io.com

And once you find their Key ID from the summary listing, you can
then do:
                                        finger 0x123456@wasabi.io.com
                                                 ^^^^^^
                                                  The hex digits from the keyid


Have fun!

The Mgt.

PS The finger requests to this server are *NOT* logged.
(At least by us.  Who knows what the NSA is up to :-) )
