A buck is NOT a buck. It keeps on going down in value. We should use the
introduction of digicash to finally create a monetary instrument that never
experiences positive inflation. Incorporate in a foreign land, invest the
money safely, issue and buy back shares according to a fixed formula that
depends only on the valuation of the company, publish your returns and
register the stock as securities in as many lands as possible. You now
have a perfectly legal basis for digicash. The shares will float in the
range of values specified by the stock issuance formula. They will
gradually go up relative to inflation and will be easily traded in multiple 
currencies. And it will be really difficult for most governments to attack
the "payable to bearer" nature of the currency because it would encroach on
the rights of all American corporations. No?

This will once again make the value of the digicash dependent on when it was
issued. An alternative formulation of this same scheme would have the value
od digi-cash be invariant with the data of issue, but have periodic
redemption dates on which the value of the digi-cash would jump. I find
neither to be desireable.

Market liquidity is increased by convenience to the holder of the securities,
not the issuer of the securities.
