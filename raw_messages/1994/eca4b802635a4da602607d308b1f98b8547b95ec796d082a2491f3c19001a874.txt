Having had some experimental success with mass mailing the media, I've 
already considered the concept.  Pertinent adresses would include major
newspaper, TV and periodicals.  Items would have to be newsworthy, not
just informational.  Personal attention would be paramount.  A live person
would have to monitor the responses, personally appologizing for the 
inconvienience to those requesting deletion, with assurances that the matter
will taken care of to their satisfaction immediately.

Out of the God knows how many media adresses Adam Gaffin provided me, I had
two deletion requests.  One from an IL local, and the other from the Pheonix
Gazzette.  Notable persons requesting to be kept informed of newsworthy 
developments on the electronic frontier include Adam Kaul of NBC News.

IMHO, we need to use our technological resources to their greatest tactical
and operational advantage.  Albeit, ladies and gentlemen, we must consider it
of paramount importance to preserve a strategy of befriending the media, 
avoiding at ALL COST a technological alienation of them.

Serdar's roboposts are the classic example of what not to do.  I'm sure if
this ever gets out of the intellectual stage and into the operational, 
sufficient safeguards for our integrity will have been established.
