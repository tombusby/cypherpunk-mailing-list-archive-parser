Cypherpunks,

well, after poking around some, I found out that the remailers
elee7h5@rosebud and elee6ue@rosebud are down... they have been
renamed!

Yes, that's right!  They are now named elee7h5x@rosebud and
elee6uex@rosebud.  I've been testing and they do seem to work just
like before.  I'll flush out the two latency queued messages since I'm
not sure I can re-enable the chained remailer (I sent through the one
message that bounced).

Now this may be a pain as far as the remailing scripts actually
because both accounts are locked, so I don't have the secret keys
available to me anymore, in order to rename the public keys.  I guess
both those remailers are on the possible edge of extinction anyway (I
figure they were just renamed and locked because the grad student who
admins rosebud probably can't figure out how to remove an account
being a VMS guy ;)
