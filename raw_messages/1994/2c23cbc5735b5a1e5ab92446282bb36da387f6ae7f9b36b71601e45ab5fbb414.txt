    Extremely.  Speaking as someone who derives particular joy from 
culture jamming in all of its forms, it sounds like a great thing to do 
if it is done appropriately.

    It's a good idea; especially since the information is public record 
an is available from the state government on tape for a reasonable fee.  
Unfortunately, from what I've heard from people who actually have the 
database (for Florida), it works out to be several gigabytes of data, 
which is unfortunately too large to fit on a CD-ROM unless severely 
compressed.

    Perhaps - but it is extremely likely that the local government would 
take a rather dim view of it.  The DMV record data is probably restricted 
by some clause or other to non-marketing purposes.  Before trying 
something like that I would suggest speaking to a lawyer or being willing 
to have large legal problems.

    This would definately get you thrown in jail and your CBI account 
killed.  It's a violation of CBI's use agreement and also against the 
fair credit reporting act.

    I think there's a happy medium where you can shake people up without 
going to jail in the process.  :)

    Yes.  It's doable, but once again, I would seriously suggest a 
different approach.
