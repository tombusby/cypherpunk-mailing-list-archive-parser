	As I posted only a few hours ago, I have been working on
improving the Magic Money interface. I've written a server application
for the Magic Money server which allows the server to sit on a port
and wait for connections. When a connection comes in it forks and
processes the request, by just taking the input, passing it to the 's'
server released by Pr0duct Cypher, and then returning the server's
output.

	The client is a front end to Pr0duct Cypher's 'c' program,
which handles the communication between the 'c' client and the server
running on a socket. I have written the client so that it can be run
from any directory, but it looks in ~/.bank for the bank.asc,
rand.dat, and other files that the program uses.

	I just wrote this code today, so I'm sure it lacks many safety
checks. If you'd like to point out where it goes wrong, I'd appreciate
it greatly.
	
To invoke the server:

Edit server.pl and give it the port number you want.

Run 'server.pl' in the directory which has the 's' program and the files that
the 's' program uses. server.pl will fork and wait on the port specified.

To run the client:

Create the ~/.bank directory, and put rand.dat and bank.asc in that
directory.

Edit the client.pl to reflect the port number and the hostname of the
server, as well as the location of Pr0duct Cypher's 'c' binary.

client.pl -initialize

	Generates your account.

client.pl -incoming [filename]

	Takes in incoming coins (which someone has given you) either from
filename or stdin (if the filename argument is missing) and adds their
value to your wallet. (Doing the communication with the server that is
necessary)

client.pl -extract [filename]

	Extract coins that you own into filename, or if filename
doesn't exist pgp ascii-armor the coins and send them to stdout.

client.pl -exchange

	Exchange your old coins for new ones.
