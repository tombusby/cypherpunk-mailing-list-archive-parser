Hi folks,

Looks like I have been removed from the list with out any notice.
I could tell because I stopped receiving your mail.

Guess I just wasn't punk enough. :)  Or prehaps this list doesn't
care for artist who are interested in encryption...

Anyways, if you would like to reach me, you can send mail directly
to me at lile@netcom.com. 

I will not be posting to cypherpunks after this message.

be seeing you,

-lile

ps. My art is in a virtual art gallery called OTIS.
