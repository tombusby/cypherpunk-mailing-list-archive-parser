You can deposit money electronically without leaving a trail, too.

I'm not going to say how -- consider it a "trade secret", but others
will doubtless come up with similar ideas to mine.

You don't need to be near the bank for that either. Use an ATM machine.

Why not just sign an electronic bank draft? Why not use Chaumian
digicash? Seems far too complicated.

I would suggest that you probably ought to read up more on the subject
-- you have obvious enthusiasm for it, but others have already thought
of many of these issues in detail. Reading Chaum's paper and learning
a bit about commercial law (especially w.r.t. commercial paper) and
the "open literature" on anonymous electronic banking would be
valuable.

Of course, its illegal for them to do this in the U.S. -- banks can't
give out numbered or otherwise anonymous accounts. It could be done
overseas, of course...
