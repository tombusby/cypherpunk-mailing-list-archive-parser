The statement someone earlier made (I don't remember by who) that "The 
black budget is taxation without representation.", could be restated to 
indicate that it is taxation without *true* representation, for all the 
reasons that many subscribers to this list would already be aware of 
(if there was true representation, there would be some rather 
anarchistic congressmen & IRS agents in office).

Which reminds me -   "In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream".
(In the space between some people's ears, that is.)
In the best circumstances, open & honest speaking would be more 
profitably addressed to an audience possessed of an active intelligence 
that is interested in knowing & comprehending the actual & its consequences.

I didn't see, in Tim's reply to my question about the spreading of 
"disinformation", where what he relates represents that (perhaps 
because I'm not very knowedgable regarding some of the 'facts' 
mentioned);  it actually seems to me to be an unfortunate label to 
apply to all of these efforts, since they are offered in a concern for, 
and in consideration of, the consequences to everyone's personal 
interest - privacy.  Whether the picture is "blown up" to appear to be 
worse than it looks, presently, seems moot, since it should be easy to 
imagine what could happen in the future even if these invasive plans 
are not yet in effect; i.e., just what such a scenario purports for the 
situation here in the US and everywhere else.  The future truth could 
be more fearsome than any present, alarming fictionalization.  (But, 
then, I'm prepared to imagine.)
