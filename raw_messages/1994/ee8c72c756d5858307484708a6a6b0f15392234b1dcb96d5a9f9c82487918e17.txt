Earlier I said I would forward to the list a posting I did on digital
time-stamping, describing the Haber and Stornetta system.

But I'll instead repost Stu Haber's comments, for more detail.

>>  The canonical reference for digital timestamping is the work of Stu
>>  Haber and Scott Stornetta, of Bellcore. Papers presented at various
>>  Crypto conferences.
>
>See below for pointers to the papers.
>
>>  Their work involves having the user compute a hash of the document he
>>  wishes to be stamped and sending the hash to them, where they merge
>>  this hash with other hashes (and all previous hashes, via a tree
>>  system) and then they *publish* the resultant hash in a very public
>>  and hard-to-alter forum, such as in an ad in the Sunday New York
>>  Times.
>>
>>  In their parlance, such an ad is a "widely witnessed event," and
>>  attempts to alter all or even many copies of the newspaper would be
>>  very difficult. (In a sense, this WWE is similar to the "beacon" term
>>  Eric Hughes used recently in connection with timed-release crypto.)
>>
>>  Haber and Stornetta plan some sort of commercial operation to do this,
>>  and, last I heard, Stornetta was moving to the Bay Area (where else?)
>>  to get it started.
>
>We do indeed plan to do just that.  Bellcore has spun off a company,
>Surety Technologies, whose charter is to bring digital time-stamping
>into widespread use.  Resisting the charms of the Bay Area, we decided
>to stay in New Jersey.
>
>Instead of closing off our trees once a week and publishing their roots
>in the national edition of the Sunday New York Times, as we've been
>doing for over two years now (including this week: look for the Public
>and Commercial Notices towards the end of the main news section of
>today's paper -- on p. 30 if you get the NY-area edition), we are
>planning to close our trees at sub-minute intervals and make their roots
>widely available.  By the end of the summer, we plan to have a service
>bureau (to build the trees) up and running, and client software
>available to access the service -- both for time-stamping documents and
>for validating (document, time-stamp certificate) pairs.
>
>>  This service has not yet been tested in court, so far as I know.
>
>Nor as far as I know.  But we do plan to push this issue, on several
>legal and regulatory fronts, so as to enhance the legal acceptance of
>appropriately authenticated digital documents.
