Perhaps. But anger over taxation can be a powerful galvanizing force
that gets disinterested, apolitical, apathetic people to stand up
and vote. It may not be your philosophical piece of cake, but it works.

Besides, getting angry at the result of a policy is a good first step
to questioning the policy itself. "If you don't like high taxes, think
of where all that money is going."

It's hardly gratuitous. The general public feeling nowadays, that
their money is being taken whether they consent or not. Given that
(nonconsensual takings backed by prevailing law), it is perfectly
rational to "get yours", i.e. milk the resulting machine for whatever
you can do (including, i might note, disregarding prevailing IRS codes).
It's not a "government favor", it's called "getting back your money."

Not necessarily. It is quite enough to convince many of your neighbors
that they (a) are not getting their tax money's worth back from the
government(s), and that (b) there's a better way. Right now, it seems
that (a) is gathering steam. The problem is expressing (b) - which
many of us are convinced of - in terms Mr./Ms. Average Voter can
agree with... and "taking money from government is uncivilized" does
not strike me as very effective.

To a blind optimist, an optimistic realist must seem like an Accursed Cynic.
