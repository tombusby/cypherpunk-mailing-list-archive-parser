After reading many of your posts on the MIME issue, I have come to the
conclusion that you _are_ wedded to a past long gone. I have not give up
the hope that we will one day convice you stop accessing the net via the
worst possible interface, a terminal server. The way you are using the net
is through 1950's technology with 1950's results.

You say that you use stuff that is far beyond ASCII and I believe you.
However, one wouldn't know from hearing what tools you are using to access
the net. You are competent, a computer person, but still you don't seem to
understand that reading mail via a terminal server and elm is like having
an oxen pull your car.

You got Eudora. Setting up tia ($25) on your account and downloading
Newswatcher, etc. takes less than an hour. In fact, I will gladly do it for
you. After the clients are set up on your own machine, there is no reason
to go back to using the shell. I have used the shell *two* times in the
last three months. -- To change my password.

You wouldn't have to change your workhabits. You could still read news,
answer email, and surf the web all at the same time. In fact, you could do
it better and easier than you do it now.

I have AppleScript droplets on my desktop for all the people I work with.
Drag the spreadsheet icon on it. Hit "Queue". They double click on it on
their desktop. Happens every day.

This list is email and, yes, it is in ASCII. There is little reason to
change that. But that doesn't mean that most of the net is in ASCII. I
spend less than half the time that I am on the net in a pure ASCII
environment. And it is getting less every month.

I hate to break it to you, but it is no longer "most of us" who don't use
these tools. And of the ones that don't use them, only very, very, few
don't have them available.

I don't think that you are wishing for a "simpler world". I believe that
you haven't realized that the "simpler world" has long vanished in the dust
of history and that you are one of the last hold outs living in an era
past. Please don't be the last to leave.
