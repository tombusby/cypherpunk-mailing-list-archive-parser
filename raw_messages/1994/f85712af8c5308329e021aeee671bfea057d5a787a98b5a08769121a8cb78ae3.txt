By publishing a private e-mail, both beker and Johnson are in violation of
my copyright in that message, since it was a private communication and no
permission was given to republish.

Thus beker has now committed a new violation of his netcom agreement, and
Johnson shows he has bad judgement. What's more, by trying to make what
should be a private matter, to be decided by netcom based on their own
rules, into a public cause celebre, and by writing to netcom as Johnson did
to intervene in a private matter, he has made the situation worse for beker,
not better.

Netcom is perfectly capable of telling me to go peddle my papers if I'm
wrong.

Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!!!  I wish this man would overdose  
on whatever medication he must be taking.   Or...perhaps he already has!


P.S. Sternlight breaks down into a rather amusing number of combinations if you  
take it as "stern" and "light."  For example:

stern  ->  rump
light  ->  intense

DOLLAR HAS SPIRITUAL VALUE!
JERUSALEM - Israel's chief rabbi, Mordechai Eliahu, says people should keep  
U.S. dollars in their pockets when in a restroom or an unclean place. His  
office said Wednesday that an American Jew raised the question because the  
bills say: "In God We Trust." The rabbi's religious ruling said that because of  
the motto, dollars must be treated the same way as holy documents and not be  
exposed to filth.
