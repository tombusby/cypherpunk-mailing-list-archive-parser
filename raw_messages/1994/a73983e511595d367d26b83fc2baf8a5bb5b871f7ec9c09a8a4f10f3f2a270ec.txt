These are related. Law enforcement is already referring to unbreakable
crypto as "fortress crypto" and is trying to scare the public into
banning strong crypto by invoking the Four Horsemen of the
Infocalypse: terrorism, pedophilia, money laundering, and drug
dealing.

The comments of Donn Parker along these lines are especially chilling.

Indeed, this is what has excited me for so long about strong crypto. I
certainly knew about the public-key work, and I met Diffie and Hellman
many years ago. But it was not until late 1987-early 1988 that I put
it all together and realized what all this stuff meant for personal
liberty and the eventual undermining of states. "Crypto anarchy" was
born in the spring of 1988. (As I've said before, I approached David
Chaum at the 1988 Crypto Conference in Santa Barbara and told him
about my ideas on remailer networks, on how a "Labyrinth" of anonymous
remailers could ensure electronic mail transmission that was not
traceable and not regulatable, that cyberspatial economies could then
evolve, independent of states. Chaum looked at me, nodded with
bemusement, and pointed out that his 1981 paper had anticipated and
examined these points! I was both pleased and chagrinned. Pleased that
I had duplicated Chaum's "mix" idea, though not in the same
cryptographic detail Chaum used, and chagrinned that it was not my
invention.

I'd forgotten this point...it's been 22 years since I read "Shield."
Have to find a copy and read it again.

Yes, crypto technology makes for the equivalent of Anderson's
"shields," of Vernor Vinge's "bobbles." (in "Peace War" and "Marooned
in Realtime") More energy needed to penetrate these crypto bobbles
than exists in the universe.

[This is the point where believers in reversible computation usually
step in and explain that reversible nanocomputers--or the legendary
"quantum computers"--can overcome this energy limit. I remaine
skeptical, but if they've read this far and wish to comment, go right
ahead.]

The important point is that crypto technology offers a *technological
means* to ensure personal liberty and a lessening of collectivist
power, much as the *technology* of printing nuked the power of
medieval guilds and ushered in the modern information age.
