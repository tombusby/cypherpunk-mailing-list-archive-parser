But it's just putting us and the government on a _level playing field_,
isn't it?  That's all we're asking for!

...  Yeah, right.  Like tariffs backed by armed thugs.

Don't know about democracies, but in a free country what the government 
needs is a good reminder of who's in charge of whom, since the citizens
would be expected to know that already.  And even in a democracy,
if N-1 of the citizens decide that they want to know your key,
they can decide to hire the rubber-hose guys after the fact
if you don't cooperate.

		have in the purely voluntary income tax system
		which gives the Democractically elected government
		the money they Democratically decide to spend.
		Or something like that.
