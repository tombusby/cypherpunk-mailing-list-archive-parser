Blacknet wasn't real; it was a posting Tim May anonymously posted advertising
network support for various illegal services, including where to
send your digicash blackmail or ransom payments and the like.
Basically to try to get us to think about the implications of the
technologies we're developing and potential for abuse and paranoia.

On the other hand, maybe it wasn't *really* Tim May anonymously posting it,
and the Tentacles of Detweiler will be posting GIFs of you and your
friends talking to notorious politicians to alt.your.mother
and releasing that new virus with your name on the banner page unless
you help Eric start a digibank to deposit some ransom money in. :-)
