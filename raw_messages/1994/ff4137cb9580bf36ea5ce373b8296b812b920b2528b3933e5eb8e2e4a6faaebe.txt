Subject: Re: Senator Leahy's hearing

We've had quite a bit of interest and e-mail regarding the Clipper chip
hearings and we passed it all on to our programming department for
consideration at today's shoot meeting.

Unfortunately, we will not be covering this hearing.

Thanks for your interest in C-SPAN and please feel free to write again when
an event of interest comes up.
