The whole problem w/ QM is that it is not, by its very nature, linear. Every
logical thought pattern you have needs to basicly be thrown away when you deal
with this real of physics. Consider an electron emitter that throws them out
180 degrees out. Because of the conservation of spin rules the electrons must
have opposite spins. However, when they are emitted you can't tell what their
individual spins are. However, when you measure one the other INSTANTLY orients
to the other value (ie +/- 1). This change happens faster than light (there
is no way a electron can emit a photon before you measure it unless it can
somehow jump into the future and know a priori when you measure it. Very nasty
problem w/ no explanation at this point. You can propose Tachyons and other
exotic particles but detecting them because of their lower limit velocity (ie
they must always travel faster than light) keeps us from measuring them. 

The point I am making is that the logical rules you use don't apply down here.
