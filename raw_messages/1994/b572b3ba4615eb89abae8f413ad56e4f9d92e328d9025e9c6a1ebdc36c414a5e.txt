The NYT ran an op-ed piece by David Gelerntner arguing that
the Digital Telephony and Clipper initiatives are a good idea.
He is a professor of Computer Science at Yale University who
is known for developing a parallel processing langauge known
as Linda. He recently received a letter bomb that really hurt
him and he mentions this in the piece. The FBI has been tracking
this bomber for some time, but they haven't been able to catch
him/her. 

It's in the edition of Sunday May 8th.
