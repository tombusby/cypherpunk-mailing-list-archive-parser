Are these guidelines, which are undoubtedly written down *somewhere*,
exempt from disclosure under FOIA?   If not, then this might be good
way to go; if the claim of exemption appears weak, it may be worth
litigating.  Getting actual disclosure of the guidelines may be worth
quite a bit, since not only does it inform us-the-public about the
rules, it can make it easier to sue the government for not abiding by
its own rules (if it violates them).
