There's something called CFS written by mab@research.att.com which is 
an encrypting file system for many flavours of Unix (essentially does 
NFS over the loopback) including Linux. It isn't the fastest
thing in the world, but it does work.

I've heard mutterings about a port of SFS to Linux, but I don't
have any concrete information about this. 

You can get the latest SecureDrive from ftp.wimsey.bc.ca
/pub/crypto/software/dist/US_or_Canada_only_XXXXXXXX/SECDRV/secdrv13e.zip

to find the value of XXXXXXXX
cd /pub/crypto/software
and read the README file.
