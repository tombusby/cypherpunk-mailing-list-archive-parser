I'm not sure I get your point.  If I imagine the soldier in the field 
deficating he won't have any power over me?  Or do I have to imagine the 
gun deficating?  The profanity doesn't seem to help me follow your ideas.

One of the problems with cypherpunks, and Mr. May mentioned this
some posts ago, is that you have close to 700 views.

If our friend at nobody wants to "out" someone (if that's what he's 
doing), he has his own purpose and motives, and Mr. Davis has little
constructive to say about it.

With 700 people on the list, it's likely that someone will have some 
useful purpose for this information.  Since it's impossible to tell who, 
or even if anyone can do anything with it you might as well just let it pass.


-russ says:

If the cypherpunk movement is to be an effective non-violent force, it
must realize that secrecy is no help.  The best designed action will
work even if your enemy helps you plan it and carry it out.  Karn's CJR
is an example of this.
<-

I couldn't disagree more.

While secrecy may be difficult, it is HARDLY of no help.

In many ways the discussions on cypherpunks frame the issues months
in advance of the media, the executive and the policy arms.

People come to cypherpunks with new ideas, code and structures.

People in cypherpunks forward budding advances in centralism and 
technology both pro and anti - privacy and crypto.

In short, cypherpunks is ahead of the game in many respects. 
Would be a prime source of more than SigInt, but also of HumInt.

Its nice when the enemy can't do anything about your work, but it's also 
rare.  The more likely is that the enemy is doing IT'S WORK secretly.  Or at 
least quietly and with politically timed releases.

The best directed action will work even if your enemy helps you plan it 
and carry it out without even knowing they did.
