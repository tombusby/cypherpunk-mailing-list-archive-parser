Certainly the use of an anonymous remailer in and of itself it doesn't make
one either a coward or a hypocrite.  However, invading someone's privacy by
posting their telephone number and home address is a hypocritical act for
anyone who expects others to respect their own privacy.  Moreover, doing so
anonymously is cowardly.

And, yes, my using my long-standing nickname, "Lefty", is _quite_ different
from posting anonymously.  You can reply directly to me using my email
address, <lefty@apple.com>, which appears in the header of everything I
post; moreover, I am responsible for what I post using that ID.

See it up there?  You can easily determine who I am from that information.

<lefty@apple.com> is, in effect, a True Name.  <nowhere@bsu-cs.toad.com> is
not.  <nobody@jarthur.cs.hmc.edu> is not.

It is not the case that anybody "pointed out a privacy lapse" here.  On the
contrary, someone _committed_ a privacy lapse by obtaining and posting Mr.
Nalbandian's phone number and address _specifically_ as an incitement for
people to harass him.  This _is_ an invasion of privacy.  Are you somehow
failing to see that?

What you have supplied represents an invasion of privacy as well, in my
opinion.  If you were to explain how you came by this information, _that_
might be worth sharing, but simply presenting a mapping of anonyms to
truenyms is not.
