I really hate to pick stuff like this out, but people in washington STATE 
are sensitive to this stuff, and talking like this might create some 
confusion, so..

The Washington meeting in _Seattle_ went well -- we had 11 attendees for 
our first meeting ever. Hopefully, with better planning :) we'll have 
even more at our next meeting. 

Since it was our first meeting, much of it was spent introducing 
ourselves and planning logistics of our monthly meetings. 

We've decided to pursue MBONE connections in anticipation of the next 
broadcast Bay Area meeting. We're setting up a local group mailing list 
to service our local needs.  

In the event we can't get MBONE, our meetings will be held one week after 
the Bay Area meetings, in hopes that some kind soul will be able to 
provide us with rough minutes or the like. I know that this has been done 
before, although I know it is a thankless job...
