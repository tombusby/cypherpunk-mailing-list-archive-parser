My comments are in the brackets -< >-.

	Before I start commenting, however, I would like to take this 
opportunity to once again say I DON'T AGREE WITH THESE SEARCHES!!!!! Many of 
you have taken that to be my tone, and that's not right. I was just expressing 
the opinion that I think that since all the other choices they have are 
blocked, and the residents don't seem to mind, then it's the right solution FOR 
NOW. I'm not trying to say that this should become policy, I'm just saying it's 
the only way that things could be done (at least from what I know of the 
situation).
	I don't profess to be an expert on this whole mess, I was just 
expressing my opinions. They are mine. Not yours. If you don't like them, 
either acknowledge that you don't agree with mine politely and civilly or just 
shut up. I have _NO_ time or tolerance for people who think that they are right 
just because they have such-and-such opinion about something. If you can't take 
the time to see both sides of the story, don't take the time to comment on just 
one side. Opinions are to be shared. If you don't like mine, then just don't 
read it. This is not aimed at anyone in particular, I'm just saying something 
that I feel (my god, another opinion!).

  [excellent points all]

-<Indeed these are excellent points. However, many people get their information 
from the mass media. I also go to school in new haven, so I have the same 
sources for information that you do. I am more than willing to admit that most 
of my info is from what I se and read in the papers and on the news. But at 
least I make the effort to stay informed.
Also, you say that you "live in this kind of neighborhood at home." That's at 
home. You are here in New Haven. And it's only like CHA. You don't live there 
so don't expect me to think that you are right just because you live in an area 
that is similar. Unless you have actually _lived_ in Cabrini Green, I will take 
your thoughts with a grain of salt.>-

  [Bravo!  Would that more people took personal responsibility!]

-<I didn't say that you didn't. And I too applaud the neighborhood 
responsibility. There is always safety in numbers, be they people or a cypher. 
But I wasn't saying how important these guns are except that the gangs have a 
hell of a lot more than the cops do.>-

implyed it. I was only talking about the gangs. Never mentioned where they get 
their members, never mentioned where they get their guns, or drugs, or 
whatever. I was only saying how the people in the CHA buildings were fed up 
with the bs that was going on and decided to do something about it.>-

  [And, even in the finest 'burbs, the police cannot be everywhere!
   Indeed, if you study police doctrine, it very clearly states that
   police and DETER crime, they can APPREHEND criminals, but they
   cannot PREVENT crime.  Even a 5 minute response time will not solve
   the problem.  Indeed, a 1 minute response would not...because
   someone must call them first!  Still more significantly, the criminals
   are not stupid.  They go where the money is...and if it is easier to
   steal Rolex's and 'Benzs in Suburbia...guess where they'll go?  The
   city manager (!) here in San Antonio found this out when he was
   robbed in the driveway of his house.  <no, he doesn't live in the
   inner city.  >]

-<I never said the cops could be everywhere at once. I only said that the cops 
were outgunned and outmanned. You were the one who started on about that.

And don't assume that I'm from the burbs. To tell the truth, I am. But what if 
you had been wrong? I knew that I had life different than others the whole time 
I was growing up. I like to beleive that I give others a chance to prove 
themselves no matter who they are because I know that my life and education has 
been different. Just because I grew up in a 'burb doesn't mean that I'm an 
elitest jerk-off. Remember what they say about assuming things....>-

   [I'm as xenophobic as the next guy ;-), but I don't think the problem
   is necessarily suburbia;  rather, it often seems that people in general,
   and irregardless of socioeconomic status, are eagerly discarding
   rights in order to escape personal involvement.  Merely voting is
   (seemingly) too tedious; and anything more demanding is (again, seemingly)
   completely out of the question.  Who was it who said "He who would
   trade a little liberty for a little security deserves neither"?]


-<Allright, I don't want to say it again, but I have to. I am not for these 
searches, I only said that they seem like the right thing for the CHA police to 
do considering their circumstances. Last time I checked, this country was a 
democracy. The guy who started the searches had to get permission from the 
people living in the apartment to start the searches. If most of the people in 
the building thought it was a good idea, then the majority can't be wrong, 
right? 
I know the Bill of Rights also, and I'm not saying they should abandon it. But 
until they can come up with something to deal with these gangs, I think that 
the searches are appropriate.
