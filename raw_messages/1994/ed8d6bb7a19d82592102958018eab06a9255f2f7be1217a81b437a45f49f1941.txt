Sadly, the state of PC platform SCSI is in turmoil, at least right now.
Microsoft is working hard to convince folks that Enhanced-IDE is the
answer, and many CD-ROMs, big disks, etc. that are aimed at the mass
market are no longer SCSI, but E-IDE.

I don't think you can substantiate your claim that a "great majority of
DOS machines" have SCSI.

Worse, MS is pushing hard to push into Windows-for-Workgroups. Many OEMs
no longer ship Windows, even for standalone PCs. They ship W4Wg.
W4Wg's support for SCSI devices is a step or two down from even
W4Wg 3.10. My SCSI disk setup (1.7GB Maxtor) is significantly slower under
W4Wg 3.11 because MS changed things to the point that I no longer have
32-bit disk I/O.

Chicago is claimed to have "better" SCSI support, but I was hoping that
I could get this at least prototyped this summer. No RSN reliance
on 3rd party vendors for me, thanks.

Right now, SCSI is too high-end (Suns, HP, Macs, serious PCs, etc.)
for the market that I have in mind.
