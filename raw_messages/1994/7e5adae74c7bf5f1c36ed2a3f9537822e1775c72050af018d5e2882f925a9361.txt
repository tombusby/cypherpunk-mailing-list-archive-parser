MORE ABOUT `SQUISH' AND `FACE'
===

  The Federation of Associations of Cyberspace, Everywhere was founded
  in 1994 as a group that coordinates the activities among the many
  different online organizations. We have played a very low-profile
  role to date, and wanted to find some way of promoting our newfound
  alliance. We have groups combined from BBSes, local area networks,
  the Internet, and other global and local networks around the world
  (see below).

  We have built up some membership funds from the contributing
  organizations and private contributions to provide the prize money
  for SQUISH, and some private individuals have donated significant
  amounts. The contest was inspired by S.Boxx, who was the architect
  of point classifications and the current opponent lists. S.Boxx has
  also promised to provide any funds necessary for the successful
  completion of the contest. We hope that recent interest into snakes
  and tentacles by many on the Internet will make the contest
  spirited entertainment and a strong success.

  We encourage reporters and the media to use this announcement as our
  official press release. Feel free to redistribute or comment on
  this announcement in any forum.
