Correct. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

From what I've been able to glean from the below reference, at
the very beginning of the study, in 1932, the subjects were given
rather innefective treatment.  From about 1933 on the focus of
the study became purely one of longterm _untreated_ syphilis. 
Indeed, during United States Public Health Service campaigns
against V.D. in the South, during the late '30s and into the '40s
when more effective therapies were coming into use, subjects of
the study were actively *denied* treatment; to the point of
actually pulling them out line at clinics (those who sought
treatment), telling them that they weren't supposed to be
treated, and sending them home.

This "study" was conducted under the auspices of the United
States Public Health Service, was not a secret, and ran for
40 years.
