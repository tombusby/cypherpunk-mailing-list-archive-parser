    Bombs are used by building demolition teams, excavation workers and
(believe it or not) there are even a few artists who use explosives to
create their particular brand of art.  I won't even mention 4th of July
fireworks and the creators thereof.

    Granted, not many people fall into these catagories, but does that
mean that the rest of us are entirely un-interested in how they work.
A student of physics might be interested in the physics of a falling
building...  Okay, I reaching, but the possibility exists!
