Intersting word, "spewed".  It's a synonym for "vomited".  If you'd get 
your head out of your ass and out of the 17th century, you'd realize that 
the slang expression "to Ralph" also refers to vomiting.  And that's 
exactly what you've done all over the Internet, RALPH!

Like any fire, it would require STOKing, would it not?  Gee, you were sort 
of appropriately named, weren't you?  When somebody asks what your job is
in Hell, it can be said Ralph stokes.

Those who have endured your incessant blathering over in Fido land tell me 
that you've said a few quotable things, such as "G-d is a Devil", "El 
Shaddai is Satan", and "all the words in the King James Bible are God's 
pure words, including 'pisseth', 'ass', 'bastard', and 'dung'".  Therefore, 
I've tried to avoid "profanity" in my response and use only the words that 
you consider "pure".  Thus' let me say, "Pisseth upon thy ass, thou bastard 
who eateth dung".

May your wife (if you can even attract/keep one) "Bobbitize" you.  Can I 
recommend a good doctor?  Kevorkian!

Go thou and fornicate thyself.  Thou shalt not "Spam" the Internet/Usenet!  
Go back and play in the Fidonet sandbox until you learn how to play nicely 
with the big kids...
