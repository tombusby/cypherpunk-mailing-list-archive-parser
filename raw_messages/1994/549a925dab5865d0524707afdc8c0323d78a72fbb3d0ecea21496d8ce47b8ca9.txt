I'm beginning to think that he's right.  Not that he isn't responsible for
anything he ships through the remailers, but that the remailers should be
redesigned, because it's becoming clear that boneheads such as Detweiler rob
such remailers of any potential usefulness through their abuse.

For this reason, I'm going to start rejecting any mail coming from an anonymous
remailer.  I've just gotten to the point where any potential usefulness is
totally outweighed by their inconvenience and the inability to filter the
ani-for-brains who persist in abusing them.  Unless someone can come up with a
way to make them useful again, I just can't see any reason to read 'em.
