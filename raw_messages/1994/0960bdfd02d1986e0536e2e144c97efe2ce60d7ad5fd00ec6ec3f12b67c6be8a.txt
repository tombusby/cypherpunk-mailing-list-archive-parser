PGP 2.5 really sucks...

Why?
 - You can't use your old secret key. So you have to build a new one.
   Why? I don't know. But PGP 2.5 don't recognize your pass phrase anymore.
   Maybe that new RSA algoritme is easier to crack. So they force everybody
   to create a new key...

 - A new RSA algorithm??? What's wrong with the old one???

 - Why not bigger keys than 1024 bits???

 - Why can't PGP 2.3a read PGP 2.6 messages anymore after 1 september 1994?

The only good thing about 2.5 is that it's legal in de USA and Canada? But
why doesn't someone gets a license for PGP 2.3a so that's a legal version
too! (or is that inpossible???)

... If you outlaw Privacy, only the Outlaws will have Privacy!
