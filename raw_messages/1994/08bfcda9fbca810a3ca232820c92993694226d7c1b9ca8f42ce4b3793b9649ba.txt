I have now picked five of your remailers for distribution of the PGP FAQ
in four parts and my "Here's How to MacPGP!" guide. The top five in this
list are the ones that worked out.

      1: Remailer accepts only plain text headers.
      2: Remailer accepts both plain text and encrypted headers.
    
      1  hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu <-[Very fast.]
      1  hh@cicada.berkeley.edu <-[Very fast.]
      1  hh@soda.berkeley.edu <-[Very fast.]
      2  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu <-[Very fast.]
      2  hfinney@shell.portal.com <-[Fast. Ugly header.]
      1  00x@uclink.berkeley.edu [Fwd: hh@soda.berkeley.edu] <-[Very fast.]
      2  hal@alumni.caltech.edu [Fwd: hfinney@shell.portal.com] <-[Fast.]
      1  nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu <-[Way too slow.]
      1  remail@tamsun.tamu.edu <-[Way too slow.]
      2  ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu <-[Way too slow.]

What does the "Fwd:" mean (from the PGP FAQ)?

Now, would someone send me a script that I can run that will assign csh
environmental variables (I use setenv) B1 through B10 with a random
combination of those five remailer addresses? I will then hop each
message off two remailers.

Do you have any objections to this? Suggestions? I pissed Julf off without
realizing the "size" of the problem beforehand. Are there any remailers
I've neglected, which are FAST?

If this works out, I may inadvertantly become your best "customer" ;-).

P.S. I sent about 8 rapid-fire (3-5 seconds delay) packages JUST through
hh@soda.berkeley.edu and they came through without a glitch. This was about
a full meg of traffic. Can these remailers take this? Anon.penet.fi limits
messages to 48K. Do these remailers have practical limits? What about the
normal size restriction on e-mail; what is this understood to be, if I need
to mail to most anyone including AOL, Compuserve, BBSs and overseas?

P.S.S. That's "N A THIRTY-EIGHT ONE-THIRTY-EIGHT" with Subject "Bomb me!".
Do NOT tell people "an", or just hit the 'r' key. Then I'll HAVE to route
the guides through anon.penet.fi since I wont know your real address. A
bit of this is OK, but not a lot.
