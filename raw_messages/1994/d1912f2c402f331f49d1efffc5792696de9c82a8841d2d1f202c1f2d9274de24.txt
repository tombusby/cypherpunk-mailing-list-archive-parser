Dear Colleagues;

An overview of TEMPEST can be found in DCA Circular 300-95-1, available 
from your nearest Federal Documents Depository / Government Library. The 
section of interest in is Volume 2, DCS Site and Building Information, 
sections SB4 & SB5, (Grounding,Shielding,HEMP). SB5 though not directly 
covering RFI/RF Emanation is devoted to shielding for high altitude 
electromagnetic pulse radiation (HEMP). The documents discuss Earth 
Electrode Systems, Fault Protection Systems, Lightning Protection Systems,
Signal Reference Systems, and RFI containment, they also briefly 
discusses radio signal containment (TEMPEST) as well. This is a must-read 
for anyone wishing to keep their bits to themselves. Discussions of
testing and validation methods are not discussed in the unclassified 
documents. I have included the references to the Secret/Classified
documents for the sake of completeness. It is possible that some of
them are by now de-classified, or may be requested through FOIA.


Several other U.S. Federal documents are of interest:

Haul/Tactical Communication Systems", U.S. Dept. of Defense, June 14, 
1978.
