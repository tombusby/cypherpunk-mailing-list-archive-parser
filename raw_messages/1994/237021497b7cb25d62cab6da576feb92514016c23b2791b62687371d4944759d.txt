A number of people have asked me what SKIP is.  

IBM's patent covered modular key management in a manner that isn't
clear to me.

SKIP is Simple Key management for Internet Protocols: it's an elegant
key management system that uses Diffie-Hellman public keys (Aziz notes
that any DH-like scheme will work).  The IPsec folks wanted (or just
were considering it?) to use it in their secure IP work, but were balking
at the patent status.

Here's how to get the draft (I don't understand it well enough yet to
do it justice in a summary) :

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories. This draft is a work item of the Internet Protocol Security 
Protocol Working Group of the IETF.                                        

       Title     : Simple Key-Management For Internet Protocols (SKIP)     
       Author(s) : A. Aziz
       Filename  : draft-ietf-ipsec-aziz-skip-00.txt
       Pages     : 17
       Date      : 10/26/1994

There are occasions where it is advantageous to put authenticity and 
privacy features at the network layer. The vast majority of the privacy and
authentication protocols in the literature deal with session oriented 
key-management schemes. However, many of the commonly used network layer 
protocols (e.g IP and IPv6) are session-less datagram oriented protocols. 
We describe a key-management scheme that is particularly well suited for 
use in conjunction with a session-less datagram protocol like IP or IPv6.  
We also describe a simple extension of this protocol to provide scalable 
group key-management for Internet multicasting protocols. SKIP is designed 
to be plugged into the IP Security Protocol (IPSP) or IPv6. This draft 
describes how to use SKIP in the context of the IPSP.

Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ipsec-aziz-skip-00.txt".
							
NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.
							
For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@cnri.reston.va.us.
							

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
