Sometime minutes of meetings get posted, usually not. It's a lot of
work to do this, both in the writing and in taking good notes during a
meeting.

I've written up minutes for two meetings, I recall, and Arthur
Chandler did for a recent meeting. Not much reaction to either, except
nit-picking of details by others, so there's not much incentive for
any of us to bother.

Being an anarchy, we have no officially assigned minutes takers.

Another issue raised by some (to me, at least) is that formal minutes
could be used against us by some agency or entity, or at least that
some folks would be sufficiently worried about being quoted that they
would feel less free to speak up on controversial issues.
