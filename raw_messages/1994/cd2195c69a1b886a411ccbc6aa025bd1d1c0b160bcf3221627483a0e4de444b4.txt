A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.                                                               

       Title     : IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)               
       Author(s) : R. Atkinson
       Filename  : draft-atkinson-ipng-esp-00.txt
       Pages     : 12

This memo describes the IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). ESP 
seeks to provide integrity and confidentiality to IPv6 datagrams. It may 
also provide authentication, depending on which algorithm and algorithm 
mode are used.  Non-repudiation and protection from traffic analysis are 
not provided by ESP.  The IPv6 Authentication Header (AH) might provide 
non-repudiation if used with certain authentication algorithms.  The IPv6 
Authentication Header may be used in conjunction with ESP to provide 
authentication.  Users desiring integrity and authentication without 
confidentiality should use the IPv6 Authentication Header (AH) instead of 
ESP.  This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the related 
document "IPv6 Security Architecture", which defines the overall security 
architecture for IPv6 and provides important background for this 
specification.

Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-atkinson-ipng-esp-00.txt".
							
NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.
							
For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@cnri.reston.va.us.
							

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
