Hello, all!

Apologies for the waste of bandwidth, but it's been over a week since
I have received any mail from the cypherpunks list. Is anybody out there?
Please respond by private e-mail so as to (a) keep the racket on the list
down and (b) sidestep a 'cypherpunks' mail trap at my location (if one 
exists). Noise and all, I find this list interesting - I'd hate to lose it.
