The major motivation.  Crypto gives you the power to carve out a "zone of 
privacy" at will and say to the whole world, "This part of my life is mine 
alone."

Though they *were* largely invented there...

Distinguish "desire for privacy from Govt." and "'cyber-survivalist' 
inclinations" -- seems like the identical motive.  It *is* government that 
digital volunteerists (a friendlier term) seek privacy from.

I think Tim uses the term "collapse of governments."  Most of us are just 
making predictions about the sort of institutional changes that will occur 
as people discover that they have more choices.  Since controlling people 
by threatening to kill them if they disobey (the Political Means) only 
works if you can carry out your threat, if people can erect "unbreakable" 
barriers against States, their power is reduced.  One doesn't have to 
overthrow them.  They are overthrown by a change in their tactical 
capabilities.

And here I thought "lefties" were opposed to coercive monopolies.

We're everywhere!
