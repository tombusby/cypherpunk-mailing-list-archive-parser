People don't deal with MIME. Computers do. The average user shouldn't be
any more concerned with MIME info than with IP header length. That your
inadequate and buggy mailreader exposes you to the inner workings of MIME
shouldn't be held against the standard.

The two (email and web) are not alternatives, as you have stated in your
previous post. Email has gone to MIME. HTTP couldn't exist without MIME.
What on earth is your problem with MIME? Your posts read like they come
from someone who complains about 8 bit data on the net because everytime
they display it on their terminal it makes strange noises and generally
screws things up.

PLEASE stop using your VTwhatever emulator and you will find that MIME
becomes a non-issue. Out of sight, out of mind. All you will notice is that
all of a sudden you get more out of the net while finding it simpler to
use.

PLEASE! For your benefit and ours.
