Well, my personal secretary compiled every single media email adress in the
_Big_Dummies_Guide_ into 6 alias'.  Then I emailed it to every one of them.
If the FBI comes to the front door, this piece of shit XT clone I use for a
UNIX terminal goes out the back door and off the sun deck into the alley.

I suppose the fucking phone will ring off the hook in Ft. Meade for a while.

By God!  It's a good day for the Revolution!!!

*** Here's the follow up ***

To whom it may concern,

You have been emailed an authentic National Security Agency Employee's
Manual.  I as an Electronic Frontier Foundation member, acting purely
on my own initiative, and solely accountable for my actions, have emailed
this information, as well as John Gilmore's FOIA attack on the current
Clipper Chip proposal for key escrowed encryption, to every media source
with an email adress listed in EFF's _Big_Dummies_Guide_to_the_Internet_
on the entire planet.

You may authenicate the NSA manual via confirmation by the phone numbers
listed in it.  Consider this the shot heard round the world in the
Electronic Revolution.

			Sincerely,

			Jeff Leroy Davis, AKA Eagle

			EFF Member # 2176
