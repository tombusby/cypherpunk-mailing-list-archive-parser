RemailerNet v0.2 (RN0.2 for short)

1.0 a number N of RN gateways exist
1.1 these communicate using encrypted packets of a fixed length L
1.2 messages may originate from gateways or from outside the network
1.3 messages are passed across the network in packets
1.4 a packet may contain data from 0, 1, or more messages
1.5 routing of the packets is randomized (this does not mean that
    the probability of a route being chosen is equal for all routes,
    it means that if N>2, there is no route for which the probability
    is 1)
1.6 the order of dispatch of packets is randomized
1.7 on average, all gateways are required to send and receive the same
    number of packets per unit of chronological time
1.8 the dispatch randomization function adjusts the average latency
    and the distribution of latencies so that the preceding commitment
    is met, introducing noise packets as required
1.9 mechanisms allow the traffic level to rise quickly but constrain
    them to fall slowly
1.10 gateways are required to exchange the same number of packets in
     any session
1.11 inter-gateway connections may be either open at all times (in
     which case sessions begin only when the connection has gone
     down by accident) or they may be established periodically

2.0 any message has a source gateway and a destination gateway
2.1 message fragmentation takes place at the source gateway
2.2 message reassembly takes place at the destination gateway
2.3 all packets are acknowledged
2.4 message delivery is reliable, in the sense that the destination
    gateway will report delivery of incomplete or damaged messages
    to the gateway
2.5 messages may be sent to a gateway for forwarding to another
    gateway
2.6 message delivery time can be specified
2.7 message delivery policy can be specified
2.8 delivery policies include (a) hold until picked up, (b) hold
    for a specified period of time, (c) discard if not received
    immediately
2.9 gateways should always destroy mail after delivery is
    acknowledged [unless the mail is to an as-yet-unspecified
    persistent store]

3.0 gateways frequently exchange routing information
3.1 that routing information has an expiration date
3.2 gateway operators can choose who they announce routing information
    to and accept routing information from
3.3 gateways can settle accounts with one another periodically

4.0 level 2 gateways will communicate with one another using RN
    protocols using IP datagrams
4.1 level 1 and 2 gateways will communicate using the same protocols using
    email (SMTP) datagrams
4.2 where gateways are operated by users, the requirement that gateways
    should exchange the same number of packets per unit time would be
    weakened in some as yet unspecified way

5.0 end users may either operate gateways or communicate with a level 1
    or 2 gateway using email
5.1 in either case, users may have accounts with gateways and may be
    charged for usage

6.0 RN gateway software should be available only from trusted sites by FTP
6.1 RN bootstrap software should be available on diskette
6.2 the bootstrap software should allow the secure downloading of
    system updates over RemailerNet

7.0 an alt.? group could be used to announce new gateways
7.1 established gateways would be encouraged to rate new gateways
7.2 software updates would be announced in the alt.? group
7.3 a FAQ would be published in the alt.? group every ten days or so

8.0 users would be encouraged to use gateways in geographically
    distant locations
