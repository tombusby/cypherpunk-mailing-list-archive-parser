Ironic what you say, Graham.  Given the fact that the subject 
matter is PORNOGRAPHY, often involving explicit depiction of 
sexual intercourse, which is somewhat of a "religion to some", 
maybe that's exactly what Nathan was asking -- for pornographers 
to keep their "fucking religion" off the net...

Just as adults can avoid reading what the consider "offensive" 
material, so can you, too, avoid lashing out in a blind fury at 
posts like this that YOU disagree with.  If one didn't know 
better, it'd seem that YOU are almost advocating censorship of 
ideas that you deem offensive. <g>
