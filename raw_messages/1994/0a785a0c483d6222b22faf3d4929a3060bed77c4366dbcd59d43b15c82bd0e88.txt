C'punks,

Okay, somebody needs to fess up.  I *know* someone on the
Cypherpunks Channel is writing about the Clipper Chip and other
crypto-privacy issues for /Expat World/.  I thought I was the
only one who had even heard of this newsletter for expatriates
until I saw some of the crypto articles.

Whoever it is, is doing a great job.  In the June 15 issue, in
the article, "How Big Brother Wants to LIsten, Too," the writer
coined the term "Al Gorewellian."  Gotta love it.

If the writer of these articles is reading this note, please let
us know who you are.  You deserve the recognition.  (If you want
to keep a low profile, how 'bout sending me private e-mail?  I'd
like to discuss some things with you.)
