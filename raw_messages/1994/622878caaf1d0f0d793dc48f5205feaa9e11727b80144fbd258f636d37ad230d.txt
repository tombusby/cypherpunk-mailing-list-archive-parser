The more I think about this, Eric, the more I think I caved in too early.
Can you explain exactly how charging a back-end load on a digital cash
certificate prevents double-spending?

This reminds me of the previous discussion of holding a person's cash bond
hostage for good behavior.  In this case, you're holding unencumbered
redemption rights hostage and reducing transaction costs in relation to the
person's relative risk. I think I get it now. I sort of took it on faith
before, but I'm not so sure all this is necessary, see below.

I think that the business model I've been proposing may handle this a bit.
In order for someone to cash out, they need to be able to speak to an ATM
machine, which implies a bank-acceptable identity (whatever that means).
It allows for nyms to trade offline, and it banks on being able to catch
the nym by police work (Ace Ventura, Nym Detective!) if a
"self-credentialed" nym double spends. Since most fraud schemes require a
nym to do it, web-of-trust stuff would have to apply in the case of
transactions with nyms. It's ugly, but it should work.

I'm pretty sure I'm a little more loosey goosey about this. I think that
there may be enough of an enforcement mechanism even if nyms remain
completely anonymous.
