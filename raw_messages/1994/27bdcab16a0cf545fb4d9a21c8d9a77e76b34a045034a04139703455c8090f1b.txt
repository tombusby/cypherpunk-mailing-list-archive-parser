This brings up a point that I - among others - have to flog every now and
then: the *x-centric nature of most of the net. I have no doubt that premail
works wonders - but I don't know of any version of it that would run on my
MS-DOS box
a Mac
an Amiga
etc. I use PC Eudora for email
and have pinged on QualComm every so often to ask when the commercial
version will allow/support external encryption programs. As some may have
noticed over the weekend
I also started trying to use the PGP Tools package to try and write a
PGP.DLL. For various reasons (mostly me :-)
it's going to be more difficult and take longer than I thought - but I am
*not* going to give up on it. Until/unless there exists fairly
easy-to-implement means of including crypto for applications programmers on
a variety of platforms other than *x boxes
progress in the click-a-button-to-encrypt area is going to be bloody slow.

This kinda supports my previous observations: the necessity of adding
external scripts and such to the Mac version of Eudora slows down the
program's operation more than necessary. If there were a Mac resource (of
whatever kind - I'm not Mac-fluent) that the nice folks over at QualComm
could use to build crypto into the program to start with
then they wouldn't have the excuse of "we can't because there's nothing to
do it with at the source level".

My ha-penny's worth....
