Given that this "freeman status" seems to exist only in your fevered
imagination, who's to say what might or might not be a prerequisite for it?
 I'm finding this whole thread extremely silly.

Are you actually attempting to suggest that if someone not currently a US
citizen were to use PGP 2.5 he would somehow become a "subject" (whatever
_that_ is) of the United States?  This would undoubtedly come as exciting
news to Haitian boat people and Chinese nationals jammed into the cargo
holds of trawlers in San Francisco Bay.

What, I wonder, do I have to do to qualify for "moonman status"?
