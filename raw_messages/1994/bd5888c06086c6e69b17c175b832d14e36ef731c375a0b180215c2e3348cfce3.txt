This is also the motivating idea behind "zero-knowledge interactive
proof systems." Systems in which interception of the sent information
is useless to the attacker.

As Norm mentions, the "lock" (which can be many things besides garage
door openers, e.g., proximity-based door locks, or auto locks
themselves, or gun locks, etc.) needs to "do something" that
essentially creates a problem that only the key can solve. A simple
example is public key-private key: the lock demands that a message be
decrypted, or signed, or whatever, by the key.

A good project for Cypherpunks as a group to work on, which I took to
be Sandy's meaning? Well, we don't have any real group projects, and
this is unlikely to be one.

A good project for some particular Cypherpunk? Maybe. I understand the
electronic lock folks (card locks, hotels, etc.) have crypto expertise
of varying extents (and bluntly, probably more than most of us have)
and they certainly have the expertise in other areas.

Maybe an existing chip could be added to "Genie"-type openers.

But let's not forget that such a project, if it succeeded, would
result in legislation requiring Garage Door Opener Escrow.
