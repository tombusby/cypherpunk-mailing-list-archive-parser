Hey guys last week we got ahold of a new board made by IBM that is an
actual ISDN board.  It is accessible as com1, is hayes compatible, and
has the texas instruments DSP chip on it.  The claim is 64kb.  We will
test it and see how it goes.  This would be better than the 28.8 stuff
but I think that still needs to be done for cellular.

I'd like a 250 Mhz 128 bit hybrid processor with 64 meg of 8 way interleaved
memory, a 10 megabyte per second i/o channel, two 3 gig hard disks, two dat
drives with compression, and a large diet coke.
