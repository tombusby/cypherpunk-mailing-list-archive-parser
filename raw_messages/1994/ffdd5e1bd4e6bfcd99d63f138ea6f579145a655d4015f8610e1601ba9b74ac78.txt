  That is to intentionaly trip NSA programs what look for particular words
and weed out the amount of work actual agents have to sort through for 
Internet intelegence work.
  The intent is to make them less effective. there was some suggestion in
some security group to compile a list of potential words the NSA would 
look for and have everyone take 7-8 and put them in your sig file and 
have EVERY one of your posts have to be sorted through exponetialy 
increasing the ammount of work NSA agents have to do manually.

and are nothing to do with the anon-poster; like at the end it says:
please don't throw knives.
