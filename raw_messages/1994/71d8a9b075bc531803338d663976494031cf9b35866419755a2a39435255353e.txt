C'punks,

I would like to start a new thread.  I want to know what the
people on this list intend to do with cryptography in the "real
world."  There are a number of Cypherpunk projects on the drawing
board or already deployed:  Stego, encrypted phones, encrypted
and anonymous remailers, stealth PGP, a digital bank, etc.  Do
the folks on this list intend to use these tools, or is your
interest only theoretical?

I'm not looking for simple "yes" or "no" comments, however.  I'm
interested in finding out how much you are willing to reorganize
your life in order to take advantage of these techniques.  I want
to know what factors would increase or decrease your use of
cryptographic products and services.  What do you want? What do
you fear?

My interest is more than academic.  I am one of the Cypherpunks
involved in creating a digital bank.  If the 700 or so people on
this list wouldn't open an account in a digital bank, chances are
no one else would either.  The same goes, of course, for secure
phones, encrypted e-mail, and all the rest.

What Real World concerns you have about crypto?

Talk to me.
