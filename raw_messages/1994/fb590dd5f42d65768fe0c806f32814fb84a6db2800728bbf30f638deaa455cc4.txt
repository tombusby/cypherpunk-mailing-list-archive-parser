Heh, I forgot the mention my new ID at penet, which was created by
somebody trying to figure out mine:

>You have sent a message using the anonymous contact service.
>You have been allocated the code name an97875.
>You can be reached anonymously using the address
>an97875@anon.penet.fi.

Since whoever forged the post creating this id knows that an97875
corresponds to klbarrus@owlnet.rice.edu, I have no desire to actually
use this account for posting messages.
