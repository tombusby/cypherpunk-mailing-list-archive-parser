the remailers pmantis.berkeley.edu and cicada.berkeley.edu are going to be
phased out.  too much garbage has gone through them, and it has caused too
many complaints, and these are bio research machines, so that's not what
they're for anyway.  i will leave the software running on them for a while
longer, but please stop using them.  00x@uclink has been shut down.  the
sysadmin on uclink set it up so that no user may have executable files in his
account.  this meant that it didn't work, so for a while i was just
forwarding it to soda, which then remailed, but i just shut it down because
the account is going away soon anyway.  soda.berkeley.edu is still up and
running strong, and it will be for the indefinite future.  also, a new
alias-based, pgp-encrypted remailer is coming on line soon.  in fact, parts
of the code are already in testing.  the code will be quite portable and
relatively easy to install.  when it is completed, hopefully other people
will set up alias remailers from their accounts.
