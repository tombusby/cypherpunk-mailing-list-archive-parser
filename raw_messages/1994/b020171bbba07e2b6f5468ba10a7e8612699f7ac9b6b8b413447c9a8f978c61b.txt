Hello there,

    After some work with the SHS (or is the implementation actually
the SHA?) code listed in _Applied Cryptography_, I have patched it to
allow updates of buffer sizes that are not a multiple of
SHS_BLOCKSIZE. The patched version works for the different groupings
of the test data "abc", e.g.,
        update(abc)
        update(a) + update(bc)
	update(ab) + update(c)

    Since the "abc" case tests only the logic of shsUpdate() [all the
transformation invocations are actually performed by shsFinal()], I
ran the original code and the modified code on several files and
(fortunately) received the same hash values for the two
implementations.

    shsUpdate() follows. You may need to define a bcopy->memcpy macro.
