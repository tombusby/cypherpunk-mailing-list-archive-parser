So far I have replied individually to complaints about
the noise coming from L. Detweiler.  My response has
been, and continues to be, that he has the right to post
in public any opinion he may construct.  Some of you
have begun to conclude that these postings constitute
real threats and libel.  I have been reluctant to get
involved, but these claims of illegal activity force
me to respond.

Most of the complaints refer to a document recently posted
to many public mailing lists via remailer services.  This
document apparently describes a fictitious contest or game
called SQUISH.  Individuals named in this document have written
to me claiming that L. Detweiler <ld231782@lance.colostate.edu>
is the author and is responsible for posting it.  They also
claim it is libelous and threatening.

These folks are understandably offended at the references
to themselves and to the invasive method of distribution.
But the connection to Mr.  Detweiler and to the systems I
administer is indirect and assumed.  I have spoken with Mr.
Detwiler and he claims he did not post it.  I have seen no
evidence that he posted it.  His name was not attached to
the document in any copy I've seen.  It was distributed by
remailers that remove the source of the message.  If you're
going to claim libel, you better be able to prove the source.
I've seen no proof; I have seen only finger-pointing.

As to the substance of the document, it appears to be a joke.
The reference to entry deadline of April 1 should tell you
to check your sense of humor before taking it verbatim.

As for the other references cited, including Usenet
postings from anonymous addresses and mailing list
articles delivered by anonymous remailers, I find it
difficult to accept these at face value.  It's possible
that Mr. Detweiler composed these.  It's equally possible
that someone else did so.  There are plenty of copycats
on the net and they're not easy to separate or identify.
I won't even try to sort out the anonymously posted or
remailed data.

And here's what you've all been waiting for:

Regarding Mr. Detweiler's other activities on the usenet
and other public lists, he concedes that his crusade of the
past 2+ months has been less than productive.  He has agreed
to cease the postings that have yielded so few results other
than inflammatory debate.  I expect the noise to quiet.  I
expect to receive from users at large no further complaints
of disruptive data coming from his account here.

Finally, I will announce to everyone who wants to file
additional complaints that I do not enjoy playing the part
of net.policeman, nor net.complaint-dept; that really is not
my job.  Unless you can show some direct evidence that one
of my users is harassing you or otherwise violating your
rights, or breaking some law, I don't want to hear about it.
Complaints about anonymous posts and remailed data should go
to persons administering those services.
