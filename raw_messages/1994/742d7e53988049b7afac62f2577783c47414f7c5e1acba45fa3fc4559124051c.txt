 Jo> So censorship is allowable if the post is objectionable?

I didn't say that, nor mean it.  All I said was that there isn't a
_problem_ unless it's in the content, just as with any other message in
a newsgroup.  The fact that a remailer is used in itself doesn't create
a problem in its posting of an otherwise benign message.  See?

 Jo> Wouldn't
 Jo> that mean the moderator has to make more subjective judgements?

I don't know, but if he was killing messages, he'd at least have to have
a reason.  Someone's address isn't one.  The moderator in question here
(rec.guns) subjectively censors my messages because of content, if
that's your point.

Well, I for one already am.  Rejection of otherwise benign technical
posts for no other reason than having been gated through a remailer,
even non-anonymously with Reply-To: fields and sigs, is about as
subjective and arbitrary a rejection criterion as I can personally
imagine, especially in view of all the absolutely junk posts that do
pass muster.

Most of it, yes, at the moment.

Particularly his irrational fear of remailered posts.  Pure politics.
