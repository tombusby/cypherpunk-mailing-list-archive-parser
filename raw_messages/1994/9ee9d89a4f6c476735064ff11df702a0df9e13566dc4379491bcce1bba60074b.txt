<  My wife suggested that my activities would have gotten me

<40 years ago.  I suggest that the NSA would like to do exactly 
that to
<individuals like Bidzos and PRZ, but it is too late (and the 
net would make 
<it virtually impossible anyway).  Besides, some things are 
worth fighting for.


Dave rightly suggests that black-listing and other such 
stigmatizing and
threatening offenses inhibit the rights of citizens.  These 
attacks also
intimidate others who learn of the aggression on organizations 
and persons
and who fear they may become targets themselves.

To oppose these offenses it seems also right that any attack we 
learn about
should be posted in this forum, at the least.

Please post who else NSA -- and its like -- has threatened 
besides Bidzos
and PRZ.
