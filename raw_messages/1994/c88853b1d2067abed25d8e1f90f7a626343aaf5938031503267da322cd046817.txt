Huh?  Beta testing occurs after significant functionality in the _software_
is present.  The current digi-cash software, as I understand it, would work
find in a real-cash situation.  You would just need to pay for your ecash.
Yeah, a system would need to be set up to deal with fraud and such, that
might not be there right now. But that system is at an entirely different
level then the digicash software, neither vendors nor buyers would have to
deal with it.  The fact that real money isn't being moved isn't a
significant functional deficit in the digicash software, it's got nothing
to do with the digicash software.

It would be stupid to beta the software with real money, because then if it
something doesn't work right, people will lose real money. You want to make
sure that the software works pretty much flawlessly, so people don't lose
real money once the system is being used for real money. And to do that,
you release the beta software without real money.  That makes perfect sense
to me. Later, I'm sure, there will be a beta test using real money, once
the software is completely finished.
