We are able to use ACH ourselves.

Yes, a customer can pre-authorize us to take amounts out of their checking 
account using ACH. The amounts do not have to be periodic, they can be any 
time, any amount.

Our bank, with whom we are setting up ACH, determines whether or not we are 
using adequate security and authorization procedures, and holds us 
responsible if we're not.
