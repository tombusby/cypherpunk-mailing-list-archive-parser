I'd like to think that MY political beliefs have changed significantly since
"college age."  Although it is possibly true that it takes a major change in
your life to change your politics.  My views shifted sharply right with
the birth of my first kid.  They shifted (up? sideways?) towards
Libertarianism several years ago when government interference caused me to
become unemployed.  That trend continues the longer I spend on the net.
It really *IS* the only answer :-)
