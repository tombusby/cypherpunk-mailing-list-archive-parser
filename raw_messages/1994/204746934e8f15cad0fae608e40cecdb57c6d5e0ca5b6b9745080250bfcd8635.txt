The Act does exempt carriers from providing backdoors in the encrytion
it *doesn't* provide; it makes no mention of any exemption or obligation for
*manufacturers.* Here's an excerpt:

Manufacturers are obliged to make available equipment to the common 
carriers "compliant with ... this Act." Even if manufacturers are not (like 
AT&T) also common carriers. The Act does not elaborate on the manufacturers 
role in producing "compliant" equipment, nor on their responsiblities towards
the "provisions of this Act." An interpretation could be that ALL EQUIPMENT
must facilitate the decryption of plaintext under court order. After all, the
Act does require common carriers to provide backdoors in any ecnryption they
provide.
