Blanc is right.

You are correct, Jim, in that in terms of destruction, the wars you
mention surpass in magnitude the other events that I listed (though
I'll point out that if we count Indochinese dead, Vietnam's cost was
far higher than 55,000, even if we add in the more than 60,000 who
committed suicide in the aftermath).  What I am really saying is that
we are not, even in "normal" times, the slightly rambunctious but
contented citizenry that popular mythology makes us out to be.  This
country has serious problems, and it always has.  I think that we may
be in agreement on this.

Another good point that you've made elsewhere is the importance of
economics as a motivator.  I believe that you are exactly right.

I'd like to add more, and also to say something about the perceptive
comments from John Young, but I think I have a flu, so I'll go home
and pick this up again on Monday.

Meanwhile, wishing you all a good weekend. . . .
