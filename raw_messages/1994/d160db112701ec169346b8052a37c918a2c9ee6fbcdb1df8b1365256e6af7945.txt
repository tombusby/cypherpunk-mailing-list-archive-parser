I'm sorry you are so upset. :-(

IPSP was not in my vocabulary at the time of the first posting. Ignorance
was briefly bliss :^)

However, regardless of whether or not extant hardware is reusable,
there is still the not so small matter of software. Software for PC's,
MAC's and a host of UNIX machines before a workable secure network can
be constructed. It is a good thing that IPSP requires only software to
meet it's goals. This same property is true of SSL.

Finally, I never said that "SSL is better than anything out there". I
don't know who did. All I said is that "SSL is something", which isn't
really saying much. SSL is A solution to A set of problems, namely
privacy and authentication.
