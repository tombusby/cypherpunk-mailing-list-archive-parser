No I was not.

As for this current "idea", with an implementation of an encrypted
STANDARD telnet already written and likely available soon for
anonymous FTP, I think I'm being sane, not "a wet blanket". You can
already get a version of the Cray telnet that implements the
authentication code and hack in a reimplementation of the encryption
code if you wish. See below for that. However, producing silly
non-standard telnet hacks makes little sense.

You can't help trusting code installed by someone else. How many of us
write our own operating systems from scratch? So long as you have the
source code, and the source code to the telnet I am speaking of is
widely available, what is the difference?

The source code for the authenticating telnet is available from

	ftp.cray.com(128.162.15.3):src/telnet/telnet.94.02.07.NE.tar.Z

Now, David Borman has not been very forthcoming with the encrypting
version of this system (although all the hooks are already there) and
if anyone wants to take a crack at adding in an implementation of the
draft encryption standard (which should be quite quick) that would
indeed be a useful effort. I will happily mail a copy of the draft RFC
to anyone who doesn't have it and can't get it.
