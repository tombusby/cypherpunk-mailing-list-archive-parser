jsteg's stores it's data based on the compression algorithm and is tied
tothe format (jpeg, which is a lossy compression format).

Stego (which I contributed to and consulted on) actually has a relatively
format independant way of storing the data in the picture. Stego was
written by Romana Machado (romana@apple.com) Check out the article in the
latest WIRED (p. 26?) and the soon to be released (any day now) bOING
bOING.

Quoted from the stego readme:

>Stego rasterizes the image, then stegs data into the least
>significant bit (or LSB) of each of the RGB color values. (In the
>case of indexed color, Stego stegs data into the LSB of the index
>values.) The file length of the data file to be stegged is hidden
>in the LSB's of the first 32 steggable bytes. To disguise this
>value somewhat, I take the second to least significant bits of the
>second 32 steggable bytes and XOR these with the 32 bit file
>length, and then steg the XOR'd file length into the LSB's of the
>first 32 steggable bytes.

Source isn't really necc., but if you feel you MUST have it: contact
