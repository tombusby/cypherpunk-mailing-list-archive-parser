Well... Still no answer about which remailers to use, so I'm inadvertantly
testing them myself. I'm not sure if I had anything to do with it but
hh@cicada.berkeley.edu stopped responding last night but is back this
morning. I finally got back the mail at least (a good thing). Here is the
error. So I'd rate hh@cicada.berkeley.edu to be a MacPlus after all? Tread
lightly on this remailer?
