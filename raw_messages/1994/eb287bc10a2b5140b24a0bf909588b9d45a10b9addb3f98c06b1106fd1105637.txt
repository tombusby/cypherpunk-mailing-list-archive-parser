I'm reposting this in response to a few recent posts inquiring about the 
NSA flyer.

The following was posted on the list in the middle of May.  Being 
curious I called the number list at Ft. Meade. The person on who answered
was real shaken, for lack of a better term, that I called, it seems that 
this was the second inquiry that day.  He wanted to know various things, like
where did I get the information, was my name Bruce....  After a few minutes
he finally took my name and said, to call him in a week to 10 days if I 
did not here from him.  A few day later he called and said I needed to 
send a letter to expressing my interest in the technology.  About 10 ten days
after that I called to inquire if he received my letter and what was the 
next step.  It seems that there had been quite a few requests and that they were
trying to determine whether or not they were going to allow the 
technology to be transferred to individuals. The person said to call back  
in 4 or 5 days.  I called today and they said in essence that they 
were not going to let individuals have a shot at it.  They said that they 
were going to charge stiff license fees, that you would need to show a 
plan of how you were going to develop the product.....  You get the 
point.

It is obvious that they really don't want to transfer the technology.  And if
they do it will be to someone with deep pockets and who they like.

I wonder where the fees that they want to charge will go, to the 
general treasury or to their own budget? 

More later.
