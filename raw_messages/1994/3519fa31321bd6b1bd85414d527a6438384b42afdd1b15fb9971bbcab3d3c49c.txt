Well, I was able to use Word for Windows just now and drop a bunch of them
on a page at once (they're postscript; import them as an .eps), resize
them at will, and print the page out. If you wanted to make your own 
laser-stickers or whatnot, I could see this working for you.

Of course, a nicer program (one more suited for the task) would be 
preferred, but .. :)
