Again, no TSRs are necessary.  Having a simple, common utility on hand is 
all that is needed.

Sure!  Norton's Disk Editor!  I think that it may be limited to doing
everything manually, one sector at a time, though.  I'm not a big MSDOS user,
so I can't direct you to a more convenient utility, but I'm sure they're 
out there.

You don't keep anything off limits.  If an intruder uses the standard OS 
(instead of the proper utility) to write to your disk, he might erase 
your data.  That is not a problem!  He's doing you a favor by destroying 
the evidence.

You, on the other hand, know better.  Thus, you will always use the 
utility to write to the free sectors of the disk.  You will have no 
problem, assuming you keep track of where your data is.

You use a floppy disk that is only accessed by your utility, which 
bypasses DOS (and Windows, which is DOS based).  You keep your disk 
write-protected at all other times.

That's correct.  But this is only the case when you are letting DOS write 
to disk for you.  If you use _direct_ (ie. _not_ DOS) disk writes, you can
specify which sectors you write to!

I disagree.  I do admit that the more security you want, the more complicated
the issue gets.  At the simplest level, all you have to do is delete your
"noise" file.  This is a solution to hiding "noise" files that is 
available to everyone.  Problems crop up only when your opponent is 
determined, knowledgable, and capable.  Although more effort will be 
required, I believe that the system I've outlined will prevent even the 
most determined opponent from finding evidence even of the existence of your
"noise" files.

All the protection that is neccessary is that of your keeping track of
the location of your files.  Just don't write back to those sectors 
again, unless you want to overwrite your data.

Once again, NO TSR IS NECESSARY!  In fact, it is detrimental, for the reasons
that I have outlined in my previous messages.

Only if you use standard DOS disk writes.  Bypass DOS and your problem is 
solved.

Are you forgetting the floppy+direct-disk-writes solution?  Choice 2 makes
sense!

Moving all the data to the end of the disk was not a suggestion made by me.
I agree that it would be rather silly.

Two choices:
 
 Space sacrificed for security.  

 Or, security sacrificed for space.

I understand.  However, your objection doesn't make sense in light of the 
above conclusions.


Thanks for your prompt replies, though!  Keep 'em coming!
