I was thinking that the postmaster would be annoyed by the volume, not 
shocked by the content, of Detweiler's posts.

I understood Detweiler's recent posting about remailer weaknesses as a 
threat to exploit those weaknesses - potentially creating hassle and 
expense for the people whose accounts are used as remailers, and perhaps 
even the other people with accounts on the machines which run the 
remailers. He's no longer talking about (assuming he ever was) using the 
remailers to make an unwelcome or politically unpopular comments - he's 
now talking about using the remailer system to hurt the people who run 
it and the people they share machines with. I take issue not with the 
content of his messages, but their purpose and volume.

I don't know how many messages it takes to swamp a remailer. I predict 
that it's more than 10 times the number of messages, redirected to 
Detweiler's postmaster, than it'd take to get his mail access yanked.

His postmaster can take one of two positions:

1.      Detweiler's conduct is unacceptable and beyond even the most 
basic requirements of decent net citizenship; and the postmaster will be 
in an excellent position to address this concern locally.

2.      Detweiler's conduct is within the boundaries of acceptable 
behavior; in which case, objections to it showing up in his mailbox 
and on his machine (as well as everyone else's) seem hardly appropriate.

If you've ever seen _Brazil_, picture the two maintenance guys with
their pressure-suits filling up with sewage, after Robert DeNiro (?)
replaced their air-supply tubing with sewage tubing. I figure that
piping some of lance.colostate.edu's sewage back onsite seems only
fair.
