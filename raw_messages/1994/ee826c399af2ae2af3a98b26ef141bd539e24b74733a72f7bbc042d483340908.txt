I agree on all counts.

Where those opinions are cast as fact, and done maliciously I have to 
disagree with you.

Where they are legitimate extentions of argument and discussion, I do.

The context was blurred with each successive forwarding.
I might add that as the forwarding went on, it ventured farther into the 
"business associate" types, and much farther from the "friend" catagory.

It's hard to outline without blowing the entire cake, which I'd prefer 
not to do.  Suffice it to say that the distribution was never intended to 
get as far as it did.

The forgeries, while offensive, were not the main point of contention.  
The defamation was.

I think this comes down to a basic question of line drawing.  We could 
argue all year on this point and get nowhere, so I will merely state my 
position and leave it there.

Where a person communicates a knowingly false or negligent accusation or 
characterization about another to a third party, and material damages 
insue, the communicator is liable in my view.

As I have pointed out before, totally anonymous systems make this 
childish and trival threshold of convience entirely moot.  I hope to live 
to see this day.

And this is supposed to convince moral majority christians?

Again, we just differ here.  I understand and respect your opinion, and 
hope as a practical matter that totally anonymous systems will make this 
a realpolitik reality.

Not in so far as you characterized your accusation as an opinion.

This is why there is so much "to do" in libel law about newspapers 
printing "alleged murderer" and so forth.  In theory it's silly.  We all 
know the public reads "murderer" as if the word alleged was never there 
to begin with.  This is a question of damages.  How much damage could 
said accused actually quantify because of this statement?  Who knows, 
probably not much.  In addition if there was no intent on the part of the 
press, there is no case.  Free speech is fairly well guarded in this 
situation.

Non-Media antics are another matter, and can be much more damaging.

Again, it is not my responsibilty to guard myself against defamation.  I 
did to some extent, but to say that because I did not choose an entirely 
anonymous method that anyone might defame me is to my thinking, silly.

On the other hand, those who are enough in the public image are usually 
given the burden.  (Public figure exception)  This would also apply to 
your Clinton example.

Book reviews also fall into a public figure catagory.  As do most of the 
tabloids.  I agree, there is a problem.  

What redress is there however for the defamed?

Can Joe Blow really call my clients and produce forged evidence that I am 
a fugitive white collar criminal, destroy my business and hide behind 
free speech blankets?

Again, it's a question of line drawing.

I guess it's my turn to sound angry.  When was the last time you answered 
tmp publically?  I don't mean this to be a barb... but I just don't think 
that direct confrontation is always the answer.  As it was, my case was 
quickly resolved between the parties.  How much more free speech can you 
get?  He's welcome to violate the settlement agreement, and I can push a 
claim again.  How likely this is to win in the courts is an issue for 
legal speculation.

>

Of course not.  

Rants and active defamation are two issues much distinct.

I simply am exercising my legal rights in so far as I was harmed.  As it
turned out, tmp corrected the situation and was quite cooperative when we
finally talked.

Again, we have a line drawing contest here.  I just go a little father, I 
don't even think extensively father.  Frankly I don't think U.S. courts 
go much farther either.

I should be able to conduct business, without interference, in peace, 
with whomever, whenever, whatever, and however uptight, as I choose.  

Period.

The settlement was much more extensive then a mere public retraction.

And to the extent that he does so anonymously, I will have no redress.  I 
accept this.

Again, I accept this as a possibility.

As for the drug trafficking, since truth is an absolute defense to libel, 
I will have no case.

I will not sue an overseas remailer like Julf.
I will be tempted to ask a local one if tmp is indeed breaking a 
legitimate settlement agreement, I will not sue if I am refused.

Easier said than done.  Luckly I believe I have this taken care of.
