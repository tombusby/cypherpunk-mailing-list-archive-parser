How about extending the "send bogus messages" idea all the way out to the  
users of the remailer system?  Part of the price of using the remailer  
system is that you will occasionally receive a bogus message.

How might this work?

Assume remailers know the addresses of all (or most) of the other  
remailers.  In other words, assume a given remailers knows if an inbound  
message came from another remailer, or came from a non-remailer address.

All inbound messages to a remailer from a non-remailer address would be  
considered a "use" of that remailer.  A remailer would maintain a list of  
the addresses of "users" and would occasionally send bogus messages to a  
randomly selected entry from its user list.  Inclusion into the list would  
be automatic.  The list would be a large, but fixed sized FIFO, with old  
entries dropping off the end automatically.

If the remailer system uses Digital Postage, then perhaps the bogus  
message could be a token for a free Digital Stamp, good for one message.

I'm sure many will object to tracking the users of a remailer, but I don't  
see how tracking can be prevented, other than by mutual agreement.  Can we  
use tracking to *increase* privacy?
