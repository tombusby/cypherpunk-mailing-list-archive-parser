I just read an interesting product announcement:

 "The RF-5151DE digital encryption option is designed for all 
  RF-5000 FALCOM Series HF-SSB radio systems.  The module provides 
  an embedded voice-data encryption system which can be programmed 
  with up to six of 1 X 10^52 key codes.  The encryption algorithm 
  is driven by a pseudo-random key generator possessing a key 
  stream length requiring millions of years for recursion. [Harris 
  RF Communications Group, Rochester, NY, (716) 244-5830.]

This was in one of those military hardware magazines.  Does this 
sound like a piece of military gear?  Is this key length adequate 
for that?  If it were approved for the protection of classified 
information, which was never mentioned one way or the other, 
would a detail like the key length be allowed to be disclosed 
publicly?
