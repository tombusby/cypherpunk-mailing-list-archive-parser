I've seen this analogy before and I think it is a poor analogy and  
should not be used.  I don't mean for this to be a flame, just a  
comment.  The problem with this analogy is that you are comparing a  
publicly available service that is being abused with a private  
residence that is being abused.

It is the difference between "Everybody can use this remailer except  
Detweiler" and "Nobody is allowed to shout in my bedroom at 4 AM, and  
that includes Detweiler".  Do you see the difference.  The analogy is  
comparing a service with a non-service.

Since remailers are services, the analogies used to discuss them  
should compare remailers with other services.  For example:

"Detweiler is a disruptive client and I am within my rights to  
prevent him from using my service."

Right now, remailer services are free, and that generates the  
impression in some that they are public resources that *must* be  
available to all.  If remailers charged even a small amount for their  
service, it might make it easier to justify denying service to  
specific individuals.  It's not logical, but people are seldom  
persuaded by logic alone.
