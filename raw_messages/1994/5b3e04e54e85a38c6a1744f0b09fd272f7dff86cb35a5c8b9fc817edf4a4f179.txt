Important point to note about the Bill of Rights.  It was designed to
restrict the guvment not the peepul.

"Finally a Third Amendment violation after all these years of waiting --
Note that the DTI will require that you provide appropriate technologies to
the FBI, NSA and Military Intelligence (aka "soldiers") to spy on your
electronic activities for the good of the State.  Once you build a house in
a VR community, the only way that the Feds can spy on you is to adopt VR
"personalities" and live in that community and in everyone's houses so they
can see what's happening behind every "door."  After all, you can't find out
what's happening in a VR environment by reading a printout.  Under the DTI
you will have to support them in these "personalities." Thus you will be
forced to quarter them in your houses in peacetime.  Third Amendment
violation.  Question -- if you "kill" a Fed in a VR environment, is it a
crime?"
