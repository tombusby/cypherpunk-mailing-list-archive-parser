>=============================================================================
>
>A news release from Terisa Systems and SPRY --
>
>  Washington, D.C. -- Terisa Systems has announced that its SecureWeb
>Toolkits for World Wide Web transaction security will be available later
>this month.
>
>  The company also said that CyberCash Inc., Open Market Inc., O'Reilly &
>Associates, SPRY Inc., Spyglass Inc. and Verity Inc. will be the first
>companies to use the toolkits to build Web servers or clients with security
>features.
>
>  Terisa Systems was launched earlier this year by RSA Data Security Inc.
>(RSA) and Enterprise Integration Technologies Corp. (EIT). The company's
>toolkits provide an implementation of Secure HTTP (HyperText Transfer
>Protocol) for commercial products. Secure HTTP (S-HTTP), which was developed
>by EIT, is a security-enhanced version of the World Wide Web's internal
>communications language.
>
>  David Pool, president of SPRY, said S-HTTP will be incorporated into the
>company's Internet software -- Internet In A Box, the AIR Series and AIR
>Mosaic Express -- in the first quarter of 1995. Consumers using Internet In
>A Box will be able to purchase products safely over the Internet with a
>credit card. In addition, companies or publishers using the AIR Series and
>AIR Mosaic Express can market, sell and support their products. Pool said,
>"Currently, the Internet is a vast, untapped marketplace still lacking
>security and payment services. However, the S-HTTP protocol addresses both
>encryption and authentication making electronic commerce a reality for our
>customers."
>
>  According to Douglas Colbeth, president of Spyglass, his company will offer
>S-HTTP as a module in its Enhanced Mosaic Security Framework, making Mosaic
>suitable for applications requiring confidentiality and authentication.
>Enhanced Mosaic is the commercial version of NCSA Mosaic, the popular World
>Wide Web browser from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at
>the University of Illinois. Colbeth said, "Our customers see the huge
>potential in commerce on the Internet, but are very concerned about security.
>An industrial strength solution such as Secure HTTP will let Mosaic handle
>a wide range of applications requiring uncompromising security."
>
>  At O'Reilly, Dale Dougherty, publisher for the Digital Media Group, said
>S-HTTP will be used for a secure version of the GNN Direct service, that
>allows subscribers to order from publishers or advertisers who market and
>sell products over GNN Direct. He said, "We've been looking for a security
>solution that will allow our subscribers to order safely online. Secure HTTP
>provides the capabilities needed for our GNN service."
>
>  Concerning plans of other licensees, CyberCash will use the technology to
>provide a system for safe electronic payments over the Internet and Open
>Market, a developer of electronic commerce solutions, plans to sell a Web
>server that incorporates S-HTTP. Verity is introducing Verity Mosaic, a
>Mosaic client offering user authentication and secure communications for use
>with Verity's Topic Information Server for the World Wide Web, also announced
>today.
>
>  SecureWeb Toolkits include an implementation of EIT's Secure HTTP, which
>ensures the authenticity of transactions and the confidentiality of
>information exchanged via the World Wide Web. With a secure HTTP-enabled
>application, users and information providers can encrypt and sign messages
>and other material digitally. Binding agreements are possible because
>communications are secret and tamper-proof and cannot be repudiated.
>
>  SecureWeb kits incorporate RSA public key cryptography technology to permit
>spontaneous, secure communications between unfamiliar correspondents.
>SecureWeb also supports other cryptography systems such as traditional shared
>password and Kerberos. A SecureWeb run-time license is required; run-time
>license pricing is volume-based. Toolkits will be available on a limited
>basis in December 1994.
>

>infoterisa.com or telephone 415/617-1836. Additional information on Secure
>HTTP is available by sending email to <shttp@infoeit.com>.
