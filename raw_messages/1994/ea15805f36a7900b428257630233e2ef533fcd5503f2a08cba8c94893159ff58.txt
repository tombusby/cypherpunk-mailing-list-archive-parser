	MJ12 is (supposedly) the ultra-secret high-level national security 
group for the free world in charge of advanced military projects and 
most importantly -- UFO phenomena.  In UFO conspiracy circles this 
group has supposedly sold the American public to alien abductors in 
exchange for technology, science, etc.  No list of good conspirators is 
complete without it !  :)


These opinions are mine, not Microsoft's.
