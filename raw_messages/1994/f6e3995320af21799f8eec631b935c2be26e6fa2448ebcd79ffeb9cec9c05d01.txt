I think that the Steganography is just an excuse to close down the place. 
It _could_ happen, therefore we should defend against it. Of course, every
spy knows that blending in is the most important trick. It would be better
to hide the information in something bland.

On the other hand, a gif-station is one of the few types of ftp sites that
attract enough attention to drown out the one transfer from the spies.
