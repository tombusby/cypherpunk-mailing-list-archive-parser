And another big reson is that on a low income it doesn't make any
sense to use a bank, let alone credit cards. Been there myself- If
I have to worry whether there is anough money in the account to not
go negative when the monthly fee comes around, why not pay bills by
postal money order and save what little cash one can, instead of
handing it to the banks?

Opps. Not crypto. Sorry.
