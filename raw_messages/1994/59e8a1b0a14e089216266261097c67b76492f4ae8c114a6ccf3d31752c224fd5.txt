Russell,

Thought you might like to know, if you don't already know, that the Guardian
has started to produce a new weekly supplement called The Guardian OnLine,
which is "exclusively devoted to the startling developments in computing,
science and technology." The first edition (Thursday May 19) had a lot about
the Internet and the recent crackdown on the Fidonet system by Italian police.
Might be worth sending them items about cypherpunks etc.
