Political discussions tend to become elitist, or purely intellectual. Lenin,
who read Marx, discussed the problems of equality among the peasants, who 
couldn't read their shopping lists.

When 'the *_majority_* is all for' something, and you ignore that on the basis 
of minority rights, to enforce your policy you graduate from a representative
republic towards benevelant authoritarianism.

Of course, the basis of democracy, rights, and 'civilized society' is an 
educated, moderate populace, where the majority does not let issues overwhelm
their respect for those rights. But then, what happened during the McCarthy era?
