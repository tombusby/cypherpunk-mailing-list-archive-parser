Michael Paul Johnson <mpj@netcom.com> and I are wondering what happened to
<qwerty@netcom.com>. He's apparently dropped his Netcom account and thus
the handy Crypto-related files he used to keep there are not available to
the world. If anyone has any idea of the whereabouts of Mr. Qwerty and/or
his files, please contact me at <ddt@lsd.com> and fill me in, so I can
arrange to put the files back up in my FTP directory as a public service
and so Mike can update his "Where to get PGP" FAQ to reflect the new site.

Thanks,

  dave
