Earlier this morning I grabbed the latest version of Magic Money
from csn.org and compiled it under the Borland C++ 3.1 IDE. Since
the Borland C compiler is one of the more paranoid ones around, I
thought I would briefly list the things I had to do in order to
get zero warnings and zero errors.

The sources I started with were MGMNY10E.ZIP and PGPTL10C.ZIP.

After #defining MSDOS you will find that it is a good idea to
#include <stdlib.h> in almost every module.  This prototypes
quite a few of the commonly used functions which would otherwise
cause the compiler to complain.  A few modules will require
<mem.h>, <string.h>, and <time.h> since they call functions in
these modules which are not in <stdio.h> or <stdlib.h>.

The C library function "randomize" is defined in <stdlib.h>. This
conflicts with the Magic Money function of the same name which
initializes the MD5 based RNG used to generate coin ids. I
changed the name of the Magic Money one to "random_init".

There is no prototype for pgp_randombyte.  Since this function
returns "byte", not "int", this could be painful on any compiler
which treats these types of function returns differently.
Complete prototypes for (*output) and (*lookup) need to be
provided in the function header of pgp_check_sigs and also for a
different function pointer (*output) used in PGPKGEN.

The Borland compiler always warns on "if (a=b)" because it
assumes the user mistyped "if (a==b)".  To get rid of the
warning, you have to say "if (0!=(a=b)) which is optomized out by
the compiler.  This occurs in a number of places, including the
macro for multiplication mod 65537 in idea.c.

There is a reference to an undefined pgp_pubkey in fifo.c which
goes away if you #include "pgptools.h".  You then also have to
toss in "mpilib.h" and "md5.h" to make "pgptools.h" happy.

It appears that mpilib.c has been persuaded to compile the UPTON
modmult instead of the SMITH modmult.  Unfortunately, there are a
few modules which fail to #include the definition of UPTON and
still call stage_smith_modulus and smith_modmult.  Sticking in a
#define to UPTON at the top of "mpilib.h" fixes this.

The conditional code which allows prior definition of external
versions of mp_setp, mp_addc, mp_subb, mp_smul, and mp_rotl
written in assembly language for some strange reason causes the
compiler to generate externals to _P_SETP, _P_ADDC, _P_SUBB,
_P_SMUL, and _P_ROTL instead of _mp_setp, _mp_addc, _mp_subb,
_mp_smul, and _mp_rotl in modules which reference these routines.
It does not seem to have this effect in mpilib.c where these
routines are defined.  Deleting the corresponding #ifdefs cures
this.

The compiler correctly points out that pgp_extract_rsa never uses
the variable "pk" passed to it.  At the cost of a few machine
cycles, you can silence the compiler by putting "pk=pk" as the
first executable statement in this function.

The function pgp_randombyte hashes a variable "time" without
first initializing its value.  It might be nice to change "time"
to "timestamp" and do a "time(&timestamp) unless it was the
authors intention to utilize uninitialized memory.  If the server
is executed more than one time within a second, it can generate
indentical random values.  This could be a problem when
batch-processing mail. Including a fast timer register in the MD5
hash in addition to the time of day in seconds would likely
eliminate this risk.

The program uses "safemalloc" and "mm_safeopen" to access memory
and files, but does a very large number of "fread" and "fwrite"
calls without checking to see if they completed successfully.  A
"safefread" and "safefwrite" might be a good idea so the server
does not continue happily on as the hash file fills up the disk.

I was thinking I might put the DOS executables for Magic Money in
my FTP directory, in case anyone wants to play with them but
doesn't wish to compile them from source.  Send me some mail if
you would like me to do this.
