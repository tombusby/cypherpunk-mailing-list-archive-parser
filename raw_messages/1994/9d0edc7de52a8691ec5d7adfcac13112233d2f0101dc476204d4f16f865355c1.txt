There is no corporal punishment for crimes, but if you are
a prisoner and you misbehave, you will get wacked, just as
you will in most places.  In Japan they do not seem terribly
embarrassed about this.  I saw this on TV.  A bunch of prisoners
sitting perfectly still for a long period, and a guard with a cane
who wacked anyone who moved.  He did not wack them very hard.

It looked perfectly civilized to me, and I recommend the practice
to US prisons.

How can you maintain discipline in a prison otherwise?

Answer:  In US prisons there is no discipline.  Prisoners learn
to be aggressive, rude, and obnoxious to the guards and to each
other.  Good training to render them unemployable when they 
emerge.
