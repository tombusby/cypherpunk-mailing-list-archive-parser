Collusion wouldn't be necessary.  If an interested party, such as 
a "TLA" were to follow the chain backwards, seizing the logs at 
each successive link, they could eventually find the originator 
of the message.  (This assumes that the logs were detailed enough 
to record each incoming and outgoing message, and match them up.)

It is useful against after-the-fact snooping.  If they're 
monitoring you in advance, then no, it wouldn't be of much help.  
But let's say that someone were to anonymously post a portion of 
the classified Clipper algorithm to Usenet, with an indication 
that the rest was to follow in multiple installments.  There 
would be a very strong incentive for some TLA to attempt to trace 
and arrest this individual before the algorithm was further 
compromised, even if full-time monitoring of remailers wasn't 
already on their agenda.  If logs were not kept, or were securely 
destroyed often enough, then by the time the message came out in 
the clear, the data needed to trace through the early links in 
the chain would already be gone.
