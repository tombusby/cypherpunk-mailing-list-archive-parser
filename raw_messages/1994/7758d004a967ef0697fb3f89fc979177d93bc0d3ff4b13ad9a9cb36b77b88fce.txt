Amen. They also should enable people to communicate in more and better ways
with more people. MIME, HTML, Maven (phone calls over the net for free),
CU-SeeMe (video over the Net for free,) and similar tools are first
examples of how these goals might be achieved. I love email, but I would
also like to be able to see and hear from some of the friends I made all
over the world.

Twenty minutes for your mail? How fast a modem do you use?

As for solutions, the only solutions there are and ever will be involve you
getting of that terminal server. The evolution of the Internet will make
ASCII terminals obsolete. If it hasn't already done so.

Let's take that poll of what people use. I am curious.


Happy netting,

P.S. If anybody here on the list wants to know how to turn their regular
shell account into a SLIP account, email me for info or read
alt.dcom.slip-emulators. Please don't ask about it on the list.
