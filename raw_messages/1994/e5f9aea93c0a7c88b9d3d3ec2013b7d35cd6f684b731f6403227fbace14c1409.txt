Hmmm, does MIT get alt.anonymous at least ?  I understand alt.anonymous was
created to serve a purpose similar to that of alt.privacy.anon-server, but 
at the moment it's a de facto equivalent of alt.anonymous.messages. 
alt.anonymous is somewhat better propagated than a.a.m, from what I've heard.

You should request one or both groups from the MIT news admins. If users there
want to read the group, they'll likely be quite happy to carry it.

I'm a fairly well-known regular in alt.config, and I believe I can probably
recruit some prominent news admins to send booster newgroup messages for
alt.anonymous.messages. Apart from that, it's a matter of people asking their
local news admins to pick up the group if they aren't already carrying it.

Heh, I don't blame you. Although I heard they recently ditched 
alt.this.site.newgroups.everything (or something like that), they still carry
virtually everything that gets newgrouped by anyone, accidentally or not.
