  ---   T H E   K A R L   H E S S   C L U B   ---
invites you to our fourth meeting on Monday, September 19, 1994
 
Joseph Miranda asks us,
COUP D'ETAT, U.S.A.?
Soon? And...So What?
 
Seven Days in May. Now, The Enemy Within. Is a military takeover of these
United States still a possibility? Can it happen here? And...who would
care? Would a dictatorship be worse than democratic oppression? Would
State trains...or buses...run on time? Could more be privatized? Come
and find out. Feel free to join in the...interrogation!
