Most of these remarks follow from a simplistic definition of government.
My point was that the government may in some cases consist of some overt
and recognized elements and some unofficial but nonetheless real elements.
In societies in which there is a significant level of internal dissent
quasi-governmental groups spring up.  In Ireland the IRA is such a group
in many areas.	The UK government sends car thieves to prison; the IRA
kneecaps them (smashes their knees with sledgehammers or a gunshot).

The difference is only one of degree.  Either brigands smash your door
down and steal everything you have, or the IRS sends in their auditors.
On the whole, people prefer the lesser evil, the IRS, to the greater
evil, bandits.

Not as far as this discussion is concerned.  In a chaotic situation, the
fate of areas and groups will vary.  In part this will reflect differing
levels of chaos.

Even now you find many old people who regret Stalin's absence.  What I
was saying was that there was a widespread desire for peace and stability.

[There are also differences in meaning between the English word 'people'
and the Russian word usually used to translate it, 'narod'.  I was
thinking of the term 'narodnaya volya'.  Email me if you want to discuss
this further!  In-depth discussions of Russian culture seem irrelevant
to this list.]

I am aware of organized conflict.  If you want to radically change the US
government in a short period of time, it will resist you.  If you are to
succeed, you must apply a commensurate amount of force.

?  I don't think so, and in any case I don't see what you mean.

I have spent around six months in Afghanistan.	Most of this was in
Kabul, but I also visited Mazar-i-sharif, Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni,
Jelallabad, and smaller places.  The 'loose' tribal systems are in
fact very tight.  You are talking as though only national governments
were governments.  In Afghanistan the central government has normally
been very weak.  When I was there the king controlled the cities but
the chiefs controlled the villages.  The chiefs and mullahs were very
powerful indeed.

Afghanistan is a very conservative society.  Along certain lines men
are encouraged to be extreme individualists.  But the group is very
powerful.  A friend of mine lived in a village.  Families live in small
compounds with high walls around them.	The women cultivate the land
inside the walls.  A young man from the village was walking along a
high hill near the village and saw an unveiled woman working her
fields.  Someone from her family saw him and naturally took a shot
at him, because he was looking upon a woman in his family without a
veil.  For several weeks no one could step outside in that village
without being shot at, because everyone was in or related to one of
the two families involved.  This is not a loose society.
