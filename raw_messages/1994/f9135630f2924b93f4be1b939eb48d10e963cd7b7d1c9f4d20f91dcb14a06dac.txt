  I think the idea of a standard user configurable crypto-engine
is a good one..that way people could choose (and upgrade) algorythms..
sort of like modern DSP based highspeed modems..(It could also have a socket
for ROM based firmware cartridges..(RSA,IDEA,etc..) and a magstripe 
reader and keyboard for key entry..(This would make trading keys easy..)

ViaCrypt now sells three versions of a security module, one on a dongle
for a parallel port, another on a serial port, that can do all the
interesting crypto algorithms of the day. And all are fully licensed.

Send your snail mail address for glossies.
