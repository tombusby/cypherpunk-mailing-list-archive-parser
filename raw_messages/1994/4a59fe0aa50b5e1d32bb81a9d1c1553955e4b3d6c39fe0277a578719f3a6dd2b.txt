  Got this from another group.  I haven't ordered the shirt, so can't say 
yea or nay about it, but thought folks here might be interested.

It's pretty a cool shirt; the guy is a pretty wild artist on the outskirts of
Seattle. I sent him my address on email and he shipped it  c.o.d. about a
week after i I ordered it

i wore it around today...it's pretty sad how many people don't know wha
t's going on
