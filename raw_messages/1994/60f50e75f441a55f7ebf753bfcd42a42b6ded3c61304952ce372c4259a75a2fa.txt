That's real easy - I'd take Detweiler in a minute.
Sure, it takes work to filter out each incarnation of Sue D. Spoof,
and there are N-1 more like him out there,
but it's a lot less work than explaining to people why you don't have 
any intention of using the Nationalist ID Card Number in your databases,
or carrying it on your person, or presenting it when you open bank accounts,
or getting it printed on your armonce they make tattoo removal the
monopoly of the National Health Care System or whatever the paranoids
will thinnk of next.  (And *please* don't say too much of this around
politicians; they tend to miss the smileys and think this sort of thing is
a good idea....)
