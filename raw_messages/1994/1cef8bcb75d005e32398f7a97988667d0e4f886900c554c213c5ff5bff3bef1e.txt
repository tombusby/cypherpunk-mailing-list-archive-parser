Forward from Usenet. If anybody knows where to get the English
version please let me know; I'd like to make it available. I
checked, and this new version has a fix of MacPGP2.3's worst
bug, which is a System Crash when you don't have the public key
needed to check a signature, and you are using the Clipboard
feature. I started translating it with Resedit, but decided it
wasn't a half-hour job afterall, especially since I don't know
any German.

i recently purchased "Mausefalle", a UA for the MausNet, which came with a
AppleScript-able version of MacPGP. You can find it a copy (of
MacPGP2.3V1.1) in
ftp://ftp.darmstadt.gmd.de/incoming/MacPGP
not sources, so far, but some ReadMe's and signatures. The author can be
reached as Christoph_Pagalies@hh2.maus.de

I posted this, and that's all there is of the thread so far:

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I fetched that file (slowwwww).

The readme file says,

>This archive contains:

>1. MacPGP 2.3a V1.1 German version (including international language.txt
>and German readme)

>2. MacPGP 2.3a V1.1 English (including the English readme for V1.1)

>3. Documentation (English only)

Each of the three folders has been signed so you can check for any
manipulations (if you already have a previous PGP version).

Yet all I saw was a folder with the German program: MacPGP 2.3a V1.1 Q dt.
All the menus and buttons are in German, but the message window is
English.

Where's the English version? And what's the date of origin of this program?
It seems to be an independent MacPGP2.3, as it only mentions changes since
MacPGP2.2, not since MacPGP2.3v.1.0.5, which is what everybody is using
now, otherwise known as just "MacPGP2.3". No mention of fixes for bugs that
were in MacPGP2.3v.1.0.5, such as crashing during decryption using the
Clipboard feature, if you don't have the right public key to check a
signature with. We shall see (once I can read the damn menus) :-) !

P.S. If you want to know what version you have (which will turn out to be
1.0.5 if you have "MacPGP2.3"), open the program with ResEdit and look in
the "Version" resource.

P.S.S. The source code for MacPGP2.3 has always only been labeled as
version 1.0.4! Does this mean the version I'm using has no source code
available? I guess the NSA didn't want us to know what they put in there?
