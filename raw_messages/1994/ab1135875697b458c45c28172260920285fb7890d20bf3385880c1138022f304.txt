Wrong.  (sorry to sound so authoritative; just wanted to make my position
clear.)  If you knew how to perform the split, there would be no need for
a meet-in-the-middle attack; you could just attack each of the DES
encryptions of the split data separately.

Recall that a meet-in-the-middle attack is a method for cryptanalyzing a
message that has been doubly encrypted, as the following:

	I = E0_K0(P)
	C = E1_K1(I)

By this nomenclature, I mean to imply that not only the keys but also the
algorithms may be different between the first and second encryptions.
Meet-in-the-middle works by encrypting from P towards I, decrypting from
C towards I, and attempting to meet in the middle.  For algorithms with
large keyspaces, this attack requires so much memory for storing
intertext as to be almost absurd in today's world, but it is a valuable
theoretical technique for demonstrating that double encryption provides
little more computational security than single encryption.

I am claiming that your technique:

	P0, P1, P2, ... Pn = S_KS(P)

	C0 = E_K0(P0)
	C1 = E_K1(P1)
	C2 = E_K2(P2)
	.   .   .
	Cn = E_Kn(Pn)

Can be decomposed into parallel double encryptions, and is therefore just
as vulnerable to a meet-in-the-middle attack as double DES (or more so,
if your splitting algorithm is less secure than DES).  NB:  When I use
the term "double encryption" here, I am not referring to your use of DES
multiple times after the split; I am referring to the splitting itself as
the first encryption, and the DES as the second encryption.  Let us
define the function Sx_KS(P) as the portion of the splitting algorithm
which produces Px:

	P0 = S0_KS(P)
	P1 = S1_KS(P)
	.   .   .

We now have a parallel set of double encryptions as follows:

	P0 = S0_KS(P)
	C0 = E_K0(P0)

	P1 = S1_KS(P)
	C1 = E_K1(P1)

	.   .   .

Each of these double encryptions is vulnerable to a known-plaintext
meet-in-the-middle attack from P to Cx.

In my above argument, I assumed a splitting key which is completely
independent of the DES keys.  This will be more secure than a splitting
key which is *any* function of the DES keys, since it increases the size
of the keyspace.

If you still maintain this position, then either you have not understood my
argument above, or I seriously misunderstand your algorithm.  If you have
not yet been convinced that you have not eliminated the meet-in-the-middle
attack as triple encryption does, then I welcome your algorithm in code, so
that I may see if I am missing something fundamental in your approach.
However, I strongly suggest that you review meet-in-the-middle attacks as
described by Merkle and Hellman and judge for yourself their applicability
to and effectiveness against your algorithm.

The security of the generation of the splitting key from the DES keys is
almost irrelevant.  You can guarantee that the splitting key is completely
uninferable from the DES keys by making them independent, yet the
split+encrypt algorithm is still as weak as (or weaker than) double DES.
