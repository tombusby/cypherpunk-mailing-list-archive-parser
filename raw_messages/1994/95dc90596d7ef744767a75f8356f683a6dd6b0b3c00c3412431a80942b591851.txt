Well, as one who owns an AOR 1000 radio frequency scanner that can receive
any and all cell phone conversations, I would have to say you have no
security unless you use some kind of voice encryption. In order to make you
can feel warm and safe, the manufacture or importation of scanners with
cell phone capability was outlawed by congress earlier this year, which
means that I can still listen to your call with my existing scanner while
you feel protected. I bought guns with high capacity magazines this year
after they were banned also. I wish I had enough money to buy a good
assault rifle before they're all over priced (they'll never be all gone,
just over priced.)
