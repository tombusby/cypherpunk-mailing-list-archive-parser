   No NSA equipment needed. A simple scanner and some software can be
used to track which cell you are in. They didn't have to triangulate
OJ's position or anything, they only needed to know which cell he was in,
and the direction he was traveling. The rest is simple.

(you can find such software on hack/phreak BBSes already. The only
personal information needed is the telephone # of the cell phone)
