It's interesting to me that these are all arguments most of the 
anti-clipper types on 'punks have been bringing up from the beginning.

Mr. May and another poster have brought up the newbie complaint that no one 
wants to debate current issues, and another poster again brought up the 
good post, bad response syndrome.  (Sorry I can't provide specific 
credit)  Perhaps this is part of the "problem."

Normally 'punks are right on these issues as they develop.  There are a 
few regular "collectors" or "rainmakers" on the list that bring in 
prospective problems and issues before they hit the mass media with any 
force.  There are others who bring up the issues way in advance only 
analytically, putting the pieces together to spot the issues before they 
ever hit the media, or the policy makers.  (Note that I don't assert the 
issues flow in this order :)  )

It seems that the 'punks are on top of the issues 3 months to a year in 
advance consistently.  (Perhaps a 1-900 number should be started?  The
cypherpunk psychic friends network maybe?)  This to me is one of the 
great advantages and bonuses of the nexus between politics and 
cryptography on the list.  (Note that I'm the worst political distraction 
offender.)

By the time most newbies get on the list, and want to talk about current 
events, they are old and cold on the list.  I think sometimes the list 
forgets the great sources, intellects and perspectives that float about 
and as a result there isn't a great deal of sympathy for the newbies.  
Are the cypherpunks a touch spoiled?

Regardless, I think Mr. May's idea for the golden oldies is a sound one.  

No one wants to rehash all the old arguments again and again.  I don't 
know if a FAQ is the right approach or not, I though more like a quick 
summary of arguments on each side of each issue, or more to Mr. May's 
structure (I think) the original "essays" on the topics in question.

Perhaps majordomo could be convinced to send a pointer to the "FAQ" or 
"Introduction to cypherpunks" with each subscribe request?

This is apt analysis.

To me the issue is one of Canadian sovereignty and economic independence 
despite NAFTA and outside the trade relations with America.  The worst 
part of NAFTA for the Canadians (IMHO) was the initial, short-term economic
dominance.  You can see in the statement that the Canadian's hardly respect
or are likely to abide by American market influence when it has little to do
with free trade.  Make an economic treaty with the United States and you get
some U.S. market regulation as well.  Even if the treaty is about free trade
to begin with.

It still interests me that the list can be so on target and attuned to 
the policy issues as to basically predict the response of non-American 
governments.  Perhaps the policy makers are using the wrong advisors.  
Then again, it is right in line with American pomposity that the U.S. 
policy makers either assume the rest of the world will fall in line, 
assume they have the right analysis and perspective over all the other 
inputs, or don't care one way or the other.

One country's geek is another country's policy maker?

Or did the former Canadian miss Woodstock too?
