tentacle, you've got the cutest little tentacle
I ate some stamps and now my life's not dull, tentacle
you're an anarchist medusa
I use crypto to confuse ya
tentacle!
your headers bouncing through my sendmail-dot-c-f!
we do not see your puss
'cos you're anon-y-mous
with your little tentacle!

tentacle, you've got the cutest little tentacle
in fact I see you've got your hands quite full, tentacle
as the newsgroups I see you fill
I would hate to get your phone bill
tentacle!
typing on fifteen keyboards, seen in 50 states!
Rick Wakeman envies you!
Wave hi to Elvis too,
with your little tentacle!
