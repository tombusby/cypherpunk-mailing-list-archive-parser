This is from the djgpp (DOS port of gcc) mailinmg list, posted by the
author of said port himself. It's short enought to post and might be 
helpful to some. Flames will be forwarded to postmaster@intel.com.

Subject: Intel recalls Pentium
Status: RO

CNN reported this weekend that Intel has announced that they will
replace ALL defective Pentium(tm) processors, no questions asked.  To
determine if your Pentium(tm) is devective, run the attached MS-DOS
program FDIVBUG1.COM (source included also).  It will tell you if you
have the bug and where to call for a replacement if needed.
