    I got this recently, but hesitated to post, after previously
    being told by folks on the hardware list "thats too much".
    Perhaps not, compared to the RNG-810 that Paul Elliot spoke of.

> How the RNG works
> The Random Number Generator consists of two independent analogue 
> Zener diode based noise sources. Both signals are converted into random bit 
> streams, combined and subsequently transmitted in the form of bytes to the 
> RS-232 port of your computer. Special timing circuits ensure that crucial 
> logical operations occur at  moments that the device has stable signals.
> The baud rate is 9600. So the device is capable of supplying you with about 
> 960 random bytes or 7600 random bits per second
> Power is drawn from the RTS and TXD signal. (pins 4 and 2 of the D-25 
> connector). In order to work properly the RTS signal should be high (5 volts 
> or higher) and one should not send bytes to the device!
> 
> WARNING: part of the RNG is shielded. It is not recommend to open the 
> device. It is not allowed to copy or use the design of the RNG without 
> written permission of the developer, the Foundation for Fundamental 
> Research on Man and Matter (FREMM).
> 
> The testdata
> Each RNG passes a 256 run randomness test before being shipped. Each run 
> consists of 8192 samples. The unselected results of this test are included 
> with the package. If at the end of the test runs the cumulative first order 
> deviation is larger than 1.5 standard deviations the RNG is tested another 20 
> times. If it is accepted after these 20 tests this will be indicated.

> How to connect the RNG to the computer
> The RNG is functionally similar to a 'crazy' modem producing random 
> information to your machine. It should be connected like any modem. In 
> some cases when the computer has a standard D-25 male connector you can 
> plug the RNG directly into that connector. In other cases (e.g.. for Apple 
> machines) you have to connect the RNG through a standard modem cable.
