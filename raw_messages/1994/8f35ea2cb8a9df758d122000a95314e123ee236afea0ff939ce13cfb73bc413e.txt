Technically it is that easy.  Cellular phones only "hop frequencies"
when they are mobile.  In other words as I am driving along the
highway my phone is changing frequencies as I change cells.  If I am
stationary, however, my phone will most likely stay on one frequency
within that cell.  However, the MTSO (Mobile Telephone Switching
Office) may command my phone to change to a different frequency if
another user moves into my cell and the MTSO "decides" that my current
frequency would be better allocated to the other user.

In any case, there are two solutions to tracking the frequency of a
particular cellular user.  First, and most expensive.  Get the users
ESN (Electronic Serial Number) from the phone and listen in on the
control channel.  I do not know how the control data is modulated on
the control frequency, but once you can decode that data you can "see"
the MTSO command the phone to change frequencies and cells.  Secondly,
simply get a frequency counter and a yagi antenna.  By pointing the
antenna at the cellular antenna you should be able to get the
frequency the phone is currently on.  When the phone switches
frequencies, simply follow the same procedure.  Labor intensive, but
cheap!  Note, these are general ideas based on what I know about
cellular.  I am most definetely *not* an expert on cellular technology.

I would be willing to bet that it would be "fairly" easy for the
average techie to be able to intercept and decode your PD's data.  And
only a "little" more difficult to spoof one of the mobile data
terminals.  If they are using off-the-shelf hardware then you can
assume that you could buy the same hardware!
