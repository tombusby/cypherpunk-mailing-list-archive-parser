        I found Tim's post the other day on why he quit the extropians list
a tad offensive. In a forum where no one is interested in the particulars,
he brought up the old "Extropian Dogma" argument.

        It would be unreasonable of me to argue the point, as it would be
far off topic in this forum to refute him.

        I would like to state, however, that I dislike the his stating
his ignorance and then pronouncing his opinion as fact. (Or more
annoyingly, in the reverse order.)

        Tim, you are well aware that I read the cypherpunks list, and that I
would interpret the jibe 'certain folks were treating the "Extropian
Principles 2.0" as a kind of catechism to be quoted to doubters' as aimed
at myself, since you levelled that charge at me at the time. Is this a
deliberate attempt to insult me? In a forum that would be difficult to
reasonably defend myself? A tactic hardly worthy of you.

In spite of the fact that I would like to "set the record straight" on some
of your assertions, I refuse to debate this terribly one sided
representation of these events. Events that entailed some of the worst
behavior I've ever seen from all parties, particularily from you, Mr. May.

IMO, levelling these assertions up out of nowhere, for no reason, is not a
way to stay on good terms.

- A somewhat pissed plaz, who still maintains he is not, nor has ever been,
dogmatic about the damned Extropian Principles.
