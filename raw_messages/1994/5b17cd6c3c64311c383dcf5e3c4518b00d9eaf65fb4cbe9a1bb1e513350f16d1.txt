The following is an excerpt from the the result of 
"finger remailer.help.all@chaos.bsu.edu":

<begin excerpt>
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anonymous postings to usenet can be made by sending anonymous mail to one of
the following mail-to-usenet gateways (but the news gateways themselves do
not make the message anonymous):

group.name@demon.co.uk
group.name@news.demon.co.uk
group.name@bull.com
group.name@cass.ma02.bull.com
group.name@charm.magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu
group.name@comlab.ox.ac.uk
group.name@myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu (Supports crossposting)
group.name@paris.ics.uci.edu (removes headers)
group.name.usenet@decwrl.dec.com (Preserves all headers)
group.name@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca (?)
group.name@nic.funet.fi (?)
group.name@cs.dal.ca (?)
group.name@ug.cs.dal.ca (?)

The mail-to-news gateways do not anonymize messages; you must use a
remailer if you want the message to be posted anonymously.
Not all gateways support all newsgroups.  You may have to try several
to find one that supports the groups you wish to post to.
It would also be advisable to try a post to alt.test before relying on
any such system to function as expected.  Also note the special syntax
required at dec.com (add .usenet).

In addition, you can cross-post to several newsgroups by adding the header
Newsgroups: with the names of the groups you want to post to and sending
it to mail2news@demon.co.uk or mail2news@myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu
(Use the ## feature with the remailers to add the header line)

There's also the UTexas CS mail-to-news gateway (not sure why it's not on
this list). Basic format is (note use of '-' in place of '.' in group names):
group-name@cs.utexas.edu
