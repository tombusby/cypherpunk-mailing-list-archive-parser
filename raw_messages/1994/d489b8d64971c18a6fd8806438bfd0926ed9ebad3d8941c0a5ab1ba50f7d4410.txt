I'm leaving for now, but I thought I'd share this with you.
Even though you get !!!!! in all your mail, you can't really
use the ! in your mail command.
I tried to mail to someone!account@system.net and I got an
"Event not found" error.  So I made this up:


mail !Superbowl
Superbowl: Event not found
