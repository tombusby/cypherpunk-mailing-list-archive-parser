AMS is pretty strongly tied to AFS (now known as part of DCE) and is
geared towards sites with users in the thousands.  It's probably not
what you want, even if it were available  (CMU is in the process of
phasing it out, since their user base usage has exceeded the design
limitations of AMS).

Take a look at newsgate, available somewhere on ftp.uu.net.  All you
have to do is set up a pseudo-site in your news server's newsfeeds file
and send the messages through news2mail.

It totally depends upon the configuration of the gateway and the format
of the message.  If your gateway passes Control: headers, then cancels
will be forwarded to the user and perhaps even be effective if they
have another mail-to-news gateway up (that allows Control: headers).
Even more so for cancels of the "Subject: cmsg cancel" format, since
everything passes Subject: headers.
