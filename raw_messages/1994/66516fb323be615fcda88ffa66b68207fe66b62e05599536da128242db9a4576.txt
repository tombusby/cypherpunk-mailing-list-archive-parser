	 Get real.  With very few exceptions, the entire American political
	 spectrum is made up of liberals.  That most certianly includes
	 Reagan, MaCarthy, definitly Nixon, and mabey Hoover.

``When *I* use a word,'' Humpty Dumpy said, in rather a scornful tone,
``it means just what I choose it to mean---neither more nor less.''

Reagan, McCarthy, Nixon and Hoover wouldn't call themselves liberals.
We liberals certainly don't number them in our ranks.  To call them
``liberals'' is to deny all meaning to the word.  (Not that it's definition
is clear -- but they sure aren't included.)
