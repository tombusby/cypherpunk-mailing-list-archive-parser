I believe that these properties of document security are orthogonal to
transport security. Today we have bit off transport security. Using MIME
multipart encoded documents, document security can be handled as well. There
already exist standards defining the format for these (PEM etc.), all that is
missing is a browser that adheres to them, and some server based tools for
creating them. SSL combined with those provides a powerful solution to todays
Internet problems (jeesh, now *I'm* starting to sound like a marketing person
:)

Agreed. However, today, we consider it a primary concern instead of a secondary
concern. To do business on the Internet, people will be filling in forms and
submitting data that is sensitive to server operators. We don't want that data
to be observered in transit. Data that is paid for should also be private.

I tend to agree here, but before I open something up to wide discussion I
prefer to have a smaller group doing the review work. After the small group
work has been done, then a larger review follows.

I think RSA pulled a fast one on you. We don't use TIPEM. We wrote the X.509
handling code ourselves and have tested it for interoperability. In any case,
there are two classes of net consumers out there: the academia and corporation.
The academia can almost always get access to source code for free and reuse it
interesting manners with little trouble, as long as it's academic. Us business
types get stuck paying for everything (of course we make a living that way
too...). It doesn't bother me that people would have to license RSA technology
to implement SSL commercially. We did, and in some sense it levels the playing
field.

However, in defense of SSL, I must say that there is no strict requirement for
RSA technology. A careful reading of the spec will lead one to discover that
different public-key technologies can be used. Since certificates are typed,
and standard X.509 certificates include algorithm identifiers, it is possible
to implement a different authentication mechanism that doesn't use RSA
technology.

For example, to choose some popular choices (:^), one could use SHS instead of
MD5, skip-jack instead of RC2/RC4/IDEA and some other freely available public
key algorithm.

My point was that in order to even play on the internet, one needs a computer,
a network connection, and TCP/IP, *PLUS* all of the various software that one
wishes to use to communicate. This is not free. It is being paid for by you
whether you do it directly, or it is built into the margins of the hardware
manufaturer that sold you the machine.

Actually, 2 people from DEC, one from EIT and 2 from RSA.

I'm listening! What is wrong with SSL? What defects does it have in the way
that it tries to solve privacy and authentication? What should we do to make
the next version better?
