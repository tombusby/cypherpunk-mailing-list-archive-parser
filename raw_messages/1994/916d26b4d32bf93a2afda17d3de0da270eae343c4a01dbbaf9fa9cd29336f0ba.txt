I agree.

Entropy, like velocity, is relative.  `Non-deterministic' is the label we
apply to the unknown or possibly unknowable.  Non-deterministic algorithms
(or thought experiments) work by `knowing more than we do'.  They guess the
un-guessable: the correct answers to problems we can't solve readily any
other way.  From their point of view, for some reason, it's not
un-guessable.  This very attribute makes them un-guessable to us.

We simulate `guessing' correctly by exhaustive search (check out, e.g.,
NFA's and pattern matching).  "Is P==NP?" is roughly equivalent to "For
every problem that you could `guess' the answer if only you knew how---and
can prove the answer correct without guessing---is there a shortcut (that
meets some strong criterea)?"

If P==NP is ever proven it _will_ have an impact on a large class of
problems (and the effect will depend on the nature of the proof), but not
all problems.  Some problems are harder than NP, e.g. decrypting a message
encrypted with a truly random OTP.  Even if you guess the correct
decryption, you can't prove it's right without guessing.

Currently, lacking `THE shortcut', P != NP (in the practical sense; _not_
the theoretical).  Even if it becomes the case that, demonstrably, P == NP
in both the practical and theoritical sense, the world will still be an
interesting place (in both the practical and theoretical sense).
