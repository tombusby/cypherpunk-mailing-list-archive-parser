Well, I have _never_ said that anyone can "lay claim to ownership" of
a conversation! I had hoped I had made this clearer.

Think of a coffehouse. Perhaps in Vienna in the 1920s and 30s, when
the Vienna Circle was meeting....Wittgenstein, Freud, Carnap,
Reichenbach, Popper, others. Nobody "owned" their conversation, but
certainly the coffeehouse owner was free to set his polices, his
"two-espresso minimums," whatever.

Clearer?

This is why I specifically mentioned Mosaic, WWW, and other "future"
systems. This is why "Pushing the Limits" was part of the title of my
thread. I don't see Hal's point here....I am not just focussing on the
current approach to mailing lists. This is why the broader issues of
cyberspace are so interesting.

Both Hal and I left the Extropians list, for whatever reasons. But
saying that things can lose value is not inconsistent with the
ownership of the forum or place....that was my Fry's Electronics
example. Fry's does not "own" its customer base, and it could easily
lose it. But it owns its own places of businesses and thus can set
policies without "democratic input" from other folks who _claim_ to
own a part of it.

I agree with Hal here.

But on the issue of "ownership," laws will play a small role. Crypto
will provide the key. Regions in cyberspace will be "owned" by the
"right of arms" of the creators/colonizers being the ones able to
control access, limit behaviors, etc.

Of course, no one can be forced to visit "Tim's Cyberspace
Coffeehouse." But if they do, a la the Fry's Electronics or Vienna
examples, it's "my house, my rules."

It's amazingly straightforward.
