Recently, somebody mentioned writing scripts to assist in using the
remailers (I deleted the message and can't remember who it was).  

I used to keep a remailer list, and generated simple unix Bourne shell
scripts and DOS batch files to do exactly this; however, I'm cleaning
up my account and now defer to superior products: (Matt Ghio's and
Raph Levien's remailer lists are better, and Hal Finney's chain
program is more functional than the scripts).

But, if they may be of some use to somebody, I just made available the
various PERL scripts, makefiles, etc. I once used to generate the
above mentioned scripts.  It is available via anonymous ftp at
chaos.bsu.edu in pub/cypherpunks/incoming as klb.scripts.tar.gz.  The
remailer data file included is fairly old and will need updating if
somebody wants to toy with the scripts, etc.
