Perhaps, though I doubt it. I still think that "incentivising" (I just love
this word) the use of crypto on this list will lead to better tools and
therefore to more people in the world at large using crypto. Since that is
what we all want, can't we at least give it a try? There is nothing to lose
and everything to gain.
