In case anyone's interested, the magazine PC Answers (issue 7, Sept 94)
here in England has a copy of PGP 2.6 on a cover disk, along with the 
Windows front end: PGP WinFront from Ross Barclay.

This appears to be the 'plain' version, no suffix.  If it wasn't supposed
to be exported from the USA, it's leaked in a big way!  According to the 
RSA and MIT licences included, it's available for any non-commercial use.

Looks like I'll start using PGP in earnest.
Has anyone any advice on how to get my public key 'trusted', since I
don't know anyone else who already has a trusted key?  Similarly, how
do I know when to trust keys I receive, given that I have no keys yet that
I 'trust'?

Cheers,
