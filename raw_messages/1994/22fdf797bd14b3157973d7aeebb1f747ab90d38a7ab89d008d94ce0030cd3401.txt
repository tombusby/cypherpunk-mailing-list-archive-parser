Oh, I sure hope the spooks are listening, but I don't intend that
their knowing the protocol will help them cheat at cards any more then
having the PGP source will let them read messages encrypted by it.
That is what cryptography is all about.

Note, depending on how things land thrid parties might have no
difficulty watching the play without a superencrypting--I don't yet
know.
