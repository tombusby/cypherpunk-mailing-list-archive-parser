It seems that the Government of the USA has been interfering
with the free market to reward AT&T , I don't know how much
AT&T's support of the Clipper Chip had to do with it but I'm
sure it didn't hurt.  In the May 13 New York Times:
        
        >The AT&T Corporation's winning bid for a $4 billion contract to
        >modernize Saudi Arabia's phone system ,WHICH HAD BEEN SUPPORTED
        >BY HEAVY CLINTON ADMINISTRATION LOBBYING , was hundreds of
        >millions of dollars higher than other bids [...] The huge-scale
        >deal, which was announced on Monday is the biggest
        >telecommunications contract in history.
        
I think it's important for company's to realize there is also a
downside for supporting Clipper. As a start ,I don't see how any
self respecting Cypherpunk or Extropian could use AT&T as their
personal long distance carrier . AT&T 's not the only company in
bed with the government over Clipper (INTEL) but it is the most
visible and the easiest to boycott, MCI and Sprint do a fine
job. If  5% of the Internet users quit AT&T it would make other
companies think twice before they endorse Clipper.
