"Fewer" enemies? Yugoslavia is now split into at least 5 pieces. Before we
only needed to monitor the line from Moscow to Tito. All the orders came 
down this line and Yugoslavia did what they were told, more or less. No one
in the US had to seriously wonder about the differences between Bosnia, Serbia,
Croatia etc... We didn't need to monitor the different governments in the
different regions.  

The ex-SU is now split into too many pieces for me to count. Some of them
have nuclear weapons that they don't want to turn over. Others have military
ships. Before, it was enought to have a good presence in Moscow. Now you
need to be in Kiev, Lvov, Talinn, etc... 

North Korea, the Mid East and Cuba are the only places that still need the
same amount of attention that they needed during the Cold War. This is
because they're already maxed out.
