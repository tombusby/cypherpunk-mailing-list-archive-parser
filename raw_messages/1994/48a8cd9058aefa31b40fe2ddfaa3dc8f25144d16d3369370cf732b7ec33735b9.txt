Is there a newer version of winpgp than 1.0?  I've found what appears to be
several bugs in 1.0:

	1) if I attempt to encrypt more than one file, winpgp says
	   "Illegal function call" and terminates.

	2) if I encrypt a file with "Binary" checked, the resulting
	   file is named "<whatever>.PGP".  If I attempt to decrypt
	   this .PGP file, winpgp will only allow me to encrypt .PGP
	   files, but not decrypt them.

	3) if I encrypt a file with "ASCII" checked, the resultng
	   file is named "<whatever>.ASC".  If I decrypt this file,
	   pgp gives me an error message (apparently pgp is being called
	   with the "-d" option).  If I decrypt it by hand without the
	   "-d" option, PGP loses the file extension; i.e., XXX.DOC
	   encrypts to XXX.ASC, but decrypts to just XXX without the
	   .DOC extension.

I'm using pgp 2.6 and winpgp 1.0 running under windows 3.11 (workgroups).
Please email directly, as I don't have access to the list from work.

Thanks in advance for any assistance... :)
