	 Someone has just pointed out to me that the basic PKP patents (D-H
	 especially) expire relatively soon now (the D-H patent was issued in 1
	980).

	 Seems to me this is a strong motivation for the gov to get Clipper in 
	place
	 now; three years from now all the places that won't use PGP because of
	 legal
	 tangles will be able to use it free and clear!

No.  The basic patent on public key cryptography and the patent on
Diffie-Hellman key exchange expire in 1997 (the former on April 28;
the latter on August 18).  PGP uses RSA, which is protected until
September 19, 2000.
