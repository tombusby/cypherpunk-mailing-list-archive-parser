The importance is that the current justification for Clipper is

1. The benevolent government wanted us to have very good encryption
    so they gave us SKIPJACK, but 
2. They didn't want to hurt themselves by giving away something that
    they couldn't crack.

The Clipper apologists have retreated from the "we are going to use this
to catch criminals" posture to "let's give the citizens good encryption that
doesn't hurt us".  PGP et al was a devastating answer to the first position,
so that is why they abandoned it.  Blaze's result destroys the current
justification, they are giving us good encryption that they can't break.

There is then no reason to push Clipper, unless it is fixed, of course.
