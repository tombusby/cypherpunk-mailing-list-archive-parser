This is encouraging, that the LA area is talking about having a
meeting.

I'm looking for a good excuse to visit the LA area (besides visiting
my brother, who got nuked out of his last place by the quake and now
lives near the beach in Hermosa Beach!). If this event is scheduled
enough in advance (2 weeks, say), I'd like to attend it. A couple of
LA-area folks (JPP, Matt Bartley, I think) have attended the Bay Area
meeting, so some cross-fertilization in the other direction might be
nice.

So, mid-May? 

--Tim May, who may attend in May.
