Stuff about the AA BBS bust elided.

One should note that this prosecution is similar to others carried out
against the sellers of physical visual pornography for years.  The stings
have been carried out by both Republican and Democratic federal prosecutors
usually in border states.  They started before there was an official
Religious Right.  The US Attorney in this case may have been a Democrat
since most Republicans were replaced by Clinton.  He, she, or it is probably
not a member of the RR.

There will be an appeal.

That will be an interesting case.
