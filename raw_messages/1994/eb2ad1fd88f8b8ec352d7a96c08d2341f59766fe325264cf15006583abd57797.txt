Is the AMS software (or some similar system) available as freeware or 
shareware somewhere ?  I'm considering the possibilities for anonymized 
subscription to newsgroups through a mechanism like this. Come to think of it,
many newsgroups are gatewayed to related mailing lists for readers on BBSes 
and such; I need to search a bit for the software used to do this.

I'm curious how such systems deal with cancellation messages; presumably they
would simply have to drop them. This would partially eliminate the threat of
spam-of-cancels attacks I mentioned earlier.
