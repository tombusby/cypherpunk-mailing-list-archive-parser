It occured to me, and I'm probably not the first, that it would be
quite a resource to have a finger server that dumps the last ping
responses for the active remailers.

Would it be difficult to cook up a script that pings the remailers
every 12 or 24 hours and then stores the "last ping received" data
and dumps it on a remote finger command?

I would myself but I dont have the hardware resources :(
My programming leaves much to be desired as well.

Problems?
Comments?
