This is kind of like the "internet drive-up window" ATM gateway idea my
cronies and I were throwing around.  The funds transfer happens between the
vendor and buyer's banks through an ATM/internet gate, probably owned by a
bank. The WWW/secure mosaic "wallets" and "cash registers" would be given
away.

I keep insisting that an ATM gate offer the option of ecash in the
transaction, with us as the underwriter of the cash, even though my more
"practical" associates offered your rationale for not doing it...

They seem to be winning the argument at the moment. ;-).
