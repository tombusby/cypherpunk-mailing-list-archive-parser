There appear to be two existing steganography packages for images.
One is "jsteg", a Unix-based system which stores data in JFIF-
compliant JPEG images; it is based on version 4 of the cjpeg/djpeg
package.  The other is "Stego", a Mac-based system which stores data
in Mac PICT files (I think---I don't have a Mac to examine it).

"jsteg" is available in the Cypherpunks FTP archive in the
applications subdirectory as the original jpegsrc package, plus the
patches, plus a README file.  However, you might be better off
tracking down the "Stego" sources since "jsteg" stores its data in a
rather odd way (see the docs for more information).
