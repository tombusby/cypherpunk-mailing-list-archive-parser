I don't understand what you mean by "specific notion of randomness  
hasn't been specified".  How many different "notions of randomness"  
are there?

I agree.  The output of the reverse stego process should produce  
similar results, regardless of the presence of a hidden message.   
That's the point I've been trying to make.  I've been attempting to  
make that point by describing a hypothetical stego system that, when  
run in reverse, produces a random sequence of bits.  I suppose there  
could be other hypothetical stego systems that produce non-random  
output, but then you would need a decryption system that could  
understand and decrypted that non-random output.  I prefer random bit  
sequences.  Or perhaps I should say - bit sequences with no apparent  
structure.

I agree completely.   This is a large part of what makes effective  
steganography so difficult to achieve.
