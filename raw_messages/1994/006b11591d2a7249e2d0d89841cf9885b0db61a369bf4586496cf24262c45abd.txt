> cool that there'll be chicks hanging around me all the time...
> Maybe I'll even get a car, or put up the bestest BBS in the

> all of this out loud, and that a small band of rogues had been

> had left to pursue other activities, due to the rather self-
> exciting nature of his mostly derailed train of thought, the rogues
