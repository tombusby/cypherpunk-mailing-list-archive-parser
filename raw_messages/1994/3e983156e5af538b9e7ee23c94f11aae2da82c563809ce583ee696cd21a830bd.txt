Hello Everyone!

	Thanks to Patrick Oonk (kafka@desert.hacktic.nl), I would like to 
announce the creation of a new anonymous mail/usenet server. This server 
is based on the PGP-compatible Cypherpunk mail servers and operates with 
the same set of commands. The address to this new server is 
remailer@jpunix.com. Here is a brief description of how to use the server:

    How to use the Cypherpunks Remailers
    ------------------------------------
    by Hal Finney, <74076.1041@compuserve.com>

There are two general ways of specifying the remailing instructions.
The simplest is to add an extra field to the header of the message.
All of the Cypherpunks remailers will accept the field name
"Request-Remailing-To:".  (Several of the remailers also accept shorter
versions of this name, but there is no standard for the short versions
accepted.)  Simply put the address that you want the mail to be forwarded
to after "Request-Remailing-To:" in the message header, and the forwarding
will be done.  (Case is important in this header field, so be sure to put
in the capital letters as shown.)
This remailer software also supports "X-Anon-To:".

Many people have mailers which will not allow them to add fields to the
headers of the messages they send.  Instead, they can only put material
into the bodies of the mail.  In order to accomodate such systems, the
Cypherpunks remailers provide a mechanism for "pasting" the first few
lines of the message body into the header.  These lines can then contain
"Request-Remailing-To:" / "X-Anon-To:" commands.

This is done by having the first non-blank line of your message be the
special token "::" (two colons).  If the Cypherpunks remailers see this
as the first non-blank line, all following lines up to a blank one
will be pasted into your mail header.  Then the message will be processed
as usual.  Here is how the message above would be prepared if Sue were
not able to add lines to her outgoing message header.

This new server will also support posting to USEnet in the form:

Request-Remailing-To: news.group

where news.group is the newsgroup the user wishes to post to.

If you have any problems or questions, feel free to contect me at 
perry@jpunix.com. Please find the public key of the new server listed 
below for those of you wishing to encrypt to the server.
