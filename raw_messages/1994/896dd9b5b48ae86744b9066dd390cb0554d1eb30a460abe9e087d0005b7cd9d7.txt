E-MAIL AT THE WHITE HOUSE
        Both the Bush and Clinton administrations have tried to restrict
public access to White House e-mail, but later this year the National
Security Agency will publish "White House E-Mail," a book-length collection
of e-mail messages.  The book includes Iran-Contra affair communications to
and from Oliver North, who used e-mail because he thought it could be
easily deleted. One message from him reads: 

"Oh lord. I lost the slip and
broke one of the high heels. Forgive please. Will return the wig on
Monday."  (So who needs the Clipper Chip?) (New York Magazine, 6/6/94 p.20)
----------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^---------------------------------

I guess the spirit of J. Edgar Hoover lives on at the Whitehouse <hehehe>
