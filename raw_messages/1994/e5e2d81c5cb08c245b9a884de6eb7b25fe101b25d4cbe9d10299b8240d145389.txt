Some agent periodically sends out several hundred line remailer ping messages
(unencrypted) with many hops planned; a sample is included below. It would be
nice if the parties responsible would remove my address (and, for example,
Eric Frias' address and the leri address) since I'm not operating a remailer 
at this address any longer. Adding in the newer remailers might be a wise move
if this is supposed to produce results representative of the entire remailer 
bramble. In the immortal words of Kibo, "PLEASE UPDATE YOUR COSMIC PARAMETERS."
Thanks.
