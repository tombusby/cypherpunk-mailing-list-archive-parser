Let me say a word in defense of Mitch Kapor and Jerry Berman, since
they are not here to defend themselves. 

The EFF believes the government will insist that digital cash be
traceable, via the "Digial Cash Forfeiture" proposal. They thus saw no
point in fighting this system, it being innevitable, and have been
instead helping to make the system more fair and more secure.

I hope this clears things up.

Just a joke, before someone gets all worked up. Call me a "one issue
voter" if you will, but I think the EFF has given up without a fight
on the Digital Telephony battle, and through its "help" made it more
palatable to the Congressrodents. Hence, the EFF helped to get it
passed (last I heard, earlier today, the House had passed it by voice
vote and the Senate was on the verge of taking it up...it may be
passed by now).

EPIC, CPSR, ACLU, and Shabbir Safdar's "Voters Telecomm Watch" have
not shied away from the battle the way the EFF has. 

I don't know what got into the EFF. Potomac fever? Altitude sickness?
