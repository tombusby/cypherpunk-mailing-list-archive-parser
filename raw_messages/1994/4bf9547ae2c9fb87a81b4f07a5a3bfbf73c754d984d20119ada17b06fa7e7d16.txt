Just a short announcement culled from the minutes of the last RMIUG
meeting.  It's of greatest interest to those of us in CO.  I
suppose the panelists on the list already know about it (but one
can never be completely sure).

|| The next RMIUG meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, September 13th.
|| We will have a "Crypto-Fest" panel discussion organized by RMIUG
|| member Duane Thompson (ak351@freenet.hsc.colorado.edu),
|| including Phil DuBois, lawyer for Phil Zimmerman, author of the
|| encryption program Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), Mike Johnson,
|| encryption expert, engineer, software programmer, inventor of
|| the Diamond encryption algorith, and Phil Zimmerman himself,
|| speaking to us about encryption technology, the benefits and
|| uses of recent versions of PGP, and issues surrounding
|| encryption technology.

The RMIUG meetings are held at the NCAR mesa facility in Boulder, CO
at 7pm on the 2nd Tuesday of the month.  To get there, find Table
Mesa (yeah, stupid name) or South Boulder Road, and head West on it
'till you reach the end and find the building Woody Allen rapelled
out of in Sleeper.  The auditorium is just inside the main entrance.
Show up at 6:30 for schmoozing.
