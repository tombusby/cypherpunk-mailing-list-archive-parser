Life can be removed so there must be no rights because I can't imagine
anything more irremovable from me than my own life.

Actually, crypto is nearly that irremovable.  The history of crypto is
of spontaneous invention by human beings whenever they feel their
privacy threatened.

Not anywhere I can think of -- except: there's always my mother's favorite
one liner: "Officer, officer, arrest that man: he's whistling a dirty
song."  Along those lines, I took a massage class once and my boss at the
time was a good, faithful church-going repressed citizen who heard what I
was doing and apparently started fantasizing about the orgies we were
having in massage class, but of course he was too embarrassed to actually
ask me for details.  I suppose my privacy interfered with his right to
peace of mind.

Ah...but private speech can not incite crowds to riot, by definition.
As long as it's private, it can't be "fire" in a crowded theater.
It can't be peddling porno.  It's private while all those other actions
are offensive because they're not private.
