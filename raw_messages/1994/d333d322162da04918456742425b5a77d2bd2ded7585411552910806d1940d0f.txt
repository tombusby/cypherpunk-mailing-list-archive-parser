The crypto code exists, for whatever you may wish to do (at least if it
isn't real-time voice, but that's also being written).  What is now needed
has nothing to do with crypto. It has to do with art, not science, not
mathematics.  Interface design and interface creation, for PGP.  It means
Mac and Windows.  That's a 100+ million user base.  That's why we started
the Mac Crypto Interface Project, and why similar is needed for Windows. 
We already have a simple Apple Script interface almost done (by Pete
Hinely) which will allow MacPGP2.6 to be used by millions, not just a few
fanatics.

"g(x) = O(f(x))" doesn't matter now, no more than E = hv mattered for
getting microwave ovens in every household.  Nice GUI matters now.  The
product exists but it needs packaging and marketing.  I'd like to see a
shift in focus here, brought on not by my nagging, but by realizing how
radical a thing it would be, were a five-minute learning curve, "No
Questions Asked" PGP interface available for the Mac and Windows.  And in
this effort, newbies are the experts, and the leaders, for it is they we
must serve.

It comes down to, do you want strong crypto tools just for your group of a
few hundred, or do you want to change the world?

P.S. ftp to ftp.netcom.com in /pub/mcip to get MCIP.Design.Spec.cpt.hqx to
see pictures of future MacPGP.  There's will also soon be a simple-Simon
interim interface (already almost done) which will use MacPGP2.6/2.6ui as a
dummy crypto engine.  No more 14 buttons and four text areas every time you
want to encrypt the Clipboard.  Also, it looks like AOL and Compuserve etc.
will finally start carrying PGP. That's a mainstream market.  PGP2.6 is a
radical thing, thus.
