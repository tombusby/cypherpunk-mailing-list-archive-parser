YOUR letters, faxes and calls are needed now to ensure that the
cryptography, privacy and security provisions of the Cantwell Export
Administration Act are preserved in bill HR3837 - help strike a blow
against Clipper and for freely distributable software like PGP and RIPEM.
If you can't fax directly, you can send your message to glickman@eff.org. 
EFF will fax or hand-deliver it for you to the Committee Chair, Rep. Dan
Glickman.


Updates on the Fax numbers of the House Intelligence Committee.

 D TX Coleman, Ronald D.       +1 202 225 4831   +1 202 225 4831 
This fax number is also a voice line.  Staff manually switch to fax if they
hear fax tones.  You may wish to call by voice to make sure they do this
if your fax attempts fail.   If you don't get thru, call the Committee, and
ask for the voice number, it may have been changed.

 R CA Dornan, Robert K.        +1 202 225 2965   
Rep. Dornan has disconnected this fax number.  His office does have a fax,
