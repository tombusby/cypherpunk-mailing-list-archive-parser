Greetings.

New remailer: qwerty@netcom.com.

No logs. Only a "counter" that works by appending the word "R" or "ER" to a
text file so I can get an idea if anyone is using it. However, I'm sure the
Netcom and other site's mail logs will be enough to track serious abusers
of anonymity down, without my help. This remailer is dedicated to honest
people who desire PRIVACY.

(The extra "-" and "space" characters at the beginning of some lines are an
artifact of my signing this with PGP).

Accepts standard,
::
Request-Remailing-To: address
(space)
message

or standard,
::
Encrypted:PGP
(blank line)
- -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
Version: 2.3

Blah blah blah.
- -----END PGP MESSAGE-----
(blank line)
Optional message here.

in which the first two lines of the decrypted message contains,
::
Request-Remailing-To: address
(blank line)

Spelling mistakes will land mail in my mail box where I will emotionlessly
delete them. Leaving out the blank lines may cause messages to dissapear.

Public key for Qwerty Remailer <qwerty@netcom.com>,

See the PGP FAQ for how to use encrypted remailers. Send mail to
na38138@anon.penet.fi with subject "Bomb me!" for Gary Edstrom's PGP FAQ
and my "Here's How to MacPGP!" guide.
That's NA (not AN), thirty-eight, one-thirty-eight.

Thanks to Hal Finney for sending me updated perl scripts and a working copy
of UNIX PGP2.3a. I am looking into ViaCrypt UNIX PGP 2.4 as well.

Send mail regarding the remailer to qwerty@netcom.com.
