I meant to reply to this several weeks ago, but was too busy then, so here
are some comments now.

This sounds like an interesting approach.  WEB is Knuth's methodology
for creating self-documenting programming projects.  You run them through
a filter to create the executable code, Perl in this case.  This should
help portability and ease of support.

These mostly sound like great features.  The virtual addresses are something
we have needed for a long time.  The idea of keeping records of which remailers
are responding should help with the use of the network, too.  The one problem
with this is that it might be tempting for the users to just trust the
remailers to choose their chain paths.  It would be much better for the user's
own software to hook up, find out which remailers are operating, then choose
a chain.  Ray's software will allow this, but this function could be split
off from the remailers to a specialized server, perhaps.

I'm not sure about the advantages of remailers signing and encrypting messages
between themselves.  It seems to me that the network should work even without
this.  Ideally we don't want the remailer network to be too centralized and
close-knit.  It's better for them to be strangers to each other since if they
coordinate their efforts they can defeat anonymity.

This was one reason I suggested supporting both old-style CP and the
extropians-style syntax ("::Anon-To").  As Ray suggests, in some cases we
might not have message headers in the RFC822 sense.  I think it is simpler
to think about a message which has remailer commands at the top.

The number of sites which allow users to run socket servers is far smaller
than the number which allow mail filters, so not many people will be able
to use this feature.  OTOH the mail-only sites are generally of low security
and an owned-and-operated system should be able to use this feature.  So it
is definately a plus for those who can use it.

This is a good feature, but it should also be available from non-socket
remailers.  There should probably also be a "Help" command to tell how to
use the remailer.  (A lot of people already have these features.)

Ray had mentioned above that these user handles can also map to encrypted
remailer strings.  This way users don't have to trust any one remailer op-
erator to keep their identity secret.  This need for trust is one reason
I am not enthusiastic about user#remailer1#remailer2#remailer3 as an
address, although it is admirably concise and easy to use.  The problem is
that it exposes the path to the first remailer in the chain.  I really feel
that paths must use nested encryption to be of much value.  Similarly, the
darkmodem#*#*#deepanon requires the user to really trust the first remailer
in the chain.  Perhaps it deserves such trust, but I feel that a system which
does not require such trust would be superior.  (Again, Ray's proposal is
broad enough that it will allow non-trust modes of operation, as I understand
it; my main concern is that these other options are so easy that they will
tempt people to be lazy and slip into modes where they are vulnerable to
unscrupulous remailer operators.)

I am really looking forward to seeing Ray's software.  It sounds like a
good package of functions.
