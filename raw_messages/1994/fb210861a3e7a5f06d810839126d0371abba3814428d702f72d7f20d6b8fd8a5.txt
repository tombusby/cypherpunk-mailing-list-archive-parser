This is one of these problems where there is less there than meets the eye.
First, a distinction is made between Charley's type of certification and
Ingve's: Charley provides absolute assurance and Ingve provides a guess.
But in actuality nearly all certification is probabalistic.  That is,
Charley goes through some sort of process and decides that he takes very
little risk in offering a certificate.	But you can rarely be certain that
anything is true.  So both Charley and Ingve guess.

Secondly, when Ingve makes a similar guess, he takes a quantifiable risk.
If he guesses wrong, he pays a penalty to MS.  You imply that Charley
takes no similar risk.	In fact he must.  The risk may be quite visible
(he posts a bond which he can lose, or the customer may sue for damages)
or it may be less visible (customers will stop coming to him if his
certifications are false).  So Ingve and Charley both face a penalty if
they guess wrong.

Finally, you throw in a payment to MS so that Ingve pays something when
he issues a certificate, but by omission you imply that Charley's
certificates are cost free.  However, if they were, than Ingve's rational
course of action would be to do whatever cost-free mumbo jumbo Charley
does and issue his own certificates.  So Charlie's certification process
must have a cost, and so we suspect that in fact Charlie is sometimes
behaving just like Ingve.  Sometimes Charlie just skips the expensive
precertification steps and issues a certificate anyway, making an extra
profit.  This is a form of self-insurance.  So they are both in the
insurance business.

At this point, the distinctions between Charlie and Ingve have largely
vanished.  Ingve is just a competitor.	MS pays less for Ingve's
certificates because Ingve is known to guess a lot, whereas Charlie is
generally trusted more.  You pay less to Ingve for the same reason.
