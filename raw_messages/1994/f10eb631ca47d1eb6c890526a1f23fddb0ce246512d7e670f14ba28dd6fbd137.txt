Most likely the fact that the RSAREF 2.x licence is a lot more liberal
about commercial use. (read it yourself, but to sum it up it does allow
limited commercial use). 

This means that one can still use RIPEM and TIS/PEM for many 
commercial applications. With PGP one would have to buy a licence 
(presumably from ViaCrypt).

e.g. communications between employees of a company about business 
matters.
