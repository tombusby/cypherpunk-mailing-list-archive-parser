About receiving this mailing list encrypted.... I beleive Hal Finney
is (was?)  offering such a service.  Basically you send in your public
key, and Hal pipes all list mail through pgp and remails it you, from
one of his anonymous remailers.

I don't think many people opt for this :) but the option is there
(unless Hal isn't offering it anymore).

He'll probably answer when he reads the list mail!
