There are the finite automata systems that were developed in China and
have been floating around in privately circulated papers. I have no
idea when these will be "officially" published. The systems in
question are quite exciting because they are far, far faster than RSA.
On the other hand, public key system after public key system has been
broken in the last fifteen years, so I'm not holding my breath.
