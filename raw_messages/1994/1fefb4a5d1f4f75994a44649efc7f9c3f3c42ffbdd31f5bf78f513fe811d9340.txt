If you think you can do a better job *gratis*, I'll be more than happy to
send you a copy of the remailer code that I run on jpunix.com. Also, I'll
bet Raph would send you a copy of the ping code so you can demonstrate the
superior service you can provide. If you really don't think you can
provide a superior service... well... people that live in glass houses...

P.S. If you don't know what gratis means, drop me an email message and 
I'll try to explain it to you.
