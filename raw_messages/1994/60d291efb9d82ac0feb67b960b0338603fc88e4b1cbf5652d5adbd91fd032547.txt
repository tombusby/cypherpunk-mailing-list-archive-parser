OK.  What's to stop this irked employee from simply *taking*
everything?  I just don't see how encryption has any special
significance here.

In either case, the person would probably find themselves in the
middle of some fairly big criminal and civil litigation.

I'm still not sure how it makes it easier.  If you're a programmer,
it's probably easier to insert a trapdoor than to set up some kind of
encryption to take place after the fact.  If you are just hiding data,
taking it is as effective and encrypting it.  Safer, in fact, because
it wouldn't be open for cryptographic attack.

The only real use I could see is getting data out of a company to a
competetor, and if security is lax enough to let encrypted email out,
it's probably lax enough to walk out with a 8mm tape and 5+ GB of
data.
