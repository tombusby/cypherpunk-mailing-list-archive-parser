In my example, p and q a primes.

Which means:
		for all x<p x and p are relative primes
		for all x<q x and q are relative primes

e is a prime as well, and since e<p, e and p are relative primes
e is a prime as well, and since e<q, e and q are relative primes

As for d, your answer is besides the point, since what I was asking is
the _list of possible values for d_. You don't get to choose them. They're
imposed, not free-style.
If some of them are primes, well, cheers.

I'm willing to believe you. Any general formulas giving the probability of
solutions for the d's ? Maybe I'm asking the wrong question. I'll ask again.

What are the properties of those d that unlock ALL messages encrypted by e
What are the properties of those d that unlock a GIVEN message encrypted by e
