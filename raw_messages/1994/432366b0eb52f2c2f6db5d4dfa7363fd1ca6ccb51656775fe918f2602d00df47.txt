This appeared on sci.crypt.research, so many on the list may
have already seen it. For those that haven't (thanks and 
credit to Tim Cole) :



As one reply to the thread on Quantum Cryptography, I have put together
this bibliography of what I could find on the subject about 1 year ago.
If there are other references that are not included here, I, and I suspect
other readers of this group, would be very interested in those references.
Anyway, here is the list:

cryptography, Jnl. of Modern Optics, Vol. 40, No. 1 (Jan. 93),pp 33-6.

Science, Vol.325, 1988, pp. 79-90.

I hope this is a help to those of you just getting started. Many of the articles
have their own bibliographies, but htese were the articles that I could find
in my files. Again, I hope this helps.
