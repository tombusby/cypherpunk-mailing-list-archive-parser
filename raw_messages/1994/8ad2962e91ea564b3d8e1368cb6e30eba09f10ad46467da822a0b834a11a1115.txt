Subject: Update - Congressional Hearings on Clipper and Digital Telephony
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Congressional hearings on the Administration's Clipper/Skipjack initiative,
and the FBI's draft Digital Telephony surveillance bill, and their
implications for privacy and First Amendment rights, are to be held
May 3, 1994.

Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), of the Senate Judiciary's Technology and the Law
Subcommittee, has expressed skepticism of the Clipper encryption scheme,
and has called for hearings to examine the problems of this proposal and its
implementation.  This effort is due in part to all of you who responded to
EFF's grassroots campaign to raise fundamental questions about security and
free speech issues in relation to the White House proposal.

The Senate hearing will be held on May 3, 1994, 9:30am EDT, Hart
Building Rm. 216, and should feature testimony from Trusted Information
Systems' Steve Walker, Whitfield Diffie of Sun Microsystems, Asst. Atty.
Gen. Jo Ann Harris (Justice Dept., Criminal Div.), NSA Director Adm. Mike
McConnell, and Raymond G. Kammer, NIST Dep. Dir.

For more information, contact Senate staffers at the Senate Judiciary
Committee: +1 202 224 3406 (voice), +1 202 224 9516 (fax)
Note: this is the full Committee's fax, so address faxes to "Technology
and the Law Subcommittee" or delivery may be delayed.


Following the Senate Hearings, the House Science, Space and Technology
Subcommittee on Technology, Evironment and Aviation will be holding a
hearing to address related civil liberties issues of both the Clipper
scheme and the FBI "Digital Telephony" proposal, which so far remains
unsponsored. The hearing will be chaired by Rep. Tim Valentine (D-NC), and
is scheduled for May 3, 1994, 1pm EDT, Rayburn Building Rm. 2318.  Witnesses
will include Dep. Dir. Raymond G. Kammer of NIST, NSA's Dr. Clinton Brooks,
representatives from industry in a panel that will include USTA and TIA,
expert witnesses Dr. Dorothy Denning and Dr. David Farber, EFF's Jerry
Berman on behalf of DPSWG, Chmn. Willis Ware of the Congress/NIST System
Security and Privacy Advisory Board, and in a last moment change, the
FBI will be represented after all, by James Kallstrom.

The House hearing is being held "to review the Administration's policies
and legislative proposals dealing with electronic survellance, privacy
and security, ...the adequacy of the Computer Security Act in protecting
goverment computer systems", and "the Administration's proposed Digital
Telephony legislation and decision to promulgate a voluntary federal
encryption standard".

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
