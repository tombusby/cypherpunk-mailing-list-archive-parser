Yup.  All sorts of nifty stuff available for digital ham radio bands,
though if you're looking for a replacement for a SLIP/PPP connection
to the net, you'll probably be disappointed.

Actually, I think it's "obscure the meaning."  My reading of this is
that certain forms/uses of cryptography, like digital signature, would
be permitted.

I don't currently have a TNC to connect up, though I probably will soon.

I don't think I would ever use my connection to do raw IP from my
machine to the Internet, primarily because of the prohibition on
commercial traffic, which is difficult to guard against, and that you
are responsible for your transmittions, regardless of the actual
origin of the traffic.  Makes for a dnagerous combination.

This doesn't protect them.  For example, that C&S spam from a while
ago would have placed any Usenet gateway in violation of FCC rules.
Loss of license, and some hefty fines (though they are usually waived
if you can't afford it or it wasn't malicious)
