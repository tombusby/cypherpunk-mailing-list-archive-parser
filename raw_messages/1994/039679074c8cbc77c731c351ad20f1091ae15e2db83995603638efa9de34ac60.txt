Thanks for your comments Ben. Yes this does suffer from all the
same problems of a classic one time pad. (pad exchange etc)
Obviously Thelma and Louise should have exchanged mutiple pads well
in advance,(and are co-conspirators) and the "pseudorandom pad" E
would be exchanged through an alternate path (intercompany
mail,sneakernet,messenger,etc).

 The part I find fun is that assuming random file B is truly
random, say from an RS232 "crypto-dongle" (if anyone builds them,
count me in!) then ciphertext file C is unbreakable, It dosen't
matter if E is random or not, C is still unbreakable, and using E
to decrypt will only  produce D.

 This was not intended as a cure all, just an interesting
application of cryptography that has interesting effects in the
world of corporate politics as well.

 One small step for cypherpunks.....
