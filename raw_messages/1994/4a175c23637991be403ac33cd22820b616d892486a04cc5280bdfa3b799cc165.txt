As a tax-paying colored person I share Tim's concerns about the
disposition of my tax money by the U.S. government.  My parents, who
are also colored, and many of my colored friends, relatives and
acquaintances also pay taxes.  However, given all of the questionable
governmental expenditures (clipper, et. al) that are usually talked
about, singling out "so-called 'people of color'" seems a bit
peculiar; especially as part of a recruitment drive for a cryptography
list.  Surely, there are more interesting reasons to join the list. 
(And, as we celebrate his birthday this weekend, let's not forget that
Martin Luther King, Jr. was a victim of FBI wiretapping).  HasnUt the
U.S. government done worse than give TimUs money to colored folk?

Just as Tim anxiously awaits the "collapse of the U.S. government,"
many colored people in our fair land once awaited an end to slavery
(a wait that ran around 300 years or more - Patience Tim).  Colored
people have thought about the U.S. government quite a bit over the
years.  

Well...we'll see if strong cryptography is indeed Tim's "underground
railroad" to the "promised land" of anarcho-capitalism.
