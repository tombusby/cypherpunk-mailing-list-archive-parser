This would be a good conference to submit a paper for.  Our own Peter
Honeyman chairs the program committee, and David Chaum is also on the
committee.  All that's needed on Monday is an extended abstract, not a
real paper (yet).

                    USENIX Winter 1995 Technical Conference
                              January 16-20, 1995

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS 

The USENIX Winter 1995 Technical Conference in New Orleans will be the only
broad-theme USENIX conference in 1995.  The emphasis for the USENIX Winter
1995 Conference is on state-of-the-art practice and research in personal,
distributed, and enterprise computing.

We seek original and innovative papers about the architecture and performance
of modern computing systems.  We are especially interested to hear reports on
practical experiences with such systems.  Of particular interest are such
topics as:

*  privacy and cryptography
*  personal digital assistant applications
*  enterprise-scale computing
*  kernelized operating systems
*  user interface toolkits
*  standards-based computing environments
*  file systems and mass storage
*  nomadic and wireless computing
*  shared address spaces

DATE FOR REFEREED PAPER SUBMISSIONS

  Manuscripts or Extended Abstracts Due:              July 18, 1994

  Camera-ready Papers Due:                        November 14, 1994

The USENIX conference, like most conferences and journals, requires that papers
not be submitted simultaneously to more than one conference or publication and
that submitted papers not be previously or subsequently  published elsewhere.
Papers accompanied by so-called "non-disclosure  agreement" forms are not
acceptable and will be returned to the author(s) unread.  All submissions are
held in the highest confidentiality prior to publication in the Proceedings,
both as a matter of policy and in accord with the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976
(Title 17, U.S. Code, Section 102).

where possible, provide detailed performance data to establish that you have a
working implementation and measurement tools.
