Subject: The White House

The White House now has some files available for anonymous FTP & via e-mail.

To get instructions on how to use the service send an e-mail to:

publications@whitehouse.gov

put the words "Send Info" (no quotes) in the body of the e-mail.

You can get transcripts of speeches, etc. Searching on the topic "gay" I
found three entries. All about gays in the military.

BTW, if you want to e-mail Clinton send e-mail to president@whitehouse.gov.

Let's get our foot in his electronic door.

- --------------------------------------------

I know some of the is unrelated, but the fact that the whitehouse has 
stuff available may be relevant.  I haven't used it yet to see what there 
is about clipper and the like.
