I don't know (but I'll make some speculative/engineering guesses), as
I never saw the system...like I said, I heard a verbal description of
it some years back (from Jim Omura, of Cylink, now famous for suing RSADSI).

First, photo-reproduced art is almost never confused with the real
thing. Surface texture, brush strokes, light at different angles, etc.

Second, I could imagine the scanner system using light at two or more
angles specifically to provide better protection against forgeries.

(In the intended main applicaiton, that of detecting machine part
forgeries, the pattern of natural scratches and abrasions, and
grains/regions in the metal, would be essentially impossible to
mechanically reproduce. Not completely impossible, but very difficult,
and hence not cost-effective.)

Anyone interested in pursuing this may be find out if Light Signatures
still exists. Omura may know, and someone at RSADSI probably would
have records of their licensing arrangements.
