I was sympathetic to your argument up to this point. Now I need a polite way
to say "You haven't a clue as to what you're talking about.". These magic,
vest-penetrating, Teflon coated bullets are on of the gun-controllers 
favorite myths. But they don't exist in this reality.

That's not to say the cops don't have a problem. Pretty much any rifle 
will penetrate a standard vest. But then, very few of the druggies in 
real life have rifles.

Reading your last few paragraphs and then you tagline causes a real 
cognitive dissonance. Clipper is intended to make it easier for the 
police to catch criminals, and I have yet to hear a serious argument that 
it won't do that. All of the arguments are that it infringes on the 
legitimate rights of non-criminals.

So here you are, perfectly willing to toss out rights that ARE enumerated 
in the Constitution in the 2nd and 4th Amendments, yet trying to defend a 
much more nebulous "right to privacy"

Since you've so well defended the principle that the individual's rights 
are subordinate to the rights of the "innocent people" to be "safe", what 
rational basis do you have for opposing Clipper?

Sorry, the Constitution isn't a cafeteria. You can't pick and choose the 
rights you like and trash the rest.
