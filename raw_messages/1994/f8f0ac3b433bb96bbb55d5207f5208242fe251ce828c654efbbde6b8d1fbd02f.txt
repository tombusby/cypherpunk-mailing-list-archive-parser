I only have familiarity with the commercial Netmanage Chameleon Winsock
implementation.  Someone else had let me know about this potential 
difficulty.  Apparently some Winsock stacks only provide a WINSOCK.DLL for
3rd party compatibility, i.e., their own applications talk to proprietary
hooks into their stack for performance or other reasons.  Netmanage's products
do both; they perform their network I/O through WINSOCK.DLL, but also use
a variety of shared library functions supplied with the rest of the stack.  In
this case, my WINSOCK.DLL shim works fine.  Remember, I'm not replacing a
given implementation's DLL, just intercepting and passing through calls to
it.  So as long as a mail application uses exclusively standards based
Windows Sockets API calls _to perform network I/O_, my product should work.

YMMV, of course :)
