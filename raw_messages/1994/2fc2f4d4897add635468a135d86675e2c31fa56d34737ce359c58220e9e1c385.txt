I wonder how anonymous this will be once the subpoenas start flying. I
think that this is still traceable via this method:

1) The authorities have you under physical surveillance (A tail)

2) Since they know where you've been they pull the phone records and see
   all of the outgoing calls.

3) They get the records from this company and match the time or the number
   that the call was placed from. (800 billing records have this)

4) Now they know where you called.

You are relying on this unknown company to NOT cave in when subpoenas are
flying around. I wouldn't, especially at 30+ cents a minute.
