It seems that Microsoft is hiring a "Program manager for Electronic Commerce".

I just saw it in misc.jobs.offered:

>Program Manager for Electronic Commerce
>You will lead the design and deployment of a new electronic commerce
>service at Microsoft.  Your experience in cryptography, banking, electronic
>commerce, or communications will be put to use on this project.
>Requirements include at least three years of software development and
>project management experience and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
>or a related field.


Oh Boy.

<tssst>You cannot resist the Dark side of the Force, Luke...<tssst>

Lots of "or"s and not many "and"s in that requirements punchlist though...


Usual apologies to MSerfs,
