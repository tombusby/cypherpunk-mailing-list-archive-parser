In Ohio, they have to give 24 hrs notice before coming in, unless they
smell smoke or gas, or there is some other clear evidence of an emergency
situation.  Not sure about what they can do if they come in because of an
emergency and find you practicing unsafe sex, or something.

I'm not too worried about protection from the state in this case.  That's
what the Bill of Rights is about, and I'm certain these warrantless
searches will fail any Constitutionality test precisely because the
property is government owned.

The scary thing has been our general erosion of a right to privacy from
private enterprise.  For instance, most big companies now routinely make
urinating in a jar a requirement for employment.  It's much easier for a
private entity to get away with something like that than for the government.
