No problem.  I'll try to remember to flame you next time.  :-)

OK.  Perhaps I misread your article.  I appear to have erased it from my
Cypherpunks mailbox, or I'd reread it.  I was reacting primarily to your
initial comments on why you felt it should be on the list.

I don't object to (and am happy to see) discussions of "applied"
cryptography on the list, such as tax laws in the presence of cryptography.
I would only object to the discussion of government in the abscence of
either a (preferably) cryptological reference, or a privacy one.

Yes, and I appreciate you doing so.  I try to work though such postings,
and often check with _Applied Cryptography_ for more background.  But I
usually don't have any response for it.  "Oh, no, that's completely wrong"?
:-)

Such postings are often a stretch for me, with my limited math background,
and this isn't an appropriate place to ask the kind of math questions that
would bring me up to speed.

I agree.  I should apologize then, for misunderstanding your posting.  My
only concern was that the thread was going to start out without any
cryptological reference, and who knows where it could veer from there. :-)
The topics you listed (and I deleted in this response) appear to me to be
perfectly legitimate topics.

I don't disagree with this.  But this takes a skill set I'm still working
to acquire; enough knowledge of cryptological concepts to start a
discussion.

And I don't mean to sound like I'm trying to set the Cypherpunks' agenda.
I know what I would like to see here, and I phrase my responses as such.  I
hope I'm not one of the "complainers and the enforcers of dogma" Eric
Hughes mentioned in his post.
