    Not that easy. They would just crack the code and *another*
    acronym based agency would come up with a different reason to 
    seize you and your computer. It would seem unrelated to anyone
    but *you* since you would know what you did but would have no 
    way to prove that your original infraction is why you are doin'
    time.  Hope that makes some sense.

    Same argument...no one would ever know either way. Until you got 
    out in about 100 years.

    If it isn't something *really good* they probably wouldn't come after
    you anyway.

    #3 I can agree with. I don't think that NSA would tip their hand
    and let on to us that they can read our stuff. At least, not directly.

    One more thing. Don't you think that they subscribe to the Cypherpunk
    list just to see this kind of logic?
    BTW....I ain't one of 'em, and I wouldn't tell if I was.   :)
