    I don't see how using PGPified mailing lists help at all
(with the assumtion that anyone can subscribe). I mean, anyone
can simply subscribe to the list and then read all of the traffic.
What's the point? Anyways...

    I *can*, however, see the use of using PGP encryption for
mailing list submissions, expecially combined with an aliasing
feature. (i.e. the mailing list has a key pair, and people send
mail to it). Possibly even accepting something like the cypherpunk
remailer format (i.e.:

::
anon-post-from: bob

etc... ). This, however, *might* be going to far for some people's
comfort, because it would allow *COMPLETELY* untraceable posts
(depending on the security of the site, but that's another issue).
You can do other remailer-type traffic analysis defeaters like
sending out the posts in random order at fixed intervals, etc.

See above. Also, a couple problems with encrypting it to each person on the list  
is that it takes:

 #1 Space for all of the keys
 #2 Time to encrypt EACH message to each person

Both of which quickly become a problem on high-volume lists such as cypherpunks.
Also, it requires that EVERYONE use PGP if they want to read the list. This, I  
believe, is an unacceptable requirement.
