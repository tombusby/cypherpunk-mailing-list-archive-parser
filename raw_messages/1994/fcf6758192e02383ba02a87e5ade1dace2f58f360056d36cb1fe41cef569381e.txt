COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE AND TECHNOLOGY
U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
2320 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515


                                  March 17, 1994


                                  Special Notice


Because of considerable advance interest in next Tuesday's hearing on
Internet security, we are taking the liberty of including a witness list
for the hearing with this week's calendar mailing.  The hearing will take
place beginning at 9:30 a.m. in 2318 Rayburn on Tuesday, March 22, and will
be chaired by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-VA).

The Subcommittee's interest in the issue arises in part because the
Internet is a prime method of communication between researchers in academia
and industry.  It is also a major means of communication for federal
researchers at agencies under the Subcommittee's jurisdiction.

Recent break-ins on the Internet prompted the federal Computer Emergency
Response Team to issue a special alert to Internet users on February 3, and
suggest that the system may be more vulnerable than generally acknowledged
to deliberate destruction or alteration of computer files.  The hearing
will evaluate the status of security on the Internet today and will
examine measures currently available to enhance security, assess the
effectiveness and degree of implementation of such measures, and identify
obstacles to enhancing Internet security.

A background memo prepared for Members by the Subcommittee is available
from the Committee press office by fax (202/225-8280) or email
(sstpress@hr.house.gov).  Broadcast reporters who plan to attend the
hearing should register with the House Radio and Television Gallery, and
can call the Committee press secretary (202-225-3359) for logistical
information and early access to the hearing room.
