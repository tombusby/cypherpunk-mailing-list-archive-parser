    Then you would have to hope you never do anything illegal. Then 
    no (pick your acronym) agency would be able to easily trump up    
    a charge that could be used as an infiltration technique to get 
    to your system *legally*. If they want to bad enuff I'm sure 
    breaking the law to catch you doing something would be arranged.
    Violating National Interests maybe?

    PGP?...3xDES?....RC5?....plans for an A-Bomb with instructions for
    construction and location of available nuclear material?...pick one.

    Agreed, the problem is finding a way to be sure! A little
    misinformation has a habit of going a long way.

        Be careful...not everyone here is a U.S. resident or citizen.
        At least I don't think so.
        But since I am I know how precariously balanced the definition
        of free specch is. The Supreme Court in cahoots with law
        enforcement and lawmakers could change things pretty quick!
        Throw in a handy list of names......u know the rest.

[I see my smiley was disregarded]

Proof you say!
A classical dilemma:
        If I say I am (one of them) it implies gathering
        intelligence or a reason to sow suspicion even if I am not.
        Denial implies I am what I say I am not.
        So, even though I am not, it would be impossible to *convince*
        you of that. If I was I still couldn't produce *believable*
        evidence to support the statement.
        Take my advice: Don't Trust Nobody.
