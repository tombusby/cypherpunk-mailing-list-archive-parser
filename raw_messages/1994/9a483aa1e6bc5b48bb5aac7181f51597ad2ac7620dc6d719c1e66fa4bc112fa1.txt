Mr. Shostack makes a good point in identifying immunity from traffic
analysis as an advantage of Blaze's subterfuge.  Thank you.  Metzger,
on the other hand, appears to be as stupid as he is brazen.  If only
one party obscures the LEAF field, the needs of law enforcement are
as easily met by inspecting the LEAF transmitted by the other party.
