The idea is to create a unit of currency whose value is convenient for 
typical transactions.  Some amount that is easily grasped by the average 
person.  Originally the US dollar was 1/20th of an ounce of gold.  That 
amount of gold, today, has the buying power of US$18, or so.  A bag of 
groceries more or less.  The amount of gold determines the total value of 
the money supply, but the number of people and transactions in which it 
must take part determines the number and denomination of bills and coins 
to be printed and minted.

No, no, no.  This is a common falacy.  It is the *change* in the amount 
of money in circulation that constitutes inflation or deflation.  If 
there were only one ounce of gold in the whole world, it could easily 
back any amount of economic activity.  Just the ratio of gold to currency 
would change.

There is nothing anymore abstract here than, say, using different systems
of weights to measure your gold.  1 troy oz. = 31.103+ gms.  Just like
saying, "US$1 is defined as 1/20th troy oz. of gold."  Nothing too abstract
about that.

Nothing symbolic about it.  Gold has value because people value it.  Just 
like potato chips and romance novels.

No, the owners own it.  The owners may exchange certificates of ownership 
for other property.

Not being used?  I thought the gold was supporting commerce.

Or other lumps of "stuff."  Property is wealth.  But in the Market Place of 
Ideas, for instance, other "currencies" are paramount, and so it goes.
