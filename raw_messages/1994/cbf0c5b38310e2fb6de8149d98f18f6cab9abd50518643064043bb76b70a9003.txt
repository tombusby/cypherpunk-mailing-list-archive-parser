What P Nave just said about beginning to give cash credit to those who 
receive bogus messages as a dead-letter dropoff point makes sense. If I 
were a subscriber to the dead-letter club, I'd receive a stipend monthly 
by each remailer operator for use of my account as a dead letter office. 

In turn, we could begin using these credits to enact some pay-per-send 
remailers. The remailers with dead-letter club participants would enjoy a 
greater amount of business (perhaps) because of their greater amount of 
traffic -> security through volume.
