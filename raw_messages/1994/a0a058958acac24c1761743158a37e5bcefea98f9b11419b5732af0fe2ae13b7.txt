No, it's strictly digital; any analog circuitry is the responsibility
of the equipment designer, as are details like key exchange.
I assume the motivation for "voice only" are issues like
- Makes Clipper easier to get away with politically
- Avoids stepping on the toes of data standards processes
- Avoids any federal rules about how to make data standards
- Data standards are tougher, since the cyphertext is bigger than
  the plaintext by the length of the Law Enforcement Abuse Field;
  for voice this mainly means it takes a bit longer to start up.

It's still possible to leak data - the LEAF includes a checksum field,
which could easily be leaking part of the key if they wanted it to.
Leaking the chip's master key in 8 pieces would still leave enough
real checksum bits to make sure you were using a real clipper.
