As I said in the original message, the value of fiat money is dependent
on trust in, and the competence of, the government which creates it.
If the government fails or acts up, people (particularly outside the
country which issued the money) stop accepting it, and it loses its
value. In these cases, people usually start bartering and spending
foreign money, like in Russia right now.

And this can be very disruptive to an economy. It creates artificial
limits on the market. Inflation is bad for an economy. There hasn't 
been too much deflation, but it would create problems too. If you
had a lot of money, you might enjoy it, but if you owed a lot, you
wouldn't.

It has an advantage over fiat money - no government to trust. And it
has an advantage over single-standard money - you're not dependent on
the standard. If, theoretically, everything of value is money, then
why not use everything of value as money?

The stock and commodities markets are computational nightmares. How does
trading many different types of coins differ from trading many different
stocks and commodities? The network could eliminate most of these
inefficiencies.

At one time, if you wanted to send someone e-mail, you had to write
it down and take it to Western Union, and pay a specialist to tap out
your message on a telegraph key, and another specialist at the other
end to copy it down and deliver it. Now you can do it yourself, thanks
to better technology. One of the advantages of computers is to allow
you to do yourself, what others used to have to do for you. Bankers
end up with a lot of power, and they often skim off a large cut for
themselves. Their centralization lends itself to government regulation.
If new technology can make them obsolete, and cut out the middleman,
that's good for the rest of us.
