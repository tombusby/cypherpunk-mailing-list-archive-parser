I agree.  I have constructed a parallel port RNG that sampled a blank
AM radio band for its source.  The data lines give plenty of power to
the device, and there are dedicated feedback lines (busy, paper_out, &c).

However, I had a very informative discussion with Eric Hughes at
CF '94 where I learned that this was the wrong way to go to get good
random numbers.  Maybe he would like to comment since I don't
believe I can do justice to his argument.
