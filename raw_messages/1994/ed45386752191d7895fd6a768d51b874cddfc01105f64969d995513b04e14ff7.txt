This goes too far; it's possible/reasonable to only suspect that an action
will cause a certain effect in a useful segment of the target population.
We don't insist on all-or-nothing accuracy in other forms of warfare,
why expect it here?

This doesn't sound like psychological warfare to me - it sounds like some
form of discussion. Psychological warfare is about manipulation and FUD
(fear, uncertainty, doubt). (For all I know, it's about other stuff, 
too. Folks with actual training in the field are welcome to correct me.)

It sounds like your point is "if we're really good and eat our 
vegetables and clean our rooms, maybe Dad will let us stay up late to
watch TV." Well, fuck that. The state is not our parent, and we don't
need to demonstrate good behavior to convince it/them that we deserve
or can be trusted with strong crypto or untapped phones.

No, they do not need our solicitude to bolster their flagging confidence,
they need a good kick in the teeth. I suspect that good behavior will only
convince them that we're up to something *really* evil that they need 
more tools/access to discover.

There is no rational argument that can force the non-trusting to trust.
Attempts to formulate one frequently inspire further mistrust.

So .. to demonstrate that we deserve privacy, we should ask politely
for it? Bad little girls and boys are to get no dessert? Heck, my dog is
smarter than that - she wants to see the treat before she does the trick.
I don't even see the treat here (and am uninterested in letting the state
teach me any new tricks).

Sometimes it's useful to drive opponents into such a frenzy that they're
no loger capable of rational thought; it can be dangerous when the 
frenzied opponent will use the mechanisms of "public safety" to express
its frustration. I agree that this sort of project must be undertaken
with some care - but the point may be to create a state of irrationality,
not a particular rational conclusion. The former is frequently easier and
cheaper to create.

Perhaps this discourse about "images" isn't useful, and it's time to talk
about capabilities. Individuals have the capability to carry on private
conversations whether the state likes it or not. Just as the forces of
"public safety" can and will represent themselves as activists, terrorists,
and saboteurs in order to infiltrate and influence dissident political
groups, members of the public safety forces may be or may become disenchanted
with the current regime or political climate and use inside 
information to embarass or injure the machinery of the state. I don't
think Jeff Davis' action was an attempt at discourse but a shot fired across
the bow of the ship of state. As such, it does indeed serve the purposes
of rational discussion poorly; but it was meant to reach other goals.
