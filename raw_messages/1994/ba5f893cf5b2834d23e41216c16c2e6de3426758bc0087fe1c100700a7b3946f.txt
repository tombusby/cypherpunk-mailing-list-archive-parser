Funny you should ask this.

I had a conversation just yesterday with a relatively new parent who is
really scared about the Internet because it leaves kids exposed to wierdos.

Rather than ask for elimination of anonymity for weirdos, he was asking for
anonymity for the kids -- not just the e-mail address hiding of various
remailers but also an automatic filter on postings to remove (or translate)
names, addresses and phone numbers.


I know of no one who has done anything beyond hiding e-mail addresses but
that software exists, at least.  (I've cc:'ed them here.)

Perhaps some will have thoughts on the rest of the problem.
