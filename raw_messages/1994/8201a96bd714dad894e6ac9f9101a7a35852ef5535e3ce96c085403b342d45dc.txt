O.K., so it's rape.  They're still in bed together.  And I don't 
think I'm going to like the progeny.

Both aspects bother me.  Further empowerment of the FBI bothers me more.

Opposite side of the same coin, I think.  You worry (correctly) that
a politicized intelligence/law enforcement establishment won't be
very good at intelligence/law enforcement.  I worry that it may
become good at something else.

If I keep an image of Washington or Jefferson firmly fixed in mind,
