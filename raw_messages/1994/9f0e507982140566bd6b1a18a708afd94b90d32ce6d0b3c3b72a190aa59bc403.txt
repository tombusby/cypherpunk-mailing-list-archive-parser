It's 1 atmosphere for every 33 feet, but either way, I don't see how
you managed to get 4.5 * the rate. At around 3 atmospheres, you're 

using air at about 4 times the 1 atmosphere rate.

Hmmm. I believe that the diving depth-to-time tables (which I don't have
in front of me. I'll get them out and double check later) give a
time of around 25 minutes. It has nothing to do with how much air you
have. The tables are used to avoid the bends and nitrogen narcosis.
