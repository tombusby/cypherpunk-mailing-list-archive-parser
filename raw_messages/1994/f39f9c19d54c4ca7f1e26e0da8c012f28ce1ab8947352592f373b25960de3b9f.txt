	to anyone, so please don't flame me.  Hopefully the
	members of the list will supply lots of feedback!

	Compression
	- -----------

	   It's probably wise to standardize on a particular
	compression scheme.  I have no opinions on this subject
	and welcome input.  The most important feature is
	speed, not efficiency of compression.

Look, just forget the rest of the bullshit and go away and come
back when you've got good working compression at about 12kbits/sec,
so that you can run it down a v32bis over slip or ppp.  All the
rest of the stuff has been written already (nevot, vat etc)

When you've done that we'll start taking you seriously.

G
PS Oh yes, I foprgot: it has to be done on something less beefy than a
high-speed sparc... any idiot can do that with off the shelf code already.
