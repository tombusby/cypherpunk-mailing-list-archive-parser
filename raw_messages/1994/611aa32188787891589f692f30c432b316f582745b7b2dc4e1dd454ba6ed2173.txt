I use a similar system to Tim's, except that I use NUpop on a "PC" to
download 150+ messages a day from cypherpunks and a bunch of other lists.

We have to move the tools to the user's controlled, secure environment.
For some that may be Unix, but for close to 98% of the 'net community,
a controlled computer is a Mac or PC.  At GMU, a few supported grad students
have personal Suns or other workstations, maybe 50 students out of 22,000.
But nearly all of the students in the techy schools have at least a PC or
mac that is under their personal control. Multi-user Unix solutions
don't cut it.

More importantly, if all 700+ of us on this list used encrpytion for
_every message every day_ it would be only an insignificant portion of the
net volume. We have to get encryption out to the masses.
