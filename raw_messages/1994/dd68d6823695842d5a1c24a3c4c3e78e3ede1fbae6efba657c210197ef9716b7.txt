    (Technically, cryptography is MAKING codes while cryptanalysis is 
    BREAKING them.  Both are subsumed under cryptology.  A CIPHER is 
    a regular transposition such as A=Z, B=Y, etc., while a CODE is a 
    table of arbitrary symbols.)
    Kahn, David, THE CODEBREAKERS, MacMillan, 1967.  The MOST 
      complete history with specific examples.  Written before public 
      keys, RSA, etc., but still THE place to start.
