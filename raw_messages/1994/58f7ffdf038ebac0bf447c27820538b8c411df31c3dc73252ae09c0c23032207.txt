Dear Cypherpunks-

A friend mailed the following questions, which I have edited.
Please Cc: any replies to me for now as I'm getting back on cypherpunks after
the digest was shut down.

Note: A.S.U. is Arizona State University, in Tempe (next to Phoenix).

Quite a few people answered (thank you all) my earlier question by saying that
doing your own encryption is the best solution.  True in a way, but I know
there are "student rights" groups that specifically work to intimidate
college computer administrations into modifying these sorts of policies,
also setting up standard privacy policies, etc.  Is there some other mailing
list or newsgroup where I would find them?
