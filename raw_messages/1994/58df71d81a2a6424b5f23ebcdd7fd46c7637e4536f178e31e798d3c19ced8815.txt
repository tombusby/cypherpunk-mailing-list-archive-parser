Hey, maybe its just me, but when I saw "Steve Dempsey"s first
mail to cypherpunks come time ago where he represented himself
as Lance`s postmaster, I thought "funny, this guy writes just
like Detweiler when Detweiler is acting sane..."

So Dempsey has now said that he`s chopped LD`s account...Hmmm...
How come this was posted today?

I also notice while you were all wondering where LD could still
be getting his cypherpunks feed from, Dempsey had become a subscriber to
the list.  (You guys really should block that EXPN command you know...it`s
been mentioned often enough...)
