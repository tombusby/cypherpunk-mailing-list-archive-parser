I've asked them to say something. The best I could get out of Paul
Dineissen is that they're talking with banks. Well, duh. The _present_
reality is that I can sell things ** and get paid ** if I use First
Virtual, but not if I use ecash.

Why clear big aggregate sums? Why not just clear smaller ones? Hell,
why not use a forwarding engine that just says "this cash came from
bank X" and sends it along?

I'm sure that the design of a robust, usable system is nontrivial, and
I don't mean to imply that it is. I just don't believe that a tool the
size of Fedwire and the existing bank architectures are, or will be, required.
