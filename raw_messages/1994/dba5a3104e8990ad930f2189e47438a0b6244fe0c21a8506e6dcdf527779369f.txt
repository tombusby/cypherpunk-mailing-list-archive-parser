    Maybe, but the state has a wonderful scam of paying off a "5 million
    dollar jackpot" over 20 years; the true value (what the same deal
    would cost you to buy as an annuity) is less than $5 M, possibly much
    less. If private outfits did this, they'd be jailed.

Yes, but the return is still 50%.

                  ^^^^^^^
    "Or even"? The numbers games almost always have much better odds than
    the State pays...that's one reason for their popularity (another is
    tax avoidance).

I've never played the numbers game myself, but I've heard that the
payoff is 600-to-1 on a 1000-to-1 bet.  That's a 60% payout, compared
to the lottery's 50%, hardly "much" better.  Compare to casino games;
Keno, 80%; Slots, 90%+; Roulette, 95%; Craps, 99%.

    Oh, I see you mentioned this scam. (Calculation should still be
    simple, as any spreadsheet can handle discounted present values and
    the like.)

Not simple for me.  If it's simple for you (or anyone reading this) I
would be interested in the results of the calculation.  Recall "x" is
either the number of times the jackpot must be passed or the nominal
value of the grand prize for which there is a positive return for the
player (assume no prize split).  You might work this out for time
values of money of 5-10-15% per annum.

    I've never played, and never plan to. Money down the drain.

I rarely play (have never won).  My wife (an ethnic Chinese) plays
weekly in a "pool" where she works.  She plays on her own when she
sees a good "omen", like finding dog shit in front of her house(!?).
