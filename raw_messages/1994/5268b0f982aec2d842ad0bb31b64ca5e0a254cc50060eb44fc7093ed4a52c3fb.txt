With a pseudonym, all a signature really says is that this is the key that
always goes with the posts signed by this nym.  Assuming there has not been
more than one key claiming to be the "real" nym, then after a while there
can be no doubt that the key and nym go together (which is all that was to
be proved). Personally, I sign nyms that have existed consistently for some
time. I have never distributed any of these signed keys, but see no harm in
doing so as long as the key's user-id field clearly indicates that the key
is a nym and not a person. A sig on a key by a notable like Tim May would
help keep new users from getting taken in my some interloper claiming to be
Pr0duct Cypher.

If I am trying to maintain a truly anonymous pseudonym, I am hardly likely
to allow to connect my key with an email address. All a sig on a
pseudonym's key means, is that is the key which signs posts from that nym,
not such a hard thing to demonstrate with enough empirical evidence.

P.S. I can be reached privately by leaving a message in
alt.anonymous.messages with my name in the subject line.
