I was _just_ speaking with a few technicians at various FAX management software  
vendors.  A couple of them were saying that identifying the return telephone  
number on incomings FAXes is highly problematic.  There are no established  
standards regarding the format or presentation of the return FAX number  
information.  Also, some older FAX machines may or may not have the feature at  
all.

I wonder, however, because it seems to me that whenever I've received FAXes in  
the past (not exactly commonplace) they have always had the return FAX number  
somewhere at the top of the page.
