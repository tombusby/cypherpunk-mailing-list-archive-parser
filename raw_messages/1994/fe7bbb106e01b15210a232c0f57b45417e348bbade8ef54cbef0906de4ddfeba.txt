I spoke to Phil Zimmermann again today, and as per his request I have
removed the hack of 2.6ui from ftp given that PGP is Phil's intellectual
property and I respect him. In its place I have ftp'd Mathew's 2.6ui, I 
recommend it to all of you who want upward and downward compatibility
with official versions of the software.

Ever forward,

David

PS, I know that an 8176 bit key is absurd from a security standpoint,
for that matter so might a 4096 bit key, but there are users who feel 
they need such a capability and for their sake I sincerely hope that a 
future version of PGP addresses this concern at least up to 4096 bits. :-)
