- ->:My humble opinion: Jim is not really the enemy, nor is he really a
- ->:friend. He is a businessman trying to make a buck via the intellectual
- ->:property laws.  Sometimes this works out in our favor, sometimes it
- ->:doesn't. He sends out letters defending his intellectual property
- ->:rights that tend to be full of innuendo and that border on
- ->:prevarication, but always stay on the proper side of the line; this is
- ->:such a standard practice among people in businesses like his that I
- ->:can't fault him for it. Overall, I'd say that anger towards him is
- ->:misplaced.

Unfortunately Herr Bizdos is not dealing with the business community, he is
dealing with the INTERNET community. While all the sabre rattling may be
acceptable within the business community, it is not acceptable within the
INTERNET community. In effect Bizdos created his own problem. If the code
was stolen, he should have had better physical security on it. If a
licensee anonymously posted it, he should have included a means of tracing
the code back to the source of the leak, then pursue that individual, not
the whole INTERNET crypto community. If the code was reverse engineered,
that's one of the risks in not patenting it. Personally I'm tiring of the
whole affair.
