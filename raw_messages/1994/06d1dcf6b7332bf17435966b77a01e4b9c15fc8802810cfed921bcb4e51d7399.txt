The IGP files are available at a32.cc.umist.ac.uk in the /network/ftp/igp 
directory.

There are two versions of the program available:

1. igp8_10x.zip for 8 bit sound (on 8 or 16 bit sound cards)
2. ig16_10x.zip for 16 bit sound cards.  Better quality, but more data
   to transfer so a bit slower.

the latest source code is also available as igps_10x.zip.
