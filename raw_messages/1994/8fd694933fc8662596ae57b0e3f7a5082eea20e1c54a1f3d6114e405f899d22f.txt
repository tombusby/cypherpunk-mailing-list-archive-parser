I still have AT&T as a long distance carrier.  I have contacted the
marketing guys for the clipper phone repeatedly, it doesn't seem to be
doing to well, they are desparate for sales leads.  This is a subsidiary
called AT&T Surety Communications, base in North Carolina.  One has to
wonder how much damage you can do to them by boycotting AT&T long distance.

It would be much more interesting to provide more cost effective competition.
One of the TSD-3600c costs $1050, plush the phone interface module.  This is
more than the $947 for a videophone!  There may be a niche market in modifying
clipper phones to cure the LEAF information leak as well.

The single oddest thing about the announcement, was that they were talking
about spending the equivalent of $25K for each new phone subscriber in Saudi
Arabia, and still only doubling the number of phone subscribers.  Where the
heck does all that money go?
