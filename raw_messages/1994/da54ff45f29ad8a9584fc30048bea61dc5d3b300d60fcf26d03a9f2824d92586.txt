Not a good time for me, I'm afraid.  I'm on the radio at that hour every
Saturday (and I don't get back to the city till 3 or so).  Actually, I'm
missing my show that day anyway because I'm going away for the weekend.
Would it be possible to do it some Sunday instead (though not the 9th, of
course), or a weeknight?  If not, I'll catch the next meeting, I guess
(unless it's on a Saturday afternoon).

Would Sunday the 16th be OK for this meeting, or do folks not want to wait
that long?

P.S.: My apartment would also be available for future meetings if it's needed.
