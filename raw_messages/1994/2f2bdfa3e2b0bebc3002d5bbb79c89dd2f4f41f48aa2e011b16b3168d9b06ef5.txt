I think this is an interesting approach. I think there is a degree of 
linkability that is hard to shake, especially in the early, low
bandwidth days (and in the later, high-bandwidth days, the CPU
will get exercised in proportion to the extent the messages are
unlinkable.)

My thoughts on this continue to be in favor of distributing random
number "tokens" to your correspondents; your sniffer has all your 
unused but issued tokens and scans for them. I do like your approach 
for "initial contact", but the keyid size would need to be finely 
tuned.  It is also not clear if you want the sender to be able to 
set the keyid size, as this gives them the ability to create more 
work for you.

The downside to my approach is that it would require some support
from remailers and in the sniffers (has anyone written such a 
beast yet?), and a small, very simple program for generating 
packets of the tokens, accepting them, using them, and exporting
them to the sniffer.

Your approach could probably be implemented by the last remailer 
prior to news posting and a change to PGP. Frankly, I would like
to see a PGP encryption option that had no visible key id and 
decrypted based on a decryption key id specified on the command 
line. (But this has been suggested many times.)

All grist for the mill...
