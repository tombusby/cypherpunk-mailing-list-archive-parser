It's not so strange.  Cypherpunks are trying to bring about social changes,
not primarily technological ones.  Crypto is here, and we want to change
our culture in a way where, through strong crypto, privacy becomes the norm
rather than the exception.

With this goal in mind, public-key systems are vastly more interesting
because they are the `social' solutions.
