I want to make a crossbreed between NCSA's httpd 1.1- which already
supports passing PGP signed/encrypted messages between client and
server- and Magic Money.

The result: a pay-to-view information service. It is uncertain about
when I'll get around to it, since my free time is already being spent
working on the Mac version of Nautilus. If anyone's interested, or if
any of our protocolmeisters (yes, that's you, Eric & Hal!) have ideas,
bring 'em on.
