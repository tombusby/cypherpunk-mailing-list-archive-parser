That is a good idea, creating a special USENET group for coded messages.
Alt.security.coded.messages would be a good moniker.

Personally, I am not familar with gopherholes or message havens, so I do not
know how good they are, and can log telnets in.  It is harder to log nntp
reads of alt.security.coded.messages or such.  If an admin is very nosy, they
could be snooping your terminal and packets as well, though...

Another idea could be an anonymous FTP site, but someone can go and delete
all the messages on there, and ftps are logged as well...

Any better ideas on being able to anon-post and anon-read with as few
ways for a third party to log as possible?

(This is for my curiosity only, as I rarely have anything worth saying that
needs this much protection.)
