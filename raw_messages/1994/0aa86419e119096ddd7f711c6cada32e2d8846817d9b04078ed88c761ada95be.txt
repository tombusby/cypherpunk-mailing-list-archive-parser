Subject: Leahy to hold hearings on Clipper Chip!


Dear Friends on the Electronic Frontier:

I have some good news to share with you.  Senator Leahy just sent me a
letter indicating that he *will* be scheduling hearings on the
Administration's Clipper Chip proposal.  I would like to thank all of you
who sent us messages to forward to him urging hearings.  I'm sure that
stack of messages we printed out made a significant impact on the Senator
-- the stack was over seven inches tall!  (We look forward to the day when
no trees will have to be sacrificed in the furtherance of democracy!)

And if you haven't written a message to Rep. Cantwell yet about her
proposed amendment to the Export Control Act, please do so and forward it
to cantwell@eff.org.  This is an address we set up to enable us to collect
messages in support of her bill.  We have been printing out messages and
delivering them each week -- so far we've received over 4500 letters of
support.  For more information on the Cantwell bill, send a message to
cantwell-info@eff.org.

Thanks again.  We'll let you know as soon as the Clipper hearing gets scheduled.

Sincerely,

Jerry Berman
EFF Executive Director

Dear Jerry,

Thank you for forwarding to me the many thoughtful and informative messages
you received over the Internet regarding the Administration's recent
approval of an escrowed encryption standard, known as the Clipper Chip.

Many of the messages urge Congress to hold hearings to review the
Administration's Clipper Chip standard.  In fact, I intend to hold a
hearing before the Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology and the Law, which
I chair, to consider the important issues raised by the Clipper Chip.  I
will let you know when a date for the hearing is scheduled.

Thank you again.

Sincerely,

/s/ PATRICK J. LEAHY
United States Senator
