  It may or may not be a critical distinction...  Do you consider a check 
to be "money"?  Or is it exchangable for money?  Does a wire transfer 
count as money, or is it simply a transfer of funds from one account to 
another?

  I don't see CypherBucks as true money.  It to me is a secure means of 
transferring cash from one account to another.  If you see a chech as 
money, I am pretty sure you won't agree with me.

  A check in itself is almost useless until rendered to a bank.  It is 
not legal tender.  You can't use a third party check at the store.  You 
can only deposit (transfer funds) or cash it (exchange for legal 
tender).  CypherBucks will probably go the same way.  If you issue me a 
transfer token, I won't be able to pass it off to Sandy since she won't 
be able to validate it's value, only the CypherBank will; so there will 
be no third party CypherBucks.  This brings it a little farther from 
legal tender.

  Of course, this is just my $ 0.01  It's too early on a saturday to put 
in a full 2 cents!
