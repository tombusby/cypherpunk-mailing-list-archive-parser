It's not exactly a children's book, but may be classified as a 
"juvenile" novel and is the young peoples' room in the berkeley public
library. but I read it as a 
5th grader, and it made a deep impression on me: _The Currents of Space_
by Isaac Asimov. A small subplot in it concerns setting of alarms by 
requesting a library book on a forbidden subject. 

Another book that has probably  interested many young people 
in privacy tech is the Zim book on codes and secret writing.
I read it in grade school, and I seem to recall reading that Diffe 
did too.
