Q3.  Other Services:

  1. Miron Cuperman's anonymous pool.

     To subscribe, send mail to pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com.

     Mail sent to pool0@extropia.wimsey.com will be sent to all
     subscribers of the anonymous pool.

  2. Matt Ghio's pseudo-account remailer.

     Send mail to mg5n+getid@andrew.cmu.edu

     You will receive an encrypted mail address of the form
       mg5n+eaxxxxx@andrew.cmu.edu

     Mail sent to this address will be forwarded to you.

  3. Jay Prime Positive's mail pool
    
     Send mail to jpp=0x123456@markv.com, and the mail will be
     encrypted with the key matching 0x123456, and sent to alt.test
     with a subject line of "Ignore 0x123456"

     To add a key, send to jpp=poolnew@markv.com.  The body of the
     message should contain the public key in pgp format.  If there is
     a key clash, a message with the subject "Ignore jpp=poolnew key
     already in use"
