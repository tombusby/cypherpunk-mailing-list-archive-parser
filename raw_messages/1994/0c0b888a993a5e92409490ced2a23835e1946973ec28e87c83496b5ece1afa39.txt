2.0 to 2.3a were developed outside the US, released in New Zealand and the
Netherlands, and _imported_ into the US. While a version of 2.3a in India, say,
need not have come from the US, and hence does not indicate an ITAR violation
somewhere, the version of 2.6 in Italian sites got there only because they were
illegally exported from the US.
