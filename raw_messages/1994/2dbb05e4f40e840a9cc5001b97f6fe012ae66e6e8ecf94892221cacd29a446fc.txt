    Curve Encrypt 1.0, IDEA encryption for the Macintosh is now
    available for ftp from ripem.msu.edu, directory:  ...

    Distribution:

    Curve Encrypt (c)1994 Curve Software.  Permission granted for
    distribution within the United States only.

    It's fine with me if you make the software available by giving it
    to your friends, putting it on _local_ BBS's, taping floppies to
    stalls in the men's room, things like that.  But don't export the
    software, and don't make it available on places like international
    anonymous ftp sites.  And please make sure that the people you
    give the software to understand the export restrictions.  This
    applies the application and the source and anything that
    _contains_ Curve Software copyrighted source.

    Is this sufficiently clear to keep me from getting Swanked?

You need have no concern about Swank himself since he is not
interested in Macintosh software.

It should protect you from being "Swanked" (thank you for making a
verb out of my name; a rare honor) by others -if- you independently
wrote all the code.  But if you copied, for example, the IDEA code
from a copylefted product like PGP or SecureDrive then the copyleft
applies to your entire product; at least that's my understanding.
