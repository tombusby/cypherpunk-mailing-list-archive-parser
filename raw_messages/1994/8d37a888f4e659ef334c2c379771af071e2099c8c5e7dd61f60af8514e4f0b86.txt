I agree.

This is of course much closer to the ideal way of doing things.  However,
the original motivation for this project was that in order for all
existing Winsock based mail agents (except for Zmail, it looks like now)
to add crypto/anonymity to their functionality, some work has to be done
to change them.  The system I came up with to spoof Winsock would be
(hopefully!) transparent, in that it would work with _existing_ mailers
_today_.  To go the route you outlined, while in the long run a much more
sensible way of doing things, would require the same sort of effort on the
part of the current mail agents, i.e., they would need to change.

Your suggestion is one I would like to follow up on; in the mean time, I am
going to make an attempt at the spoofing idea.

Hehe.  It's the user interface I hate doing the most!

Nah.  Variable bit sized binary records work well enough :)
