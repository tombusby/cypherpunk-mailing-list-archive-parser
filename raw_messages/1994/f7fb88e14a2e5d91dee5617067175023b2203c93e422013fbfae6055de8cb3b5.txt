Yes, it's often easy to identify a single piece of the overall dynamic
and use it to account for everything that happens.  I'm only saying
that legal guarantees are not necessarily the last word about what the
government can and can't do to you.  Chomsky's optimism (as you know)
doesn't stem so much from a faith that our legal system will one day
start working properly, as from a faith that people are capable of
evolving - an outlook that you and I seem to share, but that many on
this list don't.
