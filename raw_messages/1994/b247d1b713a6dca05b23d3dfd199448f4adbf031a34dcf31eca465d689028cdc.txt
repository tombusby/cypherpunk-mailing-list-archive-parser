I only disagree in the most trivial sense with this point. If you
weren't required to re-establish your excludes every time they expired,
it might not be such a hassle.

A secondary concern is that some net users do not have very much disk
space available in their account, and would rather not have stuff come
in in the first place.

Once again, I find that if I set up my mailer to delete every C-punk
message except the ones from Tim May, Sandy Sandfort, and Duncan
Frissell, I get by just fine. They end up quoting people enough that
I don't have a problem keeping track of threads. And I'm reasonably
sure I haven't missed anything I might be interested in.
