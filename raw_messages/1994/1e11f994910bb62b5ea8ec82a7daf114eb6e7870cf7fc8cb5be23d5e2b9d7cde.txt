As a veteran of a mere two weeks+ as a subscriber, I doubt
that I have sufficient experience to form much in the way of
conclusions re behavior here.  I'm inclined to agree with
your "major conclusion."

All of this discussion of unsubscribing has made me curious
about the "turnover" rate here.  I saw the stats posted a
week or so ago on current subscribers.  I am wondering if
there are figures available, or if someone could give me a
ballpark sense of how many subscriptions vs. unsubsrciptions
there are in an "average" week or month.  I would also be
interested in getting an idea of how long the "average"
subscriber has been subscribed.

Now...back to lurking.
