Be sure to include the requested size and color, as well as an e-mail 
address for confirmation of the order, and a snail-mail address to send 
the shirt to.  Students: be sure you include an address you will be at 
after May 14.

I must recieve your order by Wed., April 27.  It is possible that there 
will be extra shirts avaiable to people after this date, or a second 
printing run for late orders, but I can only guarentee shirts to orders 
recieved by this day.  Assuming all goes well, I will have the shirts in 
the mail by Sat., May 14.

Thanks to all who have offered suggestions while I was refining the 
design, and for all the un-expected interest.

A reminder: The shirt is available for viewing at

This is accesable by Mosaic or Lynx.  Lynx will download gifs of the 
design to your own disk.

It will be available soon via anonymous ftp.  I will post the address 
when that is confirmed.

Thanks again,
-john.
