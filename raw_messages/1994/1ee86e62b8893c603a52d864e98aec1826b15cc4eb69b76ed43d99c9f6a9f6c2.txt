How is new technology transforming the economy?  How will it alter the 
fundamental qualities of economic life?

We don't have all the answers.  But we do have a powerful new way to look at 
the the revolutionary changes brought about by the emergence of the Information 
Age.  And, we have leading edge thinkers and doers from a remarkable variety of 
disciplines -- high-technology, biology, economics, public policy, business and 
more -- who share the powerful idea that the economy is an ecosystem.

That's right:  the economy is _not_ some giant machine.  It's like a 
rainforest.  A virtual rainforest where coded information, like DNA, defies 
entropy.   Where organizations (like organisms) cooperate, compete and evolve 
in a complex, self-organizing process that is not only unplanned, but 
unplan-able. (Sounds like the Internet, doesn't it.)

And, now, we have a discussion group:  evolve@bionomics.org.

As well as an occasional newsletter:   just.the.facts@bionomics.org.

JOINING -- send to info@bionomics.org with "SUBSCRIBE Evolve" or "SUBSCRIBE 
Just.the.facts" in the subject line.  Participants in "Evolve" will get 
"just.the.facts" automatically.

CONTRIBUTING -- send to evolve@bionomics.org.  This is an archived, 
quasi-moderated discussion. Signal-to-noise will be kept high.

VANISHING -- send "unsubscribe" or any questions to info@bionomics.org or to 
our domain postmaster, klacobie@bionomics.org.

This message comes to you because either we read this list or people keep 
telling it's right up our alley.  Now we want you to come explore the truths 
and consequences of the infoweb with us.  And bring your friends. (If you don't 
have any friends, you're probably spending too much time reading email.)

You made it this far... hit <reply> and take a lurk.  Become a part of the 
bionomic community, where high-technology and the free-market converge.

Steve Gibson
