I agree, and made exactly this point at today's Cypherpunks meeting,
during Raph Levien's talk on his "premail" work. (Note: Colin Plumb
was also there, amongst others.)

I expect to be switching to Netscape, or something similar, and a
SLIP/PPP connection. So I'm all in favor of integrating things. 

And I agree that "Network" (Microsoft is preparing copyright
infringement suits against all those also using the term they invented
last week) will account for the majority of Net connections soon.
Being built into Windows 95 will ensure this.
