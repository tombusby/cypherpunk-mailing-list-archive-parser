Todd...

| The cypherpunks@hks.net service is now available.
| 
| It will sign any message sent to cypherpunks@hks.net with its (currently
| 384 bit) key and forward the signed message to cypherpunks@toad.com.

Does this look right?

| I welcome any suggestions on the format of the message and the prepended
| message.

Why not stealth it and just appear as if the sender signed it?


| I've made a couple of changes to the format of outgoing messages that
| should hopefully make life easier for readers.

Thanks, Todd!

  
| The most noticable will be the movement of the blurb, but also very
| significant is the removal of the "Reply-To: " (feh on the proliferation
| of MUA behaviors) header, and way down on the "noticable" list is an
| "Errors-To: " and a "Sender: " header.

Lookin' good.
  

| Thanks for y'all's comments: keep 'em coming.

Good work.
