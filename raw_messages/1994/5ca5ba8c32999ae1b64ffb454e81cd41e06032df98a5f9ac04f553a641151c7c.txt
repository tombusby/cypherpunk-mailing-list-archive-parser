Okay, first I'll go over the case where delay without dummies does NOT
reorder.  Then I'll go over the case where delay simply adds needless,
well, delay.  Then I'll talk about the cost of dummy messages.

Assumption: Your remailer assigns each message a number from 0 to 59 and 
            remails it at that minute of the hour.  Whether it's hours in 
            the day, minutes in the hour or seconds in the minute only 
            changes which of the following two cases is more likely:

Case 1: The remailer receives no messages for 61 minutes, then one message,
        then no messages for 61 minutes.
Result: In the hour following receipt of that one message, only one 
        message is sent.  Guess which message it was.

Case 2: 60 messages arrive in one minute.
Result: The last one(s) go out about an hour later.  They could have
        all been sent in the next minute with equivalent reordering.
        P.s., if 60 messages arrive *every* minute, under the assumption
        above, you have to save an average of 3600 messages.

So, with this method, you can adjust the delay time down to guarantee
delivery time, or up to make reordering *more likely*, but you can't
guarantee reordering.  If you want 1/N reordering to be likely, you need 
to set the response time to N times the inter-arrival time for the 
*quietest* traffic periods.

To guarantee reordering you have to either wait indefinitely for enough
messages, or after a while insert some of your own.  To get over the
problem of needless delay, you either need to invent some kind of 
tricky variable-delay scheme, or turn your attention away from clock 
time and focus on ordering.

Say the worst turnaround you want is 24 hours, and you want to get 1-out-
of-10 reordering.  Then on a day where you receive only one message (for 
this you got a SLIP connection?) you would need to generate 9 dummies.
Assuming 10Kbyte messages, the bandwidth required is... 10.4 baud.

For a turnaround of 2.4 hours ... 104 baud.
                   15 minutes ... 1040 baud.

And remember, you generate only enough dummies to keep up the minimum
*total* traffic, so in reasonable-traffic periods, you generate no
dummies and the amount of real traffic you can handle isn't affected.

I guess this sentence, which you quote, wasn't clear:

In other words, in a world of communicating forwarders, a dummy message
from one just looks like regular traffic to any others it goes through,
and serves to keep their traffic levels up--the more remailers the
fewer dummy messages each remailer has to generate.

Traffic analysis is difficult when the order of messages is sufficiently
scrambled.  If you don't reorder, then delay doesn't help.  If you do
reorder, then added delay doesn't help.  Whether one message is
"synchronized" or not with a random other message isn't useful 
information to an outsider.

How might this information help analyze traffic?

Also, as I mentioned, if you send your dummies to yourself indirectly,
then pretty soon the level of input will match the level of output,
and the ratio of bogus to real messages *won't* be visible.

As far as I can see, dummy messages are simply necessary if you want to
guarantee both reordering and response time.  Please explain if you
believe differently.

Are you  charged per byte or just a flat rate?
