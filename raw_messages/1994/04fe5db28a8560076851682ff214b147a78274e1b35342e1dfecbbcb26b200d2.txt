Revisionist history!

CRT's were 80 columns because Hollerith cards were 80 columns. They had
been that size since the late 1800s.

70s compilers for Fortran and Cobol used the columns. Cobol had
A and B margins, Fortran had sequence numbers in columns 1 thru 6, and the
continuation column in 7. The compilers weren't changed just because
of a new fangled I/O device.

In the good old days, there were only two I/O sizes that counted,
80 and 132.
