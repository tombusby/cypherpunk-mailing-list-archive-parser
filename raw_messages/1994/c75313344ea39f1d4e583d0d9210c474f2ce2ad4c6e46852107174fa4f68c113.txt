Well, it wasn't me, but in any event I dispute this.  The use of anonymous
remailers does not make one a coward, any more than the use of a pseudonym
does (or is your given name "Lefty")?

As for the privacy aspect, I believe it may serve the interests of those
who desire privacy to point out privacy lapses.  Not all the time, but
sometimes you have to say, "the emperor has no clothes".

For example, would you object to this:

an4544@anon.penet.fi  = Eric Robison <ericr@Solbourne.com>
an68863@anon.penet.fi = Derek M. Harkins <harkinsd@solix.fiu.edu>                 *
an51751@anon.penet.fi = Joe Baptista <baptista@planet.org>

The anonymous remailer is not so anonymous, is it?  Should I have kept
the information to myself, or am I right to publicize it?
