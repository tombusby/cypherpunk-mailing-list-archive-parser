I sent a slightly less polished version of this to Perry, and then
realized he'd cc'ed Cypherpunks.. but it was gone by then...

You are of course correct. I should have chosen the example of
encryption, where you can't preenhance.

Yes. Conveniently, we've anticipated this requirement. The
content type of an SHTTP message can be set to indicate that the
enhanced content is actually an enhanced document rather than
an enhanced HTTP request/reply. So, you just cons up some
headers and drop in the presigned page...

But this is a very good point. I'm glad I'm not the only person
who thinks this is an important requirement.

Details on this can be found in the current SHTTP spec (Section 2.3.3)
