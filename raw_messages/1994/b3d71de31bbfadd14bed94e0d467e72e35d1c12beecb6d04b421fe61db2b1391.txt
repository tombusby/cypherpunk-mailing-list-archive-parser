...drivel removed...

In the Received: header, fulton.seas.Virginia.EDU identifies the message as
coming from nym@netcom14.netcom.com

My question is, How did it do this???  Did it use identd?  I tried making a
fake mail thru that site and it did not show my username...but neither kaiwan
nor andrew have identd installed.  nova.unix.portal.com did the same thing:

>Received: from <netcom12.netcom.com> (nym@netcom2.netcom.com [192.100.81.108])

Comments?
