Recently received an offer from Hilgraeve, producer of HyperAccess
for Windows 2.0. (800) 826-2760

I quote the brochure "Enjoy easier, safer, more secure file transfers
with amazing Hyperprotocol enhancements: Autostart, Smart Crash Recovery,
and RSA Encryption"

"Exchange files containing sensitive data through public data channels
(local phone lines, long distance carriers, cellular, or wireless) with
complete confidence, using state-of-the-art RSA encryption."

Any comments on what they are up to?

This is the same company who sent my
friend the previous version of the package and told her fer sure fer sure
it had full 3270 emulation, but turned out to be a VT100 session with some
keyboard remapping to simulate PFkeys. She had to call them twice for her 60
day guaranteed refund.
