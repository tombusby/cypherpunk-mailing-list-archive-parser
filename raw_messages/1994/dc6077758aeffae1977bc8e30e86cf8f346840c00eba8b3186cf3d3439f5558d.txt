I am not sure I see why you think that the "cherries" will line up.
If one has the two honest remailers in the chain, then the only information
the TLA has is that you sent a message, and the other person received one of
the N messages in the labyrinth. N is the number of messages sent which could
have been the received message (this is proportional to the number of messages
in being reordered). It all depends on how big N is. Given the current traffic
load, I suspect you are correct.
