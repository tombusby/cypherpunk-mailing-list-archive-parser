Isn't this what "alt.anonymous.messages" is all about?

(It's been at my Netcom site for many months now...I don't recall who
created it, but it seems to me it was one of us.)

Miron Cuperman ran a message pool for a while....I don't know the
current status.

Other options exist, but all are lightly-trafficked. When more users
are using them, expect more such places.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. More remailers are always a good
thing, and offshore sites are especially good, but I'm not sure what
you mean by your last point.
