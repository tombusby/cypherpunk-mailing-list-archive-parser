Hm... I have a request:

(There was a security incident here at Rice; owlnet has been
disconnected from internet for about 2 weeks and I think quite of bit
of mail has spilled.  Email has supposedly been restored, but that's
it so far, and given the number of "fork: no more processes" errors
I'm getting I think it'll be a bit longer...)

Can anybody send me the original "Remailer Noise Traffic" or "REMAIL:
Noise Cover" messages?  I'd like to read them and include them at the
gopher site (when I can actually telnet/ftp over there :-).  I only
have 20 messages from the list since the 23rd.

Thanks!
