To this can be added an obvious fourth possibility:

        d) know and care, but have a paycheck to earn and a career
           to think about.

I think many people working for companies developing unsavory products
find reasonse not to quit in rigtheous indignation.

In fact, we could add more possibilities:

         e) know and care, but think it best to "work from within"
 
         f) know and care, but also know that company will just assign
            others to same job

And so forth.

The may also know and care, but think the dangers are being
overstated, or that "that's not my department" ("says Klaus! von
Bomb"?)
