Hi Phil,

How about S.P.I.T.

                     S ecure
                     P hone
                     I mplementation or interphase
                     T erminal or technology

Then you could S.P.I.T. on the government as they tried to listen to your
conversations or S.P.I.T. on your employer as they tried to monitor your
phone usage. Or you could S.P.I.T. in the wind if you have no one to call.
;)

More names will probably follow.

Sam
