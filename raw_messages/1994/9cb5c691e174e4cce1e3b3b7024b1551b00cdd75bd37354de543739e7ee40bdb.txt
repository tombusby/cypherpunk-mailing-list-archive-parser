/ | It is my understanding that folk outside the USA can legally run
/PGP | versions from 2.0 to 2.3a, but cannot legally run Viacrypt
/2.4 or the | RSAREF-based version 2.5, because they contain code

I think if cryptography is illegal it does't mater a FUCK what
version the program is. Insure against the inevetable by
distributing to the DUMM FUCK CLUELESS COMPUTER USERS THAT ARE NOT
AS FUCKIN' COOL AS YOU ARE. Power to the people/power in the people
