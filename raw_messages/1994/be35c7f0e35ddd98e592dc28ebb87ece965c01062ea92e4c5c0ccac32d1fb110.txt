Yes, perhaps.

By any means necessary includes by means legally suspect, but not
explicitly forbidden.

In a public forum, this was probably the goal.  In general it is not.
Perry, I suspect, has too much to lose to be caught exporting.
To suggest that the point was to find a legal solution is to dodge the
basic question.  The point is to get the stuff out.  Finding a legal
solution is one method.  Don't lose sight of the end.  The end is still
in many ways, revolutionary.  Cypherpunks, from all I can tell, is partly
the political movement to empower the individual at the expense of the
state.  The fact that the state has the upper hand for the moment only
varies method, not intent.

So even the exportation of crypto "technically" compliant is dangerous.
It could merely trigger more drastic measures.  Instead, the focus
is or should be on getting the genie out of the bottle for good, so that
even extreme measures yield nothing.

In so far as the law is a matter of perspective, I think everyone should
try to embrace the concepts of the law, and in particular, the constitution.

Just because our contemporaries have lost sight, or made (drastic) 
departures, doesn't mean the document, or the doctrine, is useless.
