  An astonishing bit of Internet provincial fuckheadedness, I must say!

Well, you're at least 1/3 right! (:}

   Uu> first (or only) leg of a remailer chain.  It is also the only

  That remail@extropia.wimsey.com is in Canada specifically makes
  communications with it fair game for NSA interception, however.

Good luck, NSA. Better warm up those Crays. Wimsey is also the
only remailer to -require- the entire incoming msg to be encrypted
with a strong PGP key

  pub  1024/B5A32F 1992/12/13  Remailer <remail@extropia.wimsey.com>

Note this feature doesn't allow the encrypted SASE supported by other
Cypherpunks remailers which -allow- encryption but remail any
unencrypted text following the encrypted portion (which often includes
the auto sig, our original topic).  Instead, wimsey supports a pool
address:

   pool0@extropia.wimsey.com

which is essentially a mailing list devoted to broadcasting to its
list of subscribers anything mailed to it. You join the mailing list
by sending a request to

   pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com

Typically reply mail would be encrypted to a pseudonymous key you sent
via the conventional forward remiler method, so although everyone
on the list would receive the message, only the intended recipient
could read it.  Note that even if the authorities learn you are on the
mailing list, you have absolute deniability that you are the intended
recipient of any particular message.  (But keep the pseudonymous
secret key encrypted when not in use).
