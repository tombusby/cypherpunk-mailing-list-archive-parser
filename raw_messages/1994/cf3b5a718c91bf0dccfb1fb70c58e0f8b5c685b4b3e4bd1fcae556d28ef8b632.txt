What complete and utter garbage.  With monthly access costs in the $20 
range and an incredibly diverse marketplace under construction without 
"public interest" power-mad fascists involved in it, such whining shows 
nothing more than their view of the gullibility of the public.  

All networking proposals involve two-way networks and private voice and 
data systems that anyone who cares to can use to communicate with anyone 
who cares to.

Any "public interest group" that cares to (and many have) can put aside 
its tin cup and get online.  If 12-year-olds can do it...

"Whether or not the residents of that fetid swamp between Virginia and 
Maryland try to help us or hinder us, we'll build Market Earth on the 
nets.  And there's not a damned thing on God's good green earth that they 
can do about it."
