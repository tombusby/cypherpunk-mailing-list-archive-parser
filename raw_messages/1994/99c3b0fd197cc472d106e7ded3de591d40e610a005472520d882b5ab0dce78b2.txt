The following is the notice for the IEEE P1363 working group.  The
official title includes RSA and Diffie-Hellman, but these two
algorithms are on hold because of patent issues.  The committee is
going forward on elliptic curve systems.

Here's how this committee works.  The working group is composed of
individuals, not representatives of companies.  Anybody can show up
and participate.  The voting rules are as follows.  If you've shown up
at two of the last three meetings, you can vote.  That's it.

The next meeting is typically set at the current one.  The meetings
are held in conjunction with various security conferences, typically,
to make it easier for everyone to attend.  The last two meetings were
at CRYPTO in mid August in Santa Barbara, CA and at the Fairfax, VA
security conference in early November.  The next one will be possibly
at the Oakland, CA conference held in May at the Claremont Hotel.

I'd urge all interested parties to make an effort to attend.

Eric
