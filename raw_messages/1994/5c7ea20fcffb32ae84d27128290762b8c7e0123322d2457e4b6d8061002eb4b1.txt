Some friends of ours tried starting up a regional group of a system
called LETS, which works on this principle.  The group members traded
`spots' for services or items - in this case generally stuff like
gardening/handyman work, computer programming, whatever their skills
were. The spots were tallied in each member's account with a community
`bank'.

The key to the whole thing was that there is no value in the currency
itself, only in the *exchange*. It never really got far enough off the
ground to become self sustaining, due to lack of interest or general
apathy, but was an interesting idea.

Apparently there are a number of communities in the US with this kind
of system established, as well as other kinds of barter economies.

One of the interesting features of such an alternative economy,
especially when when it operates side-by-side with a traditional one
where debtors could leave the system, is that there is a strong
community incentive to prevent anyone building up either too large a
debt or too great wealth. In both cases such a person becomes a risk
and a burden. But there is never any problem of someone keeping money
out of circulation, or being short of small change.

In the LETS system I mentioned above, everyone's current balance and
trading volume were published in a newsletter. That way, community
members were encouraged to keep their balances, and those of their
trading partners, near zero.

This is the same situation as now. However, consider that you don't
actually *need* anyone to lend you money -- you can make as much as
you like yourself by contributing to the community, or borrow some
from the community at any time.

Sure.. lots of people are doing those things you mention.. in fact I'm
sure I've seen you do *all* of them yourself, Russ :)
