This debate brings together two nationally prominent experts in this
area.  You won't want to miss the verbal fireworks and the
opportunity to learn more about this important question.

Background
==========

The Clinton Administration is promoting use of the Clipper Chip
technology that provides encryption, but in a form that law
enforcement can unscramble. It also backs legislation requiring
design of digital communications networks so ongoing surveillance
will be feasible.

Law enforcement officials argue that these proposals are necessary
to protect society from criminals and preserve important
investigative tools.

Privacy advocates contend that these proposals grant broad new
powers to law enforcement agencies and diminish protection for
future users of the National Information Infrastructure.
Sponsored by the Stanford Law and Technology Policy Center and the
Stanford Law and Technology Association.
