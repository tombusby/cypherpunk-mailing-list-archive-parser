Here is a program I found in the usenet archives which will do some of the
splitting and merging features.  Note that the merge is smart in that you
just cat the pieces together and process them.  The main feature of the prog
is that you can reconstruct even with a few missing pieces, necessary because
of the unreliability of remailer email.  I don't think the splitting is
cryptographically strong, but each piece could be separately encrypted if
desired.
