I assume you mean embedded binary (under radix 64).  In Unix land,
uudecode could be assumed or a script version of radix decoding
could run against itself.

You are quite correct in assumption of platform.  This is a bummer.
The ubiquity of DOS makes this a bother rather than a block.  (I'll
bet even you at least _see_ a DOS box occasionally!  :)

"Ida, remember our last conversation....  who were we talking
about?  (Please provide full name properly capitalized.)"
"Ida, you and I were reading the newspaper in the break room the
other day.  We discussed a point of mutual interest.  What was it?"

The less intimately I know the recipient, the tougher it is to
formulate a good question.

I agree, moderately secure.

Yes.  :(
