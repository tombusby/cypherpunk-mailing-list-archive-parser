I communicated with Jim Bidzos about this, asking him what he'd heard
about the Karlsruhe/Walker-Belenson proposal--he said he'd gotten no
wind of it, thinking it to be just another academic paper. Later
messages indicated he was taking it more seriously.

As to RSADSI's objections or approvals, I can't say. They are a
_company_, planning to (someday??) turn a profit for their investors
(Note: Alan Alcorn, the inventor of "Pong," invested in them in the
early or mid-80s, and says he's not seen a dime come back, nor has the
company gone public). That is, RSADSI is not run along Cypherpunkesque
lines, but you all knew that.

My understanding is that the Walker-Belenson algorithm is quite strong
as it is. I tried to ftp to ftp.tis.com, and succeeded, but could not
find the Karlruhe paper(s) there, yet. If someone knows where they are
(Carl?) or otherwise gets ahold of them, they might be useful
additions to our own archives. Or a pointer, at least.

I think 95% of the opposition to Clipper came from two sources:

1. General opposition to the principle of "escrowed encryption"

2. Disinterest/opposition to the idea of buying special hardware.

I don't see the "Skipjack is weak" argument as ever having been
persuasive. Hence, I don't see the following as too big a concern:

What scares me is the incorporation of the SKE or GAK into products.
Not that RSA may offer an even stronger system.

It's the principle.
