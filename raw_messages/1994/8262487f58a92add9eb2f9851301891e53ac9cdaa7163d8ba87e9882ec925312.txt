  I think that I am confused.  Please bear with me.

  Now, what is this SASE?  Apparently it is either a) a fully-specified
  return-path (presumably a chain of anonymous ids at various remailers),
  b) a next-hop address (anonymousid at the next remailer that "knows"
  where to send the message), or c) some combination of the previous two.

  Is there another possibility that I have missed?

  Let's assume that the SASE is of type-a.
  
  Let's assume three remailers (and my accounts on them) named:

  anon1+@foo.bar.edu
  anon2+@biff.bam.com
  anon3+@fred.barney.org
  
  Then, if I want to anonymously send mail to you ( <hfinney@shell.protal.com> )
  , I need to specifiy your address as normal, but specifiy some optional 
  header (X-Anonymous-Sender-Path) like this:

  <anon3+"anon2+"anon1+@foo.bar.edu"@biff.bam.com"@fred.barney.org> 
  
  which says to my mailer that, while the ultimate destination is 
  <hfinney@shell.portal.com>, it should first mail it to the 
  X-Anonymous-Sender-Path address.

  HOST: fred.barney.org  Account: anon3+

  This anon3+@fred.barney.org account will accept the mail (it accepts anything
  like anon3+*@fred.barney.org, so it doesn't matter about the stuff in quotes)
  It then strips off the anon3+@fred.barney.org section, and re-writes the
  X-Anonymous-Sender-Path to read like this:

  <anon2+"anon1+@foo.bar.edu"@biff.bam.com>

  It would then instantiate another optional header (X-Anonymous-Return-Path)
  like this:

  <anon3+@fred.barney.org>

  It would change the Sender: header to say "Anonymous User 3" or whatever 
  it would normally say, and mail it to biff.bam.com.

  HOST: biff.bam.com  Account: anon2+

  This account accepts the mail and re-writes the headers like this:

  X-A-S-P: <anon1+@foo.bar.edu>

  X-A-R-P: <anon2+"anon3+@fred.barney.org"@biff.bam.com>

  Sender: "Anonymous User 2"@biff.bam.com

  and mails the mail to anon1+@foo.bar.edu

  HOST: foo.bar.edu  Account: anon1+

  This account accepts the mail and re-writes the headers like this:

  X-A-R-P: <anon1+"anon2+"anon3+@fred.barney.org"@biff.bam.com"@foo.bar.edu>

  Sender: "Anonymous User 1"@foo.bar.edu

  Notice that it leaves off the X-Anonymous-Sender-Path: header since it is
  empty.

  It then mails it to hfinney@shell.portal.com.

  You receive the mail and read the message.  Now, the sender indicates that
  it is from "Anonymous User 1"@foo.bar.edu, but the X-A-R-P: indicates that
  it is really from anon3+@fred.barney.org!  So, as long as fred.barney.org
  can be trusted, no one can tell who I am, right?  And, except for anon3,
  none of the others needs to be my account!  This requires changing the
  mail agent on my end, though, and possibly yours.

  Replying follows the same sort of path, except in reverse.

  Of course, you could also allow for a Return-Path header which was not
  re-writeable, to force a seperate path to get back to me.  And, you can
  also change the software so that I initially send to 
  hfinney%shell.portal.com@fred.barney.org, which would *not* require any
  rewriting of mail-agent software.

  Is this at all coherent?

  If the return-path is type B, I don't see how you can avoid having the
  ID-mapping which makes the overall scheme weaker.  I don't have a good
  handle of the type c.

  Hmm... I'm not sure I followed all of the math, but how's this for
  a signature?
