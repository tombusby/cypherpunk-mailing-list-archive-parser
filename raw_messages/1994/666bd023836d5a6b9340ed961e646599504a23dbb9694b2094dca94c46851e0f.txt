I think it's time - messages to Pr0duct Cypher (sp?) have begun to appear
on C-punks and on at least one of the Usenet groups; I think it's time
for alt.crypto-traffic, or alt.W.A.S.T.E (from Pynchon's _The Crying of
Lot 49_ - I think it was Tim May who first suggested alt.W.A.S.T.E).

I found a nice Perl script to scan a news spool (or a subset thereof) for
arbitrary text strings. It could easily be modified to send its output to
mail; so one wouldn't even need to subscribe to the group to rcv messages,
if correspondents would be so obliging as to mention the intended target
of the message (which, of course, would create a security risk and
facilitate traffic analysis; security or convenience, choose only one.)
