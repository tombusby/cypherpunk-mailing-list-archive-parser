For a long time I've wanted to set up a remailer that instead of just 
re-mailing the input mail would telnet to port 25 on a specified machine 
and spoof the headers exactly like you tell it to, or that would anon-ftp 
upload the "mail" message to a specified site, or that would continualy 
check a local (or remote) ftp directory for filenames that match a 
certain wildcard, processing them as inbound mail... I can think of a 
couple of situations under which having a mailer pick up off a newsgroup 
would be very usefull... send a pgp encrypted, nested message through a 
chain of four remailers... one is a standard-ish remailer which peels off 
the first layer of encryption and posts your message to a certain 
newsgroup. The second one, whos address remains a mystery, spoofs or 
remails the message it found in the newsgroup to a different newsgroup, 
where it is again picked up and decrypted by the third remailer, which 
uploads it to an ftp site watched by the fourth, again anonymous 
remailer, who picks it up and remails it to the recipient. It may all be 
an excercise in futility, I'm not an expert on that kinda thing, but it 
sure /seems/ more secure to me...

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
