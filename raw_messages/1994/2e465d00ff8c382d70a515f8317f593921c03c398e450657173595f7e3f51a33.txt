The anon remailer at ideath.goldenbear.com will likely be available
only erratically over the next few days; after the move it will be
co-located at a site featuring a 56K frame relay connection, so
reliability should be good after that. I don't anticipate losing any
traffic, but mail will be travelling via dialup UUCP not TCP/IP until
the move is complete and the DNS data is updated.
