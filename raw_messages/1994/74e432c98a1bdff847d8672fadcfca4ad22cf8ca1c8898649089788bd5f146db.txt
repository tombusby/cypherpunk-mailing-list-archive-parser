While I agree with this, there is another, more practical reason to use
cryptography for everyday, non-sensitive material.  This may seem trivial
to some.

The more we are in the practice and *habit* of using cryptography for both
privacy and authentication, the more *prepared* we are when we unexpectedly 
find ourselves in situations that *require* cryptography.

YMMV.
