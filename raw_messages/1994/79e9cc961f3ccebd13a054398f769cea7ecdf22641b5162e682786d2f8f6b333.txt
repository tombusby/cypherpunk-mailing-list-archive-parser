While I don't see how the two technologies are mutually exclusive, you may
have a point about anonymity. But WWW/Mosaic's acceptance of e-cash may
make it more attractive (don't know how just yet, but I bet it has to do
with liquidity), with or without anonymity.

While only increasing the velocity of the air around here with my all my
hand-waving, I expect that the service charges would be justified with
increased liquidity of e-cash, I believe that the increased liquidity comes
from not having to balance a bunch of customer accounts at the end of the
day, either at the issuer of the cash, or the vendor who received the cash.
When a retailer goes to the bank with checks, each check is specifically
identified.  When the check bounces (a straw man in an electronic market),
it has to be collected.  When a customer reneges on a credit card
transaction, it has to be traced back to the retailer.  That doesn't happen
in e-cash.  I expect someone's said all this here before, and I beg the
cypher.gods indulgence...

I think that the credibility of the issuer is important to the security of
e-cash. That security is upheld with cryptography and Chaum's technology.
I think that privacy is a by-product of a very liquid and efficient funds
transfer system. All the byproducts of the reduced paperwork.  So, I think
I got the chicken and the egg mixed up. Point taken.

True.  But Tim(?) had a point back there when he talked about them having
to work around Chaum.  I also think that something important did happen on
imp-interest. Most of the pertinent discussion delt with the need to put
something up and test it out.  I didn't *see* anything in that vein until I
heard here about Tacky-Tokens and Magic Money.  But as Perry aptly pointed
out, Unless you denominate them in *real* money, you're just trading
baseball cards (or coke cans).  It ain't real until the financial system
plays. TT and MM are important, because they address the operational
issues.  They're where the rubber meets the road. They aren't the engine,
however. That's a true player in the financial system (a bank or bank-like
entity), and the people who have the technology: Digicash

I hope he goes after the banks, central and otherwise, and lets the
mercantile protocol sort itself out in the market.  When I started reading
about you folks, I ran into an article in one of Stuart Brand's
publications (The Whole Earth Review?).  It talked about the "fax effect".
That is, one fax machine is worthless, but millions are very valuable.  I
think this is what the whole PGP idea was about.  In this case, if the
ability to spend and receive money was cheap (or free) the franchise to
print money would be very dear indeed.  I think Chaum understands this. I
hope he does, anyway.
