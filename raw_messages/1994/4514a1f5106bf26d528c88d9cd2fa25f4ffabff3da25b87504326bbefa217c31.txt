But Tommy ... if we did that, we wouldn't be able to read *YOUR* 
posts, either.  Perhaps anyone who had a fetish for 
"ease-of-use", or was troubled by even seeing "cryptographically 
INcorrect" ideas (the analog of "politically correct") would tire 
of Cypherpunks altogether and just read the party line from 
Sternlight and Co. (tm). <g>

The other problem is that if some brave, anonymous soul wanted 
to, let's say, "leak" the Clipper algorithm to the net, he'd have 
to forge e-mail from one of the "approved sources" above to gain 
an audience.

However, despite your anonymity, Tommy, don't I see your tongue 
firmly implanted in your cheek?  I sure hope so...  I find the 
posts from the "approved three" individuals highly informative.  
OTOH, if *THEY* did as you suggested, traffic would be 
drastically reduced because it would only consist of those three 
talking amongst themselves.
