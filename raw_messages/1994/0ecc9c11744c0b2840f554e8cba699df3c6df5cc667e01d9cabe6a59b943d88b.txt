This happens to me all the time. I quite often see duplicate postings,
too, although the multiple-posting copies of the same message eg
the Chaum ecash announcement was a different problem, possibly 
caused by the same delay problem - re-posters haven't yet seen the
first copy.

>I'm especially interested to hear from Netcom sites.

Can't help you there, except provide evidence that it is not a
local netcom problem. Not to say netcom doesn't have local problems...

I am at the end of the world here, at least the corner of North
America. Think of me as your East Coast Sentinel - I can see Signal
Hill from here if I go outside, and I can see Cape Spear from there.
On Signal Hill there actually is one of those posts with arrows 
pointing to New York, London, Moscow, etc, with all the mileage.
(Maybe I should invent East Coast Sentinal as a pseudonym.) There
are two lines into here for Internet traffic, and perhaps soon to
be others, but except for that, we are the end of the line. Might
make traffic analysis a problem someday.
