	The specs I have say SoundBlaster, which I assume means just 
standard 8-bit SoundBlaster minimum, with 16-bit ASP or WaveBlaster not 
necessary or supported (at least at first...). All will become clear when 
Nautilus 0.2 is released, as VoicePGP will use that as its code base. The 
Mac version will just use the built-in sound hardware.
	The 486DX2 will be more than sufficient. Initially, the specs 
called for a 486 chip at least, but the Nautilus developer (forgot his 
name... Bill someone) said that a 386/33Mhz would be sufficient.
