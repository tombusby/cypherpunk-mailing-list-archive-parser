OOPS. This is a spec ommission. The clear key data (aka "salt") is
combined with the secret portion as follows:

	The bytes of the salt are concatenated with the secret
	portion with the secret portion making up the least significant
	bytes of the concatenation.

I will spec'ize the english...

By the way, where did this 40% number come from? For some reason RSA
never told me this... :^(
