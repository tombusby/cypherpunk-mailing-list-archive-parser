> Women's shelters have for per-line blocking.  (A matter of life and death

> But the Order dismisses all of these problems, and determines that the

> profit a bit more by selling our numbers and if the direct marketers have
> less trouble gathering them.
> 
> The FCC doesn't seem to trust consumers to be able to decide whether they
> want per-line blocking.  It praises the $40 cost of an automatic *67 dialer
> as an appropriate disincentive that will benefit the nation by discouraging
> people's choice of per-line blocking.

> There was one part of the order I was pretty happy about, until I read it.
> The FCC has also banned the sale of numbers gathered by 800-900 number
> subscribers using the ANI system, unless they obtain verbal consent.  (Note
> that no rules prevent sale of numbers from the presumably blockable CNID
> system.)  The problem is that the only enforcement of the rule seems to be
> that the requirement must be included in the fine print of the ANI sale
> contract between the common-carrier and the ANI subscriber.  So it seems to
> be up to the common-carrier to enforce a rule which is contrary to their
> financial interest.  How can a person who suffers from publication or sale
> of their number recover compensation?

> The FCC is soliciting comments, due May 18th
> in their Further Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking on two issues:
> 
> o       Whether the Commission should prescribe more precise educational
> 	requirements.
> o	Whether and how the policies adopted on caller ID should be extended to
> 	other identification services, such as caller party name or CPNI.

>     the same number may be used to telephone other law enforcement

>     calls, calling number privacy is not needed and calling number
>     identification can actually be a valuable piece of information
>     for both the caller and called parties.  The record reflects the
>     useful nature of CPN based services, and the comments of
>     Rochester illustrate that callers are likely to be interested in
>     blocking only a small percentage of their calls.  The comments of
>     USCG illustrate the usefulness of caller ID to emergency
>     services.  In contrast, Missouri Counsel's analogy to unlisted
>     numbers is inapposite because caller ID only permits parties
>     called by the calling party to capture the calling party number,
>     and then only if the calling party has not activated a per call
>     blocking mechanism.  We find that the availability of per call
>     unblocking does not cure the ill effects of per line blocking.

>     Moreover, in an emergency, a caller is not likely to remember to
