The Competitive Enterprise Institute is pleased to announce:

		THE VIRTUAL HAND

		CEI'S FREE-MARKET GUIDE TO THE
		INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY

Now, under one cover (over 50 pages!), all the Internet places of interest
to free-marketeers.  Do you want to find the complete electronic text of
"The Wealth of Nations"?  How many places can *you* list where you can
discuss the words of Ayn Rand?  (The Virtual Hand can name five.) Do you
want to know the latest in conservative or libertarian politics, or would
you rather sit around griping about gun control? 

All this -- and more! -- is available from the Competitive Enterprise 
Institute.
