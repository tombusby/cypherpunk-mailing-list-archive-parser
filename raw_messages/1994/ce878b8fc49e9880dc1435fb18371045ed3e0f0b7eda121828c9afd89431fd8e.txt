It surprised _me_ that you put this on the list - magazines usually don't care
to announce their future stories so much in advance, but this is a little 
review and cypherpunks are noted for their discretion ;-) so I guess it's ok.

As far as the "usefulness" of info on "advanced stuff", and the "questions it 
will generate" - awareness is all about arousing curiousity. It will be a Good 
Thing if people who keep reading about the nuclear terrorists and pedophiles 
can come and see for themselves what _really_ goes on on the list. Of course 
the membership may soar for a while before declining again, but _some_ new 
useful people are bound to join.

If he does a good job, then it would be nice. A web is really the best way to
browse through so much inter-related info.

Come on. Responsible sysadmins regularly mirror updates - from the thousands of
PGP sites to the dozens who download 6 mb of movie databases each week. Every
one does not get in sync as soon as the new release is out, but these things
usually don't take more than a week.

Scott Loftesness (76703.407@compuserve.com), the primary SysOp of CompuServe's 
Telecom and Internet Forums says he'll have the Cyphernomicon in both forums:
TELECOM FORUM (GO TELECOM)
LIBRARY: NETWORK SECURITY (LIB 6)
FILENAME: CYPFAQ.ZIP

INTERNET FORUM (GO INETFORUM)
LIBRARY: RESOURCES-TECHNICAL (LIB 15)
FILENAME: CYPFAQ.ZIP

Worst comes to worst, WIRED can put it up in their forums at AOL etc.
