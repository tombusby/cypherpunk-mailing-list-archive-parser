I have recently come into possesion of a VAX account which I would like 
to run a remailer thru. I have gotten a variety of code from soda which 
I have little comprehension of. Does hal's instructions contain instructions
in ASCII? Mine don't seem to. Other remailers seem to only work on UNIX  
machines. Our VAX has VMAIL and, I guess, VMSMAIL. If someone could tell me
if it is possible to run a remailer out of a VAX account (no root) and steer 
me toward some code that has instructions on how to set it up, it would be 
nice. I am a bit clueless on this so some tutoring might be needed. I do 
have access to various compilers. Please respond by private mail, if I can 
get this going I'll let you all know.
