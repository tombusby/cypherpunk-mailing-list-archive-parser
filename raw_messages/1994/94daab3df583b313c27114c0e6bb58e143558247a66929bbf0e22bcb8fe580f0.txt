The preceding remailer message path was generated using Hal's Chain utility. 
One can find this program at soda.berkeley.edu pub/cypherpunks/remailer, get 
Chain.zip. It automates alot of the drudge in chaining remailers. It will 
even encode messages using PGP if you have the remailers public key on your 
ring and your PGP directory in your path statement. For instance, to get the 
above remailer path I typed the following:

chain vaccinia@uncvx1.oit.unc.edu vox rperkins nowhere <foo.let> foo.vox

Thus my address will be the final destination, the message file (foo.let) 
is converted to the remail ready file, foo.vox. The remail ready file must 
then be manually sent to the first remailer in the chain, in this case 
remail@vox.hacktic.nl. It will then go to rperkins@nyx.cs.du.edu and then to
nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu, finally being sent to vaccinia@uncvx1.oit.unc.edu. 
The Chain.ini file (from the chain.zip file) contains the remailer addresses 
and whether a PGP public key for the remailer is available on your public key 
ring. Remailers for which you have keys will automatically be encoded and 
begin thusly:

::
Encrypted: PGP

N.B., It may be neccesary to edit the chain.ini file (it is merely an ASCII 
file) to update the list of remailers. I recommend this utility for chaining
to most remailers. Remember that remailer@soda.berkeley.edu does not support 
the format,     ::
                Request-Remailing-To:

Even so it is a handy program to have if you want to avail yourself of the 
cypherpunks remailer system.
