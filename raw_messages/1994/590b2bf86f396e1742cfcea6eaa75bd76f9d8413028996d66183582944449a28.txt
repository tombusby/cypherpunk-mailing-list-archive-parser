Ok, I'm new to this crypto bit so I probably will have more mistakes here than
correct answers.  Anyways I'm going to give a shot.

1)If you have the secure channel(sneakernet) that you have to re-init each time
you use th eone time pad, then this will be most likely a novelty, since Lousie
could have slipped Thelma the plaintext when she slipped her the pad.

2)If you're using a pad like this, if I'm not mistaken isn't this what Kahn
calls a 'book cipher' where it would be simpler to crack than a true one time
pad that is truly random.

3)Thelma could have used stenographic technology to send the same information,
she could have used faxes that when decoded could yield a message(kinda like
the old punch cards)

Anyways, this is just the view of a complete rank amateur.  Give me feedback
y'all.
