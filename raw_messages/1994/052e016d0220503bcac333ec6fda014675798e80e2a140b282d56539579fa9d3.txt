Lead article in the Science and Technology section of this week's
Economist is about Clipper.

As usual for the Economist, it is really quite good.  Good description
of the LEAF and Blaze's hack.  Mentions the 47,000 CPSR signatures,
Wired, and makes a good case for how a "voluntary" standard might not
be, and the export issues.  Wish all general-interest publications
were so well done.

The profile of Clipper is rising, and the press is not too shiny for
the NSA.

P.S.  In the middle of the page is a great line-drawing of a
evil-looking cloaked spy in hat and dark glasses, poised with a dagger
and skeleton key at a key-hole equipped computer.  Wish I had a
high-res scanner, Postscript-ized those with fast RIPs could get it in
its full copyright-breaking glory.
