This letter that John Gilmore has forwarded to us provides a vignette
into why not just seditious plotters and other tentacles need crypto:

Wanna bet that such a group forced to use "Clipper," "Capstone,"
"Tessera," and other approved crypto tools would have their
communciations opened and read by various "interested" agencies?

* attorney-client privilege in an era of networked offices will be
broken unless strong crypto is available (ditto for
psychiatrist-patient contacts, sensitive medical records, etc.)

* groups that have contacts outside the U.S. (as in the case Brock
Meeks reports on) have always evoked the interest of the CIA and other
agencies...without strong crypto, their communcations will be even
more easily accessible if Digital Telephony II passes.

Most of you understand these points, but it bears repeating that
individuals and groups from many political points of view will be
affected by the "transparent society" of Clipper, Capstone, Tessera,
and Digital Telephony.
