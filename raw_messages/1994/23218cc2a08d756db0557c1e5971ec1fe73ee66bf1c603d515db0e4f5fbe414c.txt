someone writes:
$ an anon-http proxy server would probably consume much more in 
$ the way of network resources than a remailer, which will  
$ likely lead to many being shutdown once discovered by the sysadmins  

That might be somewhat less true on a commercial provider than on an 
educational or corporate provider, but in any case a WWW anon-server would be
seen as a much larger potential security hole than a remailer. A couple of
months ago a "friendly" outsider gained unauthorized access to user files
here via our Web server, and reported it to the sysadmins. I would have been
mighty nervous if I'd been offering anon WWW access to the world.
