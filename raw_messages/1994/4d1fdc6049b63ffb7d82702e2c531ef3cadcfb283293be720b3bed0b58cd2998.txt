That may be so. However, I agree with Tim that I don't think society
is equiped to make decisions on when a child should be taken from
parents simply because they have odd views. Unless a child is being
physically tortured I am not sure that mechanisms can be designed that
will not, for the most part, be abused and used largely to attack
non-conformists, of which I am one.

I see no reason to attempt to distinguish the cases. I know parents
that do not provide their children with television sets -- perhaps the
new-fangled crime of "information deprivation" would be used to attack
them. I know of Amish families, and I have no interest in tearing
children away from them, either. Leave people alone, I say.

I'm an extremist in this regard -- I believe all children "own"
themselves. Thats not the point. I also don't want the state
monitoring people's child rearing. The child abuse industry is already
far out of proportion. Under some of the proposals mentioned here,
Amish people would be considered criminals. Why? Who have they hurt? I
have no fascination with or desire to aid other people's children. I
want them to leave me alone, and leave my children alone, and anything
that weakens that in the name of "the common good" is going to end up
hurting ME in the end, given that I'm a strong nonconformist.
