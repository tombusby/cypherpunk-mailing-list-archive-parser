I tried to discuss a very similar plan several months ago (maybe as long
ago as a year, I don't remember). No one seemed interested in it.  Many
people seemed to think that a newsgroup for this sort of a thing was a
waste of bandwith.  I don't really agree, and think that the bandwith is
neccesary for a distributed method of making the remailer net more robust
to remailers popping into and out of existence.

I still think it's a good idea though. shrug. maybe people will like it
better this time around.
