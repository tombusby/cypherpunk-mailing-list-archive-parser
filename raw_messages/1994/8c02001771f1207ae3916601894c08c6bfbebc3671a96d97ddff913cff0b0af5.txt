I need to examine the Plug-n-play spec.  But if it's forthcoming, I'd be
inclined to support the huge installed base.  The hassles are more
hideous with IRQs because there's less of them.  This application
doesn't really need an IRQ, since it's going to be polled anyway.  A
simple questionaire or install program can find a usable port that
probably isn't taken.  DosRef2.2 shows nothing assigned in the 0x400
range.  Maybe you can grab something unique in there.
