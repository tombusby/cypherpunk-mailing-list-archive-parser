Well...yeah....

Perhaps I should clarify: not DES with randomly-chosen fixed S-boxes; I'm
well aware that those that DES uses are the best for differential
cryptanalysis.

However, as Bruce Schneier points out (p. 242), *variable* S-boxes make
differential cryptanalysis impossilbe, as such an adaptive plaintext attack
relies on knowledge of the composition of the S-boxes. If the boxes and
their contents change with both keys used and plaintext--probably with the
help of a strong RNG--then the only way such an attack could work would be
by first figuring out what causes the changes in the S-boxes; in that case,
the attack is probably already finished, by other means. Perhaps, even, the
S-boxes could change with so many chunks of text--again, variable, of
course.

Most, if not all, of the actual S-box designs used would be much weaker
than the original design of DES for differential cryptanalysis. However,
each different plaintext (and key) would use different s-boxes, so that
particular attack isn't possible.

So, I guess part of my question should be, does this open up other attacks?
Or, for that matter, am I completely wrong? And, like I said before, has
this been done?

Certainly, until there's something better. I'm just hoping this might be,
or that I can learn more along the way.

And thanks to Bill and Lyman, who also responded similarly.
