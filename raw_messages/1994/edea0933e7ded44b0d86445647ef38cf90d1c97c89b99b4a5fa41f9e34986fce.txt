What follows is part of a dialog I am having with netcom support right
now about the use of the Screen hyper-shell.  I've been using it
between home and work and it is awesome if you have never seen it.  The
man pages for it in ascii are ~rcain/pub/screen.man if you are on
netcom and want to check out what it can do.  There is someplace here I
could put it for anon ftp if somebody could tell me the name of that
drirectory from a netcom shell.  The dialog starts as a discussion of
the problem I have with the two or three minute inactivity timeout on
the San Jose modems and is mostly about the low impact I see it having
on resource usage.

If you know all about Screen or aren't really interested in a bunch of
justification, go forward about 100 lines to get to the part that
discusses crypto.


Peace,

Now, while all this is true in theory, in all honesty I am too deeply
involved in other things (like a day job) to actually do the
implementation I speak of but I *do* have all the tools if anybody else
wants to take a shot at writing the filters.  Since screen runs across
rlogin just fine, if this were done I could rlogin to any other machine
on the net and have a secure session across the net.  I think it could
also be made to be secure across "talk" or "irc" sessions and even
email between machines.  It could also be used as the front end to any
text based telnet port too.  So if you want to be able to dial in
securely at least and communicate with a system that is secure, and
across systems that are secure badly enough to put the time into it (or
pay me enough to quit my day job :-), here is a chance to maybe make
some history.

I think this is the right way to get a start on global network
security.  Screen offers such a rich environment for single windowed
connections already that it is a natural starting point given that it's
author has thought ahead to the kinds of filters we need.  It also
could care less what shell you run and it is transparent to the
applications running below it (from the experience I have had to date)
It is a work of art to begin with IMHO and with this crypdec capability
there would hardly be a reason not to use it since if you don't know it
and don't want to learn, you won't know Screen is there until you
invoke it's commands with the ctrl-A key (which can be changed to
anything else as an escape if you use applications that are fond of
ctrl-A.)
