I think that you are refering to IBM's "Technical Disclosures" publication.
Its entries are in the form of patents, presumably in less finished form.
They carry thru the process of writing up the patent, at least in rough form,
and then decide whether to go to the greater expense of patenting it.
If they decide not to patent it they publish it in Technical Disclosures.
