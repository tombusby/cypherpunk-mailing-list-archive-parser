>MULTI-INDUSTRY COALITION SETS TECHNICAL FRAMEWORK
>FOR THE NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE
>
>
>
>Washington, D.C. -- Today, more than forty leading communications,
>computing, and services companies proposed a consensus vision of the
>architecture required for tomorrow's information superhighway. In addition,
>the Cross-Industry Working Team (XIWT) members detailed an example of a key
>component of the National Information Infrastructure (NII) - digital cash.
>
>The two white papers, 1) An Architectural Framework for the NII  and 2)
>Digital Cash, Tokens and Payments in the NII, will be presented to the
>President's NII Advisory Committee tomorrow at its meeting in New York.
>
>"These papers provide a technical vision and goals for the NII that cut
>across a range of industries," said Robert Kahn, President of CNRI and
>chair of the XIWT Executive Committee. "They provide a common foundation
>for thinking about the objectives and technical requirements of the NII."
>
>In its Architecture paper, XIWT calls for an NII that promotes
>interoperability and provides universal access, privacy, protection,
>intellectual property, security, job creation and commerce in a competitive
>business environment. Based on these objectives, XIWT defines the NII in
>terms of a Functional Services Framework -- a model used to characterize
>the NII by function and certain key characteristics.
>
>According to this model, the NII has three basic components: applications,
>enabling services, and physical infrastructure. Together, these components
>include all the NII's information and transporting machinery, the networked
>software tools that facilitate manipulation and movement of digital
>information, and the information processing activities of NII users.
>
>To meet the goals outlined for the NII, XIWT recommends that each of these
>components be addressed in terms of functionality (what it does), trust
>(the conditions under which it operates), and control (how it is managed).
>
>XIWT also provides a Reference Architecture Model for the NII -- a
>description of the system in terms of the interconnection of the functional
>elements of the system and the interfaces between them. XIWT identifies
>four functional elements: 1) appliances: 2) networks; 3) resources; and 4)
>control points. In addition, it identifies seven categories of interfaces
>and protocols needed to integrate these elements and make them
>interoperable.
>
>The Digital Cash report defines ways in which the NII will facilitate
>existing and new forms of commerce. "It describes the functional
>requirements and technical options for conducting everyday financial
>transactions in networked electronic settings with the ease and certainty
>of today's cash economy -- and with more security and control," said Dan
>Schutzer of Citibank who chairs the XIWT Applications Services Working
>Team.
>
>"The flexibility and choice implicit in the architecture we have described
>will be a boon to the users of the NII and provide a challenging but
>fertile business environment for savvy companies in many different
>industries," said Niel Ransom of BellSouth, who chairs the XIWT
>Architecture Working Team. "The members of XIWT are committed to making it
>happen."
>
>The XIWT papers quickly received praise from the White House. "By bringing
>together the views and technical recommendations of such a diverse group of
>U.S. companies, the XIWT has made significant progress in moving the work
>on the NII another important step forward." said Vice President Al Gore.
>"We commend the work they have done so far and urge them to continue
>working to define the technical aspects of the NII."
>
>The Cross-Industry Working Team (XIWT) was formed in 1993 to develop a
>technical vision for the NII, XIWT members include over forty companies
>from a range of U.S. industries. Membership list attached.
