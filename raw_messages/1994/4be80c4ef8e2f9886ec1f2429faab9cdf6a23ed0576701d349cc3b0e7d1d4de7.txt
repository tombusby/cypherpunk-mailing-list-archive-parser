Could someone e-mail the manual to me. I accidentally deleted the posting
of it.

Watch your attributation, this was not my quote.

I personally would counsel people to be quite cautious about distributing
the document in question actively.

There is a case to be made if you know the material is restricted and you
send it out anyhow.

I don't think this applies to Grady, who seems to have forwarded the
material as a "is this real" project.  Now that he has indicated the
material is of some interest to NSA, anyone sending the document back
and forth should really be cautious.

For the less paranoid:
Most of the information in the document, as I indicated before, is not
damning by itself.  It is the distribution that is offensive to the
powers that be.  The question is how obnoxious and picky the enforcement
side wants to be and what the background of the leak is.

If this is material put out by someone who might otherwise be in trouble
it might get nasty out there.

I don't think I'd want it on my ftp site, let me put it that way.

The FOIA exemption for administrative materials is what worries me most.
