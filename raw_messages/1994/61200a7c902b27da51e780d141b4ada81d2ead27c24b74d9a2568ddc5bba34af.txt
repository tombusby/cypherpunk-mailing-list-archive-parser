What about this as a standard?:

Have the offset default to the checksum-value of the reciever's public key!  
The sending program could have the user specify the reciever, look his key
up in the public-keyring and offset the message accordingly.  While, the 
recieving program would automatically scan the file starting at the 
appropriate offset based on the same public key checksum-value.

No secure channels would be necessary for dissemating offset values.  
And, one's opponents wouldn't know where to look unless they knew:

  1 - That there may be a message hidden in the file.
  2 - That it is hidden with this particular stego standard in mind.
  3 - The reciever's public key.

Adopting this as a standard would, in my oppinion, offer a great advantage
over simply using a constant offset.

Of course, as it has been pointed out, there should always be the option
of providing a custom (non-standard) offset in the intrest of greater 
security.

PS:  This could also be implemented using any combination of the 
     checksum-value(s) of the sender's and/or the reciever's 
     public/private keys.  However, this will have very different
     implications from the suggested method.
