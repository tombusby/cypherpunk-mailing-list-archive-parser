hello all,

does anyone out there have a macro for the editor _brief_ by borland (last 
time i checked) that will invoke pgp to sign a message in the buffer. i've 
been using _brief_ as my primary editor since they were owned by _underware_, 
(no joke), and would like to be able to sign messages by pressing a hot key. 
i've been trying to do this off and on for some time, but my programming 
skills are almost nonexistant. preferably it would be filename independant. 
that is, it would work on the current buffer. the package was written
to be able to compile files while within it, so it should be
possible.

any help would be greatly appreciated.

thanks,

amp
