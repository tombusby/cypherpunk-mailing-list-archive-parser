A Proposal That It Be Resolved:
    * That Eric can, and will, do as he sees fit with the Cypherpunks
mailing list on toad.com.
    * That Eric can, and will, do whatever he's going to do, whenever he
does it.
    * That many have made their positions clear - amply, and repeatedly - on
what they think of the various proposals put forth in response to Eric's
initial posting, the clarifications, the clarified clarifications, the
counter-proposals, counter-counter-proposals, ad nauseum.
    * That if/when Eric does something that those on the Cypherpunks mailing
list do/don't agree with (or otherwise find inconvenient, distasteful,
awkward, reprehensible, foolish, appropriate, called-for, suitable,
necessary, ad nauseum), they will respond as they feel appropriate.
    * That responses to any actions taken by Eric may include letters of
support/condemnation, forged/faked information, leaving in a
snit/huff/quietly/loudly, formation of a C1Ph3rD00Dz mailing list, ranting,
raving, cheering, applause, or whatever else the individual may feel
appropriate.
    * That Eric has had ample opportunity to see the response to his
proposal, and will therefore take it into consideration as he feels appropriate.
    * That the subject will not be properly addressed and resolved until and
unless some _definitive_ action occurs.
    * That until and unless such action occurs, anything else is so much
flailing about madly, with a fair measure of High Blood Pressure and Hurt
Feelings tossed in.
    * That the subject has now been flogged to death, and that further
discourse on it only serves to fragment the CP mailing list.

Respectfully Submitted

Dave Merriman
