If you're not interested in yet another e-commerce vendor, delete away.

My POP newsgroup just put this up.  Looks like CommerceNet has some
competition.  These folks claim that they're doing something different
from secure mosaic.

I'm going web diving in DA now, and I'll tell you what I find out.

Cheers

>    DOWNTOWN ANYWHERE BRINGS ONLINE COMMERCE TO THE INTERNET
> 
> Downtown Anywhere Inc. announced its World Wide Web-based online
> environment known as "Downtown Anywhere(sm)."  Laid out like a
> thriving metropolis, Downtown Anywhere's Museums, Libraries, and
> Newsstands provide free and friendly access to global Internet
> resources, while its Main Street allows visitors to browse goods
> and innovative services that can be purchased with a few
> keystrokes.  Downtown Anywhere boasts the first real-time
> consumer-oriented credit card processing on the Internet, and
> its innovative Personal Payment system eliminates the need for
> transmitting sensitive credit card numbers over the Internet.
> 
> The Downtown Anywhere economy integrates the technologies of its
> parent companies.  AnyWare Associates' telecommunications
> technologies, coupled with SoftLock Services' proprietary
> telephone-based purchasing systems and patent-pending password
> technologies, provide the unique capability to offer true
> electronic commerce on the Internet.  In minutes, anyone with a
> credit card and a touch-tone telephone can acquire a Personal
> Payment Password(sm) that can be used easily for online purchases
> in Downtown Anywhere, and at other participating sites.  In
> seconds, information about online purchases of physical goods or
> services is transmitted automatically by electronic mail or fax
> to the merchants offering those products.  And, if the product
> is a SoftLock-secured document or program, the purchase can be
> fulfilled instantly with the online delivery of a SoftLock
> Password, which unlocks the product on the user's system.
> 
> According to company co-founder Jonathan Schull, "We have tried
> to eliminate the technical and financial barriers that have
> tended to leave would-be merchants and consumers hitch-hiking
> beside the information superhighway.  Visitors will find
> themselves in a comfortingly familiar environment that is
> interesting and diverse."
> 
> Sanford Bendremer, co-founder of Downtown Anywhere, said, "We've
> already seen tremendous interest from small and large
> organizations, that will be joining us in Downtown Anywhere. 
> Advertisers and merchants are looking at the dramatic size and
> growth of the Internet, and they are seeing this media as a
> powerful tool to reach customers."
> 
> Bendremer added that setting up shop in Downtown Anywhere can be
> inexpensive because the company has a stake in the success of
> its clients. "We will certainly rent advertising space and prime
> virtual real estate to those who want to pay for it, but since
> we provide the transaction processing and communication services
> that can make virtual businesses succeed, we will accept
> commissions in lieu of up-front payments.  We are also committed
> to offering inexpensive accommodations to people and
> organizations that can help us increase the richness and value
> of our environment."
