Can you spell O-V-E-R-K-I-L-L?  This might be an interesting
homework exercise but even 128 bits of keyspace is nowhere near
being exhausted by the set of passphrases contemplatable by the
average human.  Bigger is not always better or more useful.

I have to agree with Phil here.  While the guts of PGP are
extremely useful for building other crypto applications, we
should avoid using the name PGP for anything other than the
products given that name by Phil and his assignees.

Otherwise, PGP's reputation will almost certainly be diluted by
association with large numbers of derivative applications, which
although useful, have not already proven themselves over time in
the same way that PGP has.

A good example of this is the popular disk encryption utility
which uses an MD5 passphrase hash and IDEA/CFB encryption similar
to PGP's conventional encryption mode.  As "Secure Drive", it is
a valuable addition to our privacy arsenal.  Calling it
"PGPDrive", on the other hand, would not have been a good idea.

We do not need a zillion other products with names like PGPPhone,
PGPTerm, PGPmail, and numerous hacked versions of PGP itself
floating around if we are to keep PGP synonymous in the public
mind with a single unambiguous gold standard for privacy and strong 
crypto.  

What Tom has done may or may not be a good idea, but he should call
it something that doesn't have PGP in the name.

TomCrypt perhaps? :)
