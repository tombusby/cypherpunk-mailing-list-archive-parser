A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.                                                               

       Title     : IPv6 Security Architecture                              
       Author(s) : R. Atkinson
       Filename  : draft-atkinson-ipng-sec-00.txt
       Pages     : 13
       Date      : 11/16/1994

The Internet community is making a transition from version 4 of the 
Internet Protocol (IPv4) to version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6). 
[Hi94] This memo describes the security mechanisms integrated into version 
6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6) and the services that they provide.  Each
security mechanism is specified in a separate document. It also describes 
how security mechanisms outside the scope of the IPng effort (e.g. key 
management) relate to the IPv6 security mechanisms.

Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-atkinson-ipng-sec-00.txt".
							
NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.
							
For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@cnri.reston.va.us.
							

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
