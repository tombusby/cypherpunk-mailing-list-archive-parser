D.C. Williams remembered the thread and Emailed me a copy.
(Thanks D.C.) It was in alt.security.pgp which is why I couldn't
find it.  I was looking in sci.math for something with the word
"prime" in the title. :)

I quote the interesting sections below.

Victor S. Miller, [who I suspect is the same Victor S. Miller I
knew at UMass Boston many years ago], published a nifty little
paper in the mid 1980's on the computation of the function Pi(n)
which gives the Nth prime as a function of N.  He had a table
giving the (10^N)th prime for n={3,6,9,12,15,18,...} which was
quite impressive.  Calculating the correct value for the
zillionth prime directly is a cute bit of mathematics.
