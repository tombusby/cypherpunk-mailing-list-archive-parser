It really isn't to most of the individual banking entities' advantage for
interstate banking to exist because almost all of them would merged out of
existence. It isn't the regulators' fault; it's a wonder they got this far
as fast as they did, and that's primarily because the foriegn markets are
driving the regulators to it. Regulatory arbitrage. If there was a clearcut
financial advantage to interstate banking to First Podunk Bank and Trust,
it would have happened already.

Which, I believe, is the point of this thread.  It's time to shuck and jive
a bit.  If it can be demonstrably proved that a market exists, that there's
some boards of directors for those hoary old regulators to sit on in their
golden years, then there's a chance to make retail trade settlement a
reality.  You can't do that without a legimate test, and you can't get that
without mau-mauing the regulators some, eh?
