This post gives numerical examples to go along with Hal Finney's excellent
description of Brands' digital cash, posted earlier.  If the math is too
much, just remember the whole point:

I will use g = 10, n = 17389 as in the previous example.  Paul will choose 
x = 351 to be his secret key, so GX = 10^351 mod 17389 = 16987 is his public 
key.  In addition, the message is m = 1994.

Paul chooses a random w = 666

MX = 1994^351 mod 17389 = 11740
GW = 10^666 mod 17389 = 7115
MW = 1994^666 mod 17389 = 13262

Vicki chooses s = 3694, t = 1243

m' = (1994^3694)*(10^1243) mod 17389 = 10313

Vicki chooses u = 5192, v = 100

MX' = (MX^s)*(GX^t) = (11740^3694)*(16987^1243) mod 17389 = 10710
GW' = (GW^u)*(g^v) = (7115^5192)*(10^100) mod 17389 = 12113
MW' = (7115^(5192 1243))*(11740^(5192 3694))*(10313^100) mod 17389 = 9314

> Using these, Vicki calculates her hash c'= Hash(m',MX',GW',MW').

c' = hash(10313,10710,12113,9314) = 7672 (some hash function I made up)

> Now, the c she sends to Paul...
> c = c'/u 

c = (7672/5192) mod 17389 = 323

[     5192 c = 7672 mod 17389  
  --> 5192 c" = 1 mod 17389 
  --> c" = 3520
		 ==> c = c" 7672 mod 17389 = 323

  check: (323 5192) mod 17389 = 7672
]

> Paul will ... calculate r = c*x+w.

r = (323 351 + 666) mod 17388 = 9711

> [Vicki calculates] r' = u*r + v

r' = (5192 9711 + 100) mod 17388 = 11800

> The resulting signature on m' is (MX',GW',MW',r')

So the resulting signature is (10710,12113,9314,11800)

Okay, that should be an actual example of the protocol, unless I messed 
up somewhere ;)  I hope to finish going through Hal's third post soon.
