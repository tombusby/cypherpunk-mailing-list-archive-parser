I strongly agree with both Perry that it is amusing and with Eric
that everyone should read it.

But I see it as more germane than Eric. It is not about
arbitrary self perpetuating bugs from source. It is
about serious security holes that are self perpetuatated
by the binaries of the complier. The compiler ignores
its own source and generates security hacked binaries,
even when the source looks like it is corrected.

One strongly held belief among lots on this list and in the PGP
advocacy world is that the availability of source
guarentees security. Thompson's lecture throroughly dispells
that hope, crushing the "guarentee" completely.

Drawing from Thompson, a simple MD5 is not sufficient.
Youd have to have multiple compilers, perferably on different
cpu architectures, build the tool from source, and compare the
results. Then, and only then, could you claim that you were
secure.

Of course, this is far too much work to be practical.

And this approach is impracticale without need to invent a conspiracy
between the compiler developers.
