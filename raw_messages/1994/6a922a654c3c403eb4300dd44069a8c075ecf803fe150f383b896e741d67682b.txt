I'll also post this to the list since I need to correct a dumb
error in my previous post.

I previously stated that Pi(n) was the Nth prime.  It is of
course in reality the Prime Number Counting Function which is
equal to the number of primes <= n.  Computing the Nth prime is
trivial given a program which computes Pi(n) since Pi(n) is
asymptotic to a known smooth function and one need only evaluate
it a small number of times to refine an initial estimate of the
Nth prime into the correct value.

Miller's definitive paper on the subject is...

There is another paper by this gentleman which may be of interest
to Cypherpunks.  It is on the use of elliptic curves as a basis
for cryptosystems.  He demonstrates how an analogue to the
Diffie-Hellman secure key exchange may be constructed using
groups of points on elliptic curves and conjectures that such a
system may be stronger than one based on the discrete log
problem.  Here is the citation.

Happy reading.
