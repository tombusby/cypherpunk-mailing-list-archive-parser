Greetings:

I recently posted a posting (whatever) looking for a programmer to do
some contract work.  After talking with a few people, someone suggested
that I post what I want on the mailing list.

What I am looking for is someone to do some of the odd programming
projects that I have been wishing someone would do.  This isn't work
that I have a contract to do, just things that I want to see done.
Most of it, probably all of it, will end up as public domain code.
I would do it myself, but 1) I am too busy, and 2) I am not really a 
good programmer.  I am willing to pay for time, but I can't
promise wages competitive with a commercial contract.

This stuff won't make anyone rich, but it will give someone a piece of
code you can put on your resume and may do some good for the world.

First I am looking for a simple MS-DOS file encrypter.  Something that
works off the command line and uses a few different algorithms.
Given that all of the algorithms are already in public domain C, I can't
believe this will take all that long.

After that I have an algorithm from Japan that I'd like to see coded up
in C.  Then an algorithm from South Africa.  Then some stuff on stream
ciphers.  And so on.

If anyone is interested, please give me some idea of what you would
consider a fair hourly rate.  And a telephone number, so I can call
and talk with you.

Bruce
