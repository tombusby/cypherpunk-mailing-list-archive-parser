Right. We went through dozens of messages to establish that some people like
MIME and others don't, just as we did several weeks ago. What a surprise that
not much has changed since then. Bleeding wonderful.

If it was "quite apparent", it's a shame you didn't make that clearer at the
time, rather than claiming it now. I saw plenty of flaming about various 
people's mailers and net connections. If someone was making points about
crypto there, they were doing a damn fine job of hiding it.

By this reasoning we should resurrect all the old firestorms about gun control
and child pornography. Analogies can be drawn, perhaps, but I don't feel
those discussions are appropriate here.

Good standards are good. There's a revelation. Yep, we sure needed dozens of
messages to rehash that. Right.

So why not talk about that instead ?

Exactly.
