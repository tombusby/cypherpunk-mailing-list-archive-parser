I agree with what Mike Duvos says here:

That's right. And the essay I just posted on "Corporations and
Encryption" is apropos. If, for example, Cypherpunks go along with
(or, worse, _advocate_) laws regulating crypto use in corporations,
then this is part of turning up the temperature on the frog.

It's worth noting again for any newcomers in the last half year or so
that Whit Diffie said at a Cypherpunks meeting that he think _civil
forfeiture_ will be used to suppress noncomplying crypto: corporations
will be told that only certain types of crypto are allowable, and
noncomplying crypto will be grounds for forfeiture of corporate assets.

I agree...the focus on the "weaknesses" of EES, rather than the deeply
flawed ethical, Constitutional, and practical issues, is mistaken. But
if folks want to put effort into this, fine. I don't. They can.

I'm sure there are those scanning this list who view such metaphorical
comments more literally, as a death threat against Bill Clinton and
his minions. They have no appreciation of irony.

Pushing strong crypto to the "tipping point," the point of no return,
is within our grasp.
