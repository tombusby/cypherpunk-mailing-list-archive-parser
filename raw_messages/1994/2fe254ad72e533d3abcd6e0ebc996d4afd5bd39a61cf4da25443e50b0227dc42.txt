Nah, Data Havens are well within the "charter". :-)

     This is your first, and foremost, problem. I'm not terribly familiar
with Perl, however, if it's half as anal-retentive as C is, make damn sure
you know your stuff, or at least have a trusted opinion on the subject (Hi
RS!! You know who you are!).

Agreed.

     Define your attacker. Who is this suppose to be "secure enough"
against? If it's Joe Avg. CompuGeek, yes, one should be "enough". If,
OTOH, the NSA is your intended foe, find 12. Then find 3 more. Then,
perhaps another 43. Then, MAYBE, you'll be "secure enough".

     You see, the problem with "secure enough" is that a good security
system, while not foolproof, makes the cost of attack substantially higher
than the cost of the information so gained. So, ask yourself: how much
"money" (IE: resources, time, and man-hours) is "too much" for the value
of the data and obscurity your DH will offer. Once you've determined this,
then, and ONLY THEN, have you determined how much security is "secure
enough" for your purposes.

     You'll pardon me for saying, but the hell with CI$, and to hell, even
quicker, with Fido. Anyone who's serious enough will find their way onto
Internet. Call me a purist, or a jackass, but the aforementioned are more
of a handicap than a help. I say drop 'em.

     Well, the only real way to do this SECURELY is for human intervention
to decide which keys are accurate and which aren't. Barring that, try
taking advantage of the keyservers. When a packet comes in, snag a copy of
ALL the keys this person has (and, perhaps, a few that haven't, just for a
confounding factor), and use them one-by-one until a match is generated.
Then, discard all keys. If no match, trash the packet.

Fair enough... multiple keys? How else?

     How about just saving the files under sequencial names (0000000001,
0000000002, base 62 (A-Z, a-z, 0-9))? Then, use a PGP-encrypted 1024-bit
key to encrypt the index file.

Pinging?

See above. . .

     To borrow a phrase from X-Files: "Trust no one." (X-Files, btw, is a
very cool show. New season started yesterday. Friday, 9pm, FOX). The
problem is a chicken-egg paradox: If no one uses your DH, what kind of
reputation can it have, but, in order to get a reputation, one has to use
it. . . I dunno how to handle this.

> 11: How would a DH turn away files because the disk is full?
     Don't accept files when less than 5% of the drive is full. Send back
a confirmation code different from that of a successful transfer. Either
that, or trash the packet, adding a rather cryptic bounce message. The
exact wording and protocol will have to be established first, and only
known to people who use the DH.

Glad you asked. I'm not hardly a guru, but there's my $.02.
