I have placed the "Xenon's Full Disclosure Remailer List"
up for anonymous ftp to netcom.com in /pub/qwerty.
I am willing to maintain it, by only to the extent that
people send me updates :-). It's format is free-form,
so add your own headers, or whatever. I am no longer
on the Cypherpunks mailing list. If someone is willing
to maintain this list, they can put their name atop it,
but I hope they will mail me new versions as they are
made. Thanks. Might you take the remailer discussion
to Usenet anyway? My list may end up in some form
in each new PGP FAQ version, by my mailing it to
Gary Edstrom who isn't on this list either.
