What we need are people to take a portion of them and format them for Unix
and Macintosh and any other versions of PGP that are there. Can the Unix
version of PGP fit on a single disk? Also, we have to have the sort of 
people involved who won't just take the disks and walk with them.

Piece of cake. My lover has his own desktop publishing buisness. With an
HPLJ4 at home. No problem. We can make professional-looking handouts too.

You have to wear a suit (or at least reasonably dressy clothing) to be taken
seriously at any Expo at all. 

One concern I have - did Zimmerman sell out to RSA yet? He was being sued
as I recall, and the latest info I have is that he watered down version 2.3
to shut them up temporarily. What is the latest on that, and is 2.3 still
the latest version of PGP?
