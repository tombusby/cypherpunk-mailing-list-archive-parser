Now you may not agree with Dorothy's stance on Clipper, but you can't
mar her academic record.

Yes, she is a college graduate and an expert in cryptography.  She was
a professor for a while at Purdue, and is now chair of the computer
science department at George Washington University.

She has written quite a bit, including _Cryptography and Data Security_
