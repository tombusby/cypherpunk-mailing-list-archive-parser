After a complete sellout at HoHo Con 1993 in Austin, TX this past
December, the official Legion of Doom t-shirts are available
once again.  Join the net luminaries world-wide in owning one of
these amazing shirts.  Impress members of the opposite sex, increase
your IQ, annoy system administrators, get raided by the government and
lose your wardrobe!
 
Can a t-shirt really do all this?  Of course it can!

"THE HACKER WAR  --  LOD vs MOD"
 
This t-shirt chronicles the infamous "Hacker War" between rival
groups The Legion of Doom and  The Masters of Destruction.  The front
of the shirt displays a flight map of the various battle-sites
hit by MOD and tracked by LOD.  The back of the shirt
has a detailed timeline of the key dates in the conflict, and
a rather ironic quote from an MOD member.
 
(For a limited time, the original is back!)
 
"LEGION OF DOOM  --  INTERNET WORLD TOUR"
 
The front of this classic shirt displays "Legion of Doom Internet World
Tour" as well as a sword and telephone intersecting the planet
earth, skull-and-crossbones style.  The back displays the
words "Hacking for Jesus" as well as a substantial list of "tour-stops"
(internet sites) and a quote from Aleister Crowley.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
All t-shirts are sized XL, and are 100% cotton.
 
Cost is $15.00 (US) per shirt.  International orders add $5.00 per shirt for
postage.
 
Send checks or money orders.  Please, no credit cards, even if
it's really your card.
