Greetings all,
    Yesterdays meetings brought up some interesting ideas.  Through the fault
of no one, the sound quality of the other locations was somewhat less than
exceptional.  If any of you who attended the other meetings can send out a
summary of what was discussed, I would appreciate it.

    We at the Wash. location were discussing what the next step should be
in the "Clipper vs. Privacy" battle.  Several ideas were brought up:
            - Create our own in-line secure phone encryption device to
                compete with Clipper-designed machines.
            - Increase public awareness of Clipper and what it may bring by
                using methods such as:
                   . Anti-clipper t-shirts, buttons & pins
                   . Anti-clipper memos on any and all BBSs and networks
                   . Anti-clipper letters to the editor of every newspaper
                   . et al
            - Continued polotical wrestling.

Washington attandees: If I've left out anything, please write it down and
                      send it out.

                                                     G.C.G.
