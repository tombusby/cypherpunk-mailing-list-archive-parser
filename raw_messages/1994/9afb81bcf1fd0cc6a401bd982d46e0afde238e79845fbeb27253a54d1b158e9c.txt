PGP lets you choose which key to use when you care, and
doesn't care what's in the Name field; if you want to implement behavior
inside of that it will handle it transparently; e.g.
	"Digicash: Eric Hughes <hughes@accounts.cayman.digibank.com>"
(though it would be nice if it had more Unix-like regexp code for 
selecting keys).

Policy isn't really the cryptosystem's job; it's the application's.

The intent of keyservers is to have a convenient mechanism for finding 
keys when you want them.  Having specific keyservers keep track of
specific bunches of keys is a reasonable use of that convenience.
Maybe a bankers' association would run a keyserver to serve keys
for banks and (if appropriate) for customers, with the location
known by most of the common software, and maybe a remailer
operators' group would do the same for their remailer cooperative.
There are a lot of wys to use mechanisms...
