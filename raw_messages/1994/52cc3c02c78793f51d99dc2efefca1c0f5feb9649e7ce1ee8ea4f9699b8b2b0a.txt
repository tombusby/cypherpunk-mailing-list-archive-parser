There are a number of good text files out on anonymous mail 
forwarding servers, but nothing that really "ties it all 
together", so to speak.  If you know of such a thing, please post 
it.  Anyway, let me ask a few specific questions:

I read that fingering ghio@andrew.cmu.edu will produce a current 
status of all "Cypherpunk" remailers.  I did so and it was quite 
informative.  However, "remailer@soda.berkeley.edu" was omitted 
from the list.  Is there a reason for that?

Do any of the other CP remailers (other than soda.berkeley.edu) 
offer a post-to-Usenet gateway?  If so, do they use the same 
syntax?

Is there a way to disable the encrypted reply address at the 
Berkeley remailer?

I know that a few of the CP remailers have a certain adddress, 
like "help@<address>" which will provide an info sheet by return 
mail.  Do any of the others support that?  If so, would "help" be 
used, or something else?

Thanks...
