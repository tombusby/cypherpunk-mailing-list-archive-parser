O(x) isn't a function invocation, its a complexity theory notation --
it basically means "order of". For instance, it can be proven that a
generalized sort algorithm that relies only on compares can be written
with time complexity no greater than a constant factor plus a constant
factor times n log n, where n is the number of elements. The constants
don't really matter, so we just call it an O(n log(n)) algorithm.

This topic can get really rich and I haven't explained it terribly
well -- I suggest a book on theoretical computer science. Knuth may
have a good explanation, but I don't recall.
