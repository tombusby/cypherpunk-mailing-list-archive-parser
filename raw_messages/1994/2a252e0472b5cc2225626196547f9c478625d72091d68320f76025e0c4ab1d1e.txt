This system can be tested with a small amount of capital.

Only two contracts will be in play at any time.  So, you need only put
up margin for two contracts.  This is feasible for less than $10,000.
When cash moves the wrong way, it can be funnelled back to the right
broker.  At the end of the game, we can review the brokerage
statements to see if the money ended up where it was supposed to.

Those who doubt Mr. Metzger's analysis should be able to find backers
who will supply this small amount of working capital.  I would guess
that Mr. Metzger would be willing to allow his critics to pool their
resources, should some turn coward or plead poverty.
