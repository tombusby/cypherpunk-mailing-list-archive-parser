Yep, still hosting the weekly L.A. Cypherpunks gathering at the:

California Coffee House
4455 Overland Avenue
Culver City, CA 90230
(310) 559-8868

Defend Your Privacy! from:
"Big Brother" Government and "Dark Side" Hackers
- ----------------
L.A. Cypherpunks

Help create an "Infotopia," don't support an "Automatic Gestapo."
Fight the Clipper "Snitch Chip."

Drop in any time between 12 & 5PM Saturdays (excluding holidays).
Let's plot and conspire, or at least exchange PGP key fingerprints.

Tune Out (media lies), Turn Off (freeway), and Drop In (for coffee).

Share information and sell stuff if you wish. I'm trying to get
political types to show up, in addition to us computer geekazoids.
Show up and get the latest brochure!

I'll be there this Saturday, but not the 24th and possibly not in 
early January (I did say "excluding holidays"). But don't let that 
stop you unless the coffee house is closed.
