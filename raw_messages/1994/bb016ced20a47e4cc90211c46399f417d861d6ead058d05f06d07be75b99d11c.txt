Many remailers offer a mail-to-usenet feature.  From Raph Levien's
most recent list of reliable remailers:

In addition, here are the names and syntax requirements of the
mail-to-usenet gateways that I know of.  Most of these I got by
fingering remailer-list@chaos.bsu.edu a few months ago.  I make
no claims that this list is either current or complete.  Additions
and corrections are welcome.

group.name@demon.co.uk
group.name@news.demon.co.uk
group.name@bull.com
group.name@cass.ma02.bull.com
group.name@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca
group.name@charm.magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu
group.name@comlab.ox.ac.uk
group.name@nic.funet.fi
group.name@cs.dal.ca
group.name@ug.cs.dal.ca
group.name@paris.ics.uci.edu (removes headers)
group.name.usenet@decwrl.dec.com (preserves all headers)
group.name@cs.texas.edu
group.name@myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu

Note:  mail-to-usenet gateways do not anonymize messages before
posting.  If you want to post anonymously use a remailer to send
mail to the gateway.

As far as your "message acceptance based on SUBJECT: line,"
I have never heard of any restrictions.
