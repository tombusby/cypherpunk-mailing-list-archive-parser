I have never heard a serious, reputable claim about the unbreakablity of 
an algorithm.  Any newbie that dares to pretend otherwise is promptly 
referred to the example of the NSA.  The biggest single purchaser of 
computer hardware, and employer of mathematicians.  Dozens of years ahead 
of public research and all classified.

The point is, that in the real world, we'll never know if our algorithms 
are "good enough to withstand an opponent who has full documentation of 
your algorithms and methods lots of funds, and everything except your keys."
This opponent need not be the NSA, per se, BTW.  With "lots of funds" 
they may have access to at least some of the NSA's findings.  And, who 
knows, the NSA may regularly hire its services out to the highest bidder.

You may trust your encryption alone, but if it ever comes to that, I'll 
hide any sensitive information I may have every way I can.

It certainly lookss like it takes a lot!  The Mimic function seems, to me, 
to be the only effective practical steganography application.  Most of the 
rest of the informed members of this group seem to be debating the 
relative visibility/invisibility of their respective systems.
