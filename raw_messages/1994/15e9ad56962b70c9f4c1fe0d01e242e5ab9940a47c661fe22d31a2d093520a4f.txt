-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

MIT is  pleased   to announce the    availability of PGP 2.6.1,   a free
public-key encryption  program  for   non-commercial use.    PGP   2.6.1
provides for   digital   signatures and  confidentiality of    files and
messages.

PGP 2.6.1 is  distributed in source   form for DOS/UNIX platforms.   For
convenience, an MSDOS executable is also part  of this release.  Because
source  is  available, anyone may  examine  it  to  verify the program's
integrity.

For Macintosh users MIT is currently distributing  MacPGP 2.6. An update
to MacPGP 2.6 will occur at a later date.

PGP 2.6.1 contains fixes to many of the bugs reported in PGP 2.6 and MIT
encourages all U.S. PGP users to upgrade.

How to get PGP 2.6.1 from MIT:

PGP 2.6.1 is  available from MIT only over  the  Internet. Use anonymous
FTP  to login  to   net-dist.mit.edu. Login as   anonymous. Look  in the
directory /pub/PGP. In  this directory,   available  to everyone, is   a
README file   a copy of  the RSAREF  license  and a  copy  of a software
license  from  MIT. Please  read   the  README file and  these  licenses
carefully.  Take particular note of the provisions about export control.
The README file  contains more detailed  instructions on how to get  PGP
2.6.1.

Also  in /pub/PGP is  a  copy of  the  PGP Manual (files pgpdoc1.txt and
pgpdoc2.txt) and the file  pgformat.doc that describes the PGP  message,
signature and key  formats, including the  modifications for  PGP 2.6.1.
These are  being  made available  without  the distribution restrictions
that pertain to the PGP source and executable code.
