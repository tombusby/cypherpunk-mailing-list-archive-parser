Not at all.  It would, however, forbid me from posting his home address and
phone number to the net with the notation "This son-of-a-bitch sold me a
lousy pizza!  Feel free to phone him at five a.m."

Er, file a harassment or stalking suit against _whom_, precisely?

"Hey!  Two wrongs _do_ make a right!"

I don't view it as being germane to the matter at hand.  I do feel that
posting copyrighted material via an anonymous ID is wrong.

Do you claim that a person without an unlisted number has no right to
privacy as far As the phone is concerned, then?

Oh, well, that makes it just fine, then.

Here's where we differ.  By failing to include his home phone number and
address in his postings, I believe that Mr. Nalbandian _did_ make "the
slightest effort".  If he had included them in his sig, for instance, I
would agree with you.

>Had Mr. Nalbandian only signed his first name, I would
>be on your side.  As it is, I cannot see it your way.

What if he had only signed his first name, but included his last name if
you were to finger his account?

>I only assert that Mr. Nalbandian 
>has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his name and phone number 
>when he all but hands them out.

I think it's that "all but" that we're stuck on here.  By your reasoning,
anyone whose phone number can be derived by anything short of illegal means
is "all but handing it out".

>I think we both agree that Mr(s). Anonymous way crossed the line with the

Yes.
