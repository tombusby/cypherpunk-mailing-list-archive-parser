A "gopherhole" and "message haven" are the same thing.
We were using the term "gopherhole" because it was suggested that
gopher be used as the underlying mechanism for a message haven.

Yes.  Under this model, a message haven must be trusted.

This flavour of message haven would not require persistent tables.
A crooked operator /could/ maintain them, but unlike penet they are
not required.  Every time you log into a message haven, you tell it
what tags you are interested in.  Here the level of trust is similar
to that of a regular remailer.  The remailer /could/ keep logs to
destroy your anonymity, but we hope it doesn't.

I realize this solution is far from ideal.  But as I posted before,
I don't believe the numbers favour a message haven where everything
is downloaded.  I have this nagging feeling that there is some
very elegant cryptographical way of doing this employing secret
sharing, but I can't actually think of how to do it.
