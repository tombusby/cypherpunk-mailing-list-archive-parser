The manual below has info on old, current, and proposed info on all D/Ls and
IDs. It also contains info on Credit Cards, Alien, Miolitary, and other
various types of Federal Identification. There are no PICs of FBI, DEA, CIA,
etc--except for 1-800 numbers to confirm who they are.

for 17.95; send to: Drivers License Guide Co., PO Box 5305-Dept. 94, Redwood
City, CA 94063. You can call 1/800-227-8827. This is the one bouncers use at
nightclubs. Not as detailed as the one below.
