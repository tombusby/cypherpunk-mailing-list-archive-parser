There are much tougher tests for random numbers than these, particularly 
if they are to be used for Monte Carlo where the numbers are used as 
m-tuples.  The tests you really need to make are the ones George 
Marsaglia calls the 'monkey test' and the 'birthday test', as well 
as the m-tuples test.  The first two are generalizations of the 
well known statistics problem of the monkey typing Shakespeare and 
of coincident birthdays in a group of people.  They are tough to pass. 

The problem as I see it is that 4-bit numbers do not generate much 
variability, so you will really need m-tuples of 4-tuples of these. 
This increases the chance that long range correlations will catch 
up to you when you least want them. 

I am sure George would be interested in this, however, since they have 
been looking at ways to incorporate physical noise that is truly 
random into the very sophisticated generators like the combination 
of lagged fibonacci with congruential.  The problem is that noise 
is seldom random enough, according to talks he has given.
