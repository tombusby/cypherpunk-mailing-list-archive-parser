Sorry to post this again. This one works.

# SuperPing: Ping Cyperpunk remailer connections.
# Brought to you by Xenon <na38138@anon.penet.fi>.
# Thanks to Alan Barrett for teaching me some perl.

# Replace $Rm[$First] below with YOUR address to test this!
# Warning: outputs ~40 e-mails at a time. May give "too
# many processes" error towards the end if you haven't killed
# all of your stopped jobs. Increase the sleep(sec) time if needed.

# Will also function as a convenient method to shut down all
# remailers at once by making .PingFile 500K instead of 1K.
# Not recommended if you value your life ;-).

# List of remailers (not complete).
# Make any line a comment to remove that line's remailer.
