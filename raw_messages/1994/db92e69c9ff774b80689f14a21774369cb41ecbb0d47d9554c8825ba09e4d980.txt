Recently, I wrote about forging mail and introduced the idea of
honor in cyberspace:

to which Jim McCoy responded:
>Like what?  When identity is "weak" then honor has no meaning...

That sounded reasonable to me until Crim Tideson asked:

>I've created a pseudonym and a PGP key pair for that pseudonym.  ... 
>I have no intention of revealing who "me" actually is.  ...
>I want to make and keep a reputation.... 

So honor may after all have meaning in cyberspace, as some code of
behavior that preserves one's "reputation".


James A. Donald, whose thinking I tend to respect, points out that,

I'm glad to take your word on this. But I still think that the 
cryptographic system can be broken: subversion, torture, and "truth
serums" come to mind. If someone strong enough wants your secret
badly enough, they can probably get it, as long as at least one 
keeper of the secret is alive. This argument relies on one's
adversary having no scruples. Since, as I mentioned before, I have
little knowledge of the mathematics of cryptography, but still share
the cypherpunks' interest in liberty, I'm focusing my efforts on the
social end of the solution. As I said:

What do you mean by "dishonorable"? Is walking through a security
hole like walking through a stranger's insecure door? The latter is 
an invasion of privacy to me, something I would consider damaging 
to me and would label a "dishonorable" act.

Consider reputation systems, kill files, and the famous "If no one
reads your posts, you're dead." Death is a pretty severe consequence,
and one that many people admit to imposing.


For target practice, I suggest that at the most basic level, net
entities will have "honor" or a good reputation who do the following:

	1. Tell the truth.
	2. Keep their agreements.
	3. Do not injure their neighbors.
