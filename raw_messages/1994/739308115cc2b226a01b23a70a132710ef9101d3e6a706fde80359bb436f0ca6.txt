Ames may have had access to the rationale Dot and an un-named white
house source were quoted to effect ' ..if you knew what I know, you
would understand the need' (in effect tying Clipper to national security).

Were he to compromise how good the interception is IN THIS COUNTRY to
a foreign powers intelligence service, for instance,  it might severly
change their way of doing communications in the U.S.  (the target country).

Thus, nullifying some of the effect of say, a hypothetical successor to
SHAMROCK, (Allen Steeles Big Ear).
