Etc.  I've been using PGP for authenticating my packet messages for
some months, for precisely the reasons you outlined.  I get the
occasional "stop wasting bl**dy bandwidth" but most of the time it
results in more PGP users.  I'm also careful to explain that PGP can't
be used to prove I did NOT write an unsigned nasty-gram (until we get
true authentication within the BBS, by which I hope the concept of a
BBS will disappear :-) but it makes a strong case if I sign ALL my
bulletins.

Yes, we get forged messages on Amateur packet radio; some of them are
quite defamatory.
