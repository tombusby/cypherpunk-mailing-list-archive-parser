Dorothy Denning's article had a few interesting comments.

Are you saying the Justice Department are terrorists? :-)
Or merely that this will subsidize the Clipperphone industry enough that
honest cryptosystems will have a harder time competing?

Someone from NIST was also quoted in the newspapers agreeing that
only the stupider criminals would use Clipper.  On the other hand,
the government is trying *very* hard to get the cellular phone
industry to adopt Clipper, and I would think this deserves a mention,
since the government's limitation on the number oflayers in the cellphone
market  means that citizens don't really have a choice.

I've found this claim to be one of the most annoying of the Clipper 
proponent's claims.  The chip does *not* support two-agency escrow;
it only has one key, necessitating some insecure keyloading procedure
like the NSA-two-agents-and-a-laptop-in-a-vault charade.
But the rules for handling the keys are only set by the attorney general,
not by law or technology, and they are carefully written NOT to mention
or forbid any other access by anyone else - especially the not-mentioned NSA.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't El Rukn the street gang that
the government got in a lot of political hot water about for
bribing informants with drugs, sex, and reduced prison sentences?
