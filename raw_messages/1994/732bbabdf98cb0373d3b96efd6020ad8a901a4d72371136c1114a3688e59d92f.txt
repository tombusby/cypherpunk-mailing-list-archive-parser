			Bay Area GNU Picnic!


Who: People who like or work on the GNU system.  Perhaps you.

What: A GNU picnic on the beach.  With grill, music, and filking.

When: Sunday August 21 from 4pm pm to sunset and beyond.

Where: Half Moon Bay beach.  More precisely, ...
	Take 280 to 92 West heading towards Half Moon Bay. Once 
	you reach Half Moon Bay, 92 will dead-end into Highway 1.
	Turn left on Highway 1 and follow til the next stop
	light. Turn right and follow this road to the end. The
	HalfMoon Bay State Park Beach is on your left.
	There is a $4.00 cover charge to get in but once paid,
	will let you in to any other state beach for that day.
	So, one could puruse the beaaches before coming to the 
	GNU Picnic. Half Moon Bay is north of Sante Cruz and south of 
	San Francisco.


Why: To have fun and get to know other people who use and work on GNU.


Please bring:

* Musical instruments. (ie. drums, flutes, and anything that makes a noise)

* Frisbies and other suitable toys.

* CDs and tapes to play. unset and beyon.

* Blankets and towels for swimming (it's gonna be cold though :).

* Food.  Bring something you'd like to grill.  Also bring another item
according to your last name.  If your last name  starts with A
through H, bring cooked veggies or salad.  If your last name starts
with I through P, bring dessert.  If your last name starts with Q
through Z, bring two quarts of a non-alcoholic beverage.  If your last
name starts with anything else, bring a dragon to grill the food.  (If
no one brings a dragon, we'll use charcoal.)

Note that there are some fresh fish stores in Half Moon Bay and there
is also a fresh veggie stand on the road to the beach. So you could 
possibly pick up something to bring "on the way".

Note: tabouli containing more cracked wheat than parsley is strictly
forbidden!
