Speaking of hi-tech related screen fanatsy I just saw an old (1992)
movie starring Robert Redford, Dan Akroyd and Sidney Poiters (forgot
- or never noticed - the title) with rather 'advanced' crypto ties.
A professor of mathematics, specialist in primes, had constructed a
'black box' (containing a matchbox-sized chip) that could break all
passwords in a few seconds. Lots of other fantastic machinery also.
And the NSA had a big part. Somehow the manuscript seems to have been
written by an author with some understanding of the implications of
strong crypto. An ex-starving cypherpunk??
