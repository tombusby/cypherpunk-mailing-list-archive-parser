I have at least a rough sketch of your political views in mind, Perry.
I wasn't trying to attack you - I was trying to correct something
that is a very common misconception. Just happens to be on a rather
charged topic.

Assuming it was a marketing survey, this makes a lot more sense.
They are going to look places where people selling things have a
good chance to sell, which tends not to be the blue collar sections
(where due to violence and educational differences, people are also
much more likely to be closeted, and results are skewed anyway)

Also note that income brackets are, to my experience, extremely
variant among gays depending on location, race and (here's the
biggest, it seems) sex.

Although I believe this is an apples/oranges situation on a number
of grounds (no comments on discussing fruit, please :), I see your
point. I still strongly disagree that such legislation isn't nessessary,
but that's neither here nor there...
