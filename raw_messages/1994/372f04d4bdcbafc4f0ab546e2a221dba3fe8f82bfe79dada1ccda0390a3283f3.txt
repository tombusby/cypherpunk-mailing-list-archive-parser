I'm an engineer at a TV station, one of our microwave receivers
at the 800 foot level of our broadcast tower has been getting an
odd  signal for almost 3 weeks, it's  black and white video of a
house and it's on 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Out of curiosity
I decided to find the house, it wasn't too hard I knew the
bearing and I knew exactly what the house looked like.

It turns out the house is in a middle class neighborhood in
Miramar Florida (about 30 miles north of Miami). The tiny
camera and antenna are crudely mounted with duct tape on a
telephone pole across the street , it looks like it taps into
the power lines for electricity. Nobody would ever notice it
unless you knew precisely where to look and what to look for.

We are receiving the signal at 2458 megacycles but I think
that's a second harmonic, the primary signal must be at 1229 meg, a 
government frequency, known to be used by the DEA.
