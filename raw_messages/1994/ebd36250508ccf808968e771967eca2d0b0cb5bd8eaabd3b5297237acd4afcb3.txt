The delays in getting data on and off the chip are too large and the amount
of space wasted in redundant functions is too great.  You might prototype
it using FPGAs, but even this is unlikely.  Why not just buy one of the
existing SIMD processors and simulate your target system?

People used to build fast processors out of separate chips (bit slices).
They don't do that any more because it's too slow and too expensive if you
are building in volume.
