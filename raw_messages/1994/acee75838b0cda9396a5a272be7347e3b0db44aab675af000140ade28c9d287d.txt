I never thought it was.  Thank you for joining in the discussion, BTW.

I welcome any and all of Bill Stewart's comments on this issue.
I have, since the beginning, noticed a distinct dislike of 
"security-through-obscurity" among the senior members of this and other 
similar lists/newsgroups.  Many people preach this dislike.  Most 
don't seem to understand its foundations fully; neverthelless, they 
consider it a closed issue and usually don't bother to explain why.

I am glad that you are offering your insight on this, Hal.

This is the most elegant solution,  I agree.

That would be ideal, I agree.

I do not trust my encryption to be foolproof.  If I believed that adding
noise at the front of the file would help, I would do it.  I still wouldn't
trust it, but I would feel safer with every new security-through-obscurity
layer.

This is my defense of security-through-obscurity:
  
Security-through-obscurity adds layers upon layers of potential effort 
needed by one's opponents to get at whatever it is that you are obscuring.
A good analogy would be the length of one's secret key.  A one bit key, you
would agree, is not very effective.  The bits in the key, the more effort
your opponent would have to expend in brute-force analysis.  Similarly, 
the more layers of obscurity one has, the more effort your opponent would 
have to expend in bypassing/guessing your methods.

I have often heard it said that one should always assume that one's 
opponent knows everything except one's secret key.  To me, this makes no 
sense!  If your opponent is good enough and determined enough to get by 
all the layers of obscurity you may have put up, than its just one more 
step to getting your secret key.

You have stated that my oppinion is naive.  Please enlighten me.

So the views of these naive new members should be "vigorously refuted" 
(ie. flamed) in the intrest of other naive new members?  Have you considered
changing that to "constructively criticised"?

I dissagree.  In a perfect world, with perfect encryption and perfect
steganography "random offsets" may be superfluous.  As it stands now, we
need all the obscurity we can get.
