(40 pages of quoted material mercifully not included here!)

I'd like to encourage my colleague Brian Williams and others _not_ to
copy 40 pages of stuff that's already been posted here just to add a
few comments (or even a _lot_ of comments).

One of the problems with a mailing list like ours is that the same
articles--be they announcements from the EFF or CPSR, articles from
the Wall Street Journal, or whatever--are being posted multiple
times. Sometimes because people didn't apparently see that the stuff
had _already _ been posted, sometimes because Cypherpunks is on a
"junk mail" list of EFF, CPSR, ACLU, etc. mailers, and sometimes (as
here with Brian) because folks seem to think the material _needs_
repetition.

Thanks for reading this.
