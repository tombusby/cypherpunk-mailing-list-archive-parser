Mr. Bennett is clearly a victim of the popular impression that privacy is
somehow new.  Anything which can be done with public key encryption can be
done already with private communications (whispers, notes which are mailed
and destroyed, secret mail drops, couriers, secret-key encryption, ...).

All the hype over cryptoanarchy is overblown.  We are capable of anarchy,
income tax evasion and secret bank accounts today.  Look around you.  How
much of that do you see in your own life?  What makes you think that you'll
see any more of it in 10 years?

P.S.  His claim that RSA markets RIPEM was humorous -- but sad.  Maybe it's
always like this when the general public gets interested in something
technical.
