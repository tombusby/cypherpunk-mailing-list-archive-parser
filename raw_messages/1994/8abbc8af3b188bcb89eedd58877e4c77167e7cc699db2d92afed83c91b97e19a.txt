   Like I've told other people, it's easy to be objective when the rest 
of your life isn't on the line.  But my college plans _DIRECTLY_ involve 
these people, and I can't afford to piss them off.  

   And yes, the students now know that they're being logged, and I've 
taught them to use cheesy crypt(1) encryption to handle it.
