Puh-lease.  Lets excerise a little basic logic here, Boxx.  If the
cypherpunks list is a list for cypherpunks, don't you think you'd find a
lot of them there?  And if, perchance, the cypherpunks are not an
overwhelming majority of the net.population, don't you think you'd expect
them to be "diluted" on the net at large?  Come now, the same dilution
argument can be made for archers, or dance instructors, or finger-painting
fanciers.  I don't think the cockroach metaphor is justified in any of
these cases.
