This thread on programming languages seems waaaay off the CP agenda. But then,
so was the rather interesting thread on futures and derivatives...

Well, just as I wouldn't recommend using CASE tools without a working knowledge
of C, in case 'ducking down' to a lower level is necessary, I feel that C++ is
useful to know as a language with all the OO of, for instance, Smalltalk, and
low level capabilities too. I've programmed in many languages and taught C++,
and find that what is important for productivity is not higher-level *languages*
so much as *environments* -- Smalltalk wouldn't be much fun without one.

Visual programming environments do greatly help in bridging this semantic gap.
I don't think the argument against them (slow programs) is really valid, or will
remain so for a long time. For most applications, including crypto, environments
provide optimized libraries for a number of functions. Most environments, such 
as Visual C++, provide for links to lower levels, allowing optimization for 
*really* critical routines.

How many people still program in assembly? I do sometimes, but more out of
enjoyment than necessity ;-)
