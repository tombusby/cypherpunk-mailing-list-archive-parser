You don't give us enough information.

Are your attackers looking for known parties?
How secure is your cellular?  Do you operate from a known or a guessable 
location?  Is your "Friend" known?  Suspected?  His location, guessable?  
Known?

If your location were known it would be a simple matter to monitor 
the area, say put a van just outside your site and wait for cellular 
activity of a strength that suggests your presence.  How likely would it 
be that someone else is using a cellular phone in your presence?  Given 
this, it is probably not difficult to obtain the billing/ESN number for 
your phone, and then obtain detailed traffic information about your 
transmissions.  Given that it is a simple matter to conduct a lower tech 
attack, say tempest, and pick up the conversation as you compose it, end 
running the encryption so to speak.  You think in too shallow a fashion.  
Security is about more than communications security.

Even if yours is perfect, how about your friends.  A tempest attack on 
his site while he is using Word for Windows is just as effective as one 
on you.

Modify this tactic to use a phone which uses several different ESN's at 
random or move your location often and at random.

Worthless given the above attack.

Again, unimportant given the cheaper low tech solution.

Been there, did that.
