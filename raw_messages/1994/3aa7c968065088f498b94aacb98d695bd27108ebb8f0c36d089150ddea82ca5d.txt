The lead article in the news section is an anti-Clipper piece by me.  The
news editor of High Times (Bill Weinberg) is a good friend of mine and an
anarchist.  He invited me to write the article.  He definitely appreciates
this stuff (though he's not a techie himself).

P.S.: Wednesday, I gave the first-ever Lower East Side schoolyard teach-in
on crypto.  The place where the talk was supposed to be held (ABC No Rio)
got padlocked by the cops at the last minute (the city's been trying to
evict them for years), so we just went across the street and held the event
in a schoolyard.  Basketball games and baby carriages all around us.  It
was a lot of fun.  Sort of felt like I was in the TV show "Room 222."
