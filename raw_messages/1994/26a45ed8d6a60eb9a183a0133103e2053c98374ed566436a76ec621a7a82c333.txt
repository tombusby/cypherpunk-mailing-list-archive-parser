So, it looks like cryptography boils down to making a lot of noise on the
_everything_ channel, to prevent the state from listening to it, but
that the case of an individual under suspicion is hopeless.

How terrible!

That almost scares you into being honest and paying your taxes and
everything again.

All of you cypherpunks who were hoping to hide your little secrets with
pgp, just forget about it: what cryptography is all about is to make statistics
look bland.

But I *am* paranoid, and proudly so, since the age of two. And you would
be too if you were into the business of getting cryptography down into the
real world instead of toying with theoretical ideas in front of a computer
screen.
