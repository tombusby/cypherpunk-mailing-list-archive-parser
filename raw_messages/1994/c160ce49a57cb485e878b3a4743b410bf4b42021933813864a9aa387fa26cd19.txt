Commercial use of the Internet can offer companies new opportunities
for improving products and services, reaching new markets, and
gaining competitive advantage.  But it takes more than just establishing

uses of the Internet, drawn from her book "Doing Business on the
Internet", and present some of the latest business resources available
on the network.

DR. MARY J. CRONIN has more than 20 years of experience in information
management and technology.  She is on the staff of Boston
College, and teaches information management at the college's School
of Management.  Dr. Cronin has written articles about business and the
Internet for Computer World, Internet World and Database magazines.
She is also the author of "Doing Business on the Internet:  How the
Electronic Highway is Transforming American Companies", a book that
addresses the Internet's impacts on and opportunities for customer
support, product research and development, and marketing.
