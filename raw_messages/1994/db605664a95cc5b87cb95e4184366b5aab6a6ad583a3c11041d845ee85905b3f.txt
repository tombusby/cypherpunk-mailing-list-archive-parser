Forgive my ignorance, since I've always viewed cellular phones as being
overpriced toys, but if the cellular network _didn't_ track the location of
a given phone how could it route incoming calls to it?  Some friends who
were visiting from New Mexico this weekend told me they had to inform their
service provider of where they were going to be so they could receive calls
on their cellular phone.

We've played with wireless mobile networking around here, and routers need
to keep track of individual nodes as they move around.  Are cellular phones
different?  Am I missing something here?
