Dear Perry:
	From my point of view it was obvious that Jeff was speaking 
figuratively about the JP Barlowe declaration of war.  Such was most 
likely a mere attempt at a funny.  You do have a knack for nitpickiness, 
perhaps I should get myself a lawyer before posting in your presence, 
otherwise I fear your accute sense of perfection and astounding formality 
would overwhelm me.  Better make sure my sentences are all complete, and 
that I capitolize and spell properly for fear of recieving a dread Perry 
letter.  Take your personal piss-war with Jeff to private mail please, it 
seems that the majority of your posts in reply to him are filled with 
non-topical grammatical corrections and nitpicking of obvious oversights 
due merely to a sense of informality, and not the result of some evil 
attempt by Jeff to lead us all to our deaths or something.  
	Maybe Jeff does have a point  from the articles I have read it 
seems that JPB is considered by a large force of the media as bieng one 
of the leaders of the fight to conserve rights in kyberspace.  This could 
be merely because he is a prominent member of EFF, has been published 
numeral times on the topic, is well-known among people as a prominent 
personality, and his name is easier to spell.......
	But serisuly Perry, in this batch of mail I read today two of the 
three replies I saw from you were concerning mistakes in Jeff's posts 
that most likely because he and others maintain an informal tone in their 
postings.  I mean geesh are you gonna correct people from using Info 
Hiway, saying that this is obviouslyt a falshood and should be stamped 
out whenever possible...  
	It seems to me, tho I am a relative newbie, that you have a thing 
against Jeff, since most of those posts had little topic of value to the 
forum, except maybe to show your dislike of his stance perhaps you should 
take them to private mail.  

ANOTHER TOPIC:

	Is there room for informal discussion on here at times?  Or 
should we all be sure to maintain a modicum or formality.  I think the 
atmosphere is fine myself, it seems at this time to rather informal, but 
not babbly.


	You're eqipped with a hundred billion nueron brain, that's
	wired and fired, and it's a reality generating device, but
	you've got too do it.  Free youself  ----Tim Leary----
