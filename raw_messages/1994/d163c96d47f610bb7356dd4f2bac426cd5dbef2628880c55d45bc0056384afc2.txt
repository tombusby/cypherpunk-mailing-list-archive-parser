I assume that, in using the word "we" in this posting, you're referring to
yourself and your intestinal parasites.  You certainly have neither the
authority, the wit, nor the wherewithal to speak for _me_, Mr. Jeffers.

This post strongly suggests that you can barely speak for yourself.

I liked your presence _much_ better when you were absent.  A word to the
wise is sufficient, which strongly implies that you'll derive no useful
intelligence from this.

Just for the record, I think Mr. Bryner is a half-wit.  I don't find _you_
nearly that intelligent.
