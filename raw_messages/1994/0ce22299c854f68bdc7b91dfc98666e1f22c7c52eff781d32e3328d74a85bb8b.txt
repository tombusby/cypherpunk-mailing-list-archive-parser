I just spoke with Joe Barton (R) from Texas about the FBI wiretap bill.  
He is on a subcommittee that is hearing the bill.  He has heard _no_ citizen 
opposition to it.  I was not prepared, but he did invite me to send him 
my concerns  :-D

Folks, if we can generate a few hundred calls and well-thought-out faxes 
tommorrow, we might have some effect.  I don't know a lot about him, but 
he seemed to be of the opinion that he didn't really know that much about 
the bill.  It's up to us to educate him.
