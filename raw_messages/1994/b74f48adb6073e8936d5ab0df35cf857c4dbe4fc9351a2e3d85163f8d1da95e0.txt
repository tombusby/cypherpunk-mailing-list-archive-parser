If it weren't for LD's successful attacks on the remailer bramble, I might be
able to derive some amusement from this. As it is, this stuff just makes my
blood boil. If some government agency isn't sponsoring his antics, it certainly
should be. 

I used to be surprisingly willing to keep an open mind and take LD's claims
seriously; more than most non-paranoiacs, I think. He had a fair shot to gain
my support. Instead, he's made yet another life-long enemy. I hope I'm
making myself perfectly clear, LD. I don't despise you because Tim said so,
or Eric said so, or because of your criticism of the list. I despise you as
a direct result of your own deliberate actions. You've brought this upon
yourself. Feel free to slither away now.
