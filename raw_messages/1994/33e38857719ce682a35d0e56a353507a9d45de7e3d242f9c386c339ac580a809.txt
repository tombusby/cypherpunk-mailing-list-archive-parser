Yes, there are many ways to make nearly imposible to trace phone calls. 
Unfortunately, all that I know of involve stealing telephone service / 
toll fraud of some sort or another (in other words, if you are evading 
the trace functions for increased privacy, you are also evading the 
billing mechanisms...) For more info I suggest you moniter alt.2600, 
#hack, and #phreak. Also look into buying some back issues of 2600 
magazine as well as retrieving all the back issues of things like PHRACK 
magazine and CuD.

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
