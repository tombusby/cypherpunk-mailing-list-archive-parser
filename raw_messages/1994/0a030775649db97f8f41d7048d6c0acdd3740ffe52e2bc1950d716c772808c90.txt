Ouch. Neural networks are _deterministic_ (except, possibly, analog VLSI ones
such as Mead's).
Digital neural networks can't do _anything_  that cannot be done by 
algorithms; they run on Turing machines too. Why neural networks are 'magical' 
as Perry says, in certain classes of problems, is that they provide a way to
perform complex algorithmic funtions through a relatively simple interface
to humans.

In any case, how "fuzzy" do you allow your relative magnitude function to be?
Even if a function exists that compares keys with a magnitude difference of
the order of 100 bits, it's useless. For your binary search method to work,
this comparator function would have to be accurate when the difference is on
the order of just 1 bit. 

Yeah, quantum computers ;-)

Keep in mind that if you have a site that follows CERT advisories,
there are usually restrictions on which programs may be used to filter
mail. My site requires a sysadmin to put an entry in a config file to
allow any filter programs to work at all.

One standard filtering program that works well is procmail. This will
typically be "approved" by default and should keep your (Ed's) admin
from having to be involved in your incoming mail.
