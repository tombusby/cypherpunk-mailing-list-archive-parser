Paging Prof. Chomsky, paging Prof. Chomsky...

This is exactly the sort of information manipulation that can create a chain 
reaction on the net.  The infamous modem tax is a good example of this sort 
of cascade effect.  Use of "hot button" terms can product astonishing effects.

Yawn--this is the same old crappy broadcast paradigm that every govt drone 
that has looked at the net insists on regurgitating out of their craw.  The 
nature of the net is that everyone is a broadcaster, and the concept of a 
band of Newt-clones spamming the net is annoying.  It's good that these 
people are this clueless--someone that selectively and judiciously inserted 
a few posts here and there on appropriate newsgroups could have quite an 
effect, given an understanding of the language manipulation techniques 
mentioned above.

This gets right down to one of the fundemental differences between Usenet 
news and the WWW.  The Web is essentially a broadcast model for information 
exchange, even though everyone can publish their own Web page.  News & 
mailing lists, OTOH, give everyone involved an opportunity to respond and 
point out stuff that is complete bullshit.  Until you can hang responses off 
of Web pages, it will never give the value of the newsgroups and mailing 
lists, despite all the fancy fonts and glitzy graphics on the Web pages.
