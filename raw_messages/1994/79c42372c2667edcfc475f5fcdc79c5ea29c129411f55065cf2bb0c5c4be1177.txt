The classic reference is Volume 2 of Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer
Programming, Second Edition, Seminumerical Algorithms. I highly recommend
it to anyone wanting to know what "random" is all about.

If you really need to know whether your generator is random-enough for
your application you should expect to do your own testing and yes it will
require many hours of your time in addition to that of your computer.
