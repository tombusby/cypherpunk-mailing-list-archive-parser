This is very exciting!  Could you show some examples of how your code
would be used with Perl?  Some kind of script that could work with MP
numbers or RSA decrypt a file?  It would be very good to have a
prototyping language like Perl with crypto addons.

Try looking for a package called Shade using Archie.  Here is an excerpt
from the doc file:

As for the remailer return address idea, I would suggest looking at
Chaum's 1981 paper from CACM which has a similar concept.  I believe it
was posted here recently.  Instead of using shared secrets he had the
secret key at each hop get embedded in the return address itself.
