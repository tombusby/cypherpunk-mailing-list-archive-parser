I love this resurgence of the idea of "just a little" regulation.
How to be a plausible policy wonk straight out of the box.
As if it were a new idea.  As if that weren't how it always starts.
Oh boy, a new field for everyone to propose their two cents worth of
regulation on.

!  "We must make positive noises about small business while protecting the 
status quo."

I heard snippets of what must have been Gore, on NPR, talking to the
National Press Club.  Snippets because I would switch back to TV when
the commercials were over or...  Well, for instance (I paraphrase):

"I want to start with a story...
 Why did the Titanic fail to hear all the warnings about ice fields
 at their latitude?  Why did other ships fail to hear their distress
 calls?  Because the radio telegraph business was run *as* a business in
 those days.  No one was required to be listening<click>"

I know I should have let Star Trek tape and kept listening to this Guy; 
I just wimped.  Maybe he somehow completed his thought reasonably.

I hope things work out.  Gore and policy wonks and industry reps have 
all said good things, but also all those great short turning radius 
waffle words.

Like watchin' 'em spray the primer.
