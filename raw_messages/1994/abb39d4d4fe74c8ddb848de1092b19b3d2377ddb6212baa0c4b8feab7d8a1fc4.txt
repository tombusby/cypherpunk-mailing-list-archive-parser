   We are not talking about physical computers, we are talking about
turing machines. If there is some *finite* deterministic process to
get from the initial data to the final result, no matter how long it
takes, it is an algorithm. I'm sure I could hand you a composite
number that would require a computer larger and older than the
universe to factor. Does that prove that none of our current factoring
algorithms are actually algorithms, or that brute force isn't an
algorithm?

   If you have a different definition of "algorithm" then perhaps your
argument is right, but to me, an algorithm is a process to
get from A to B, regardless of how long it takes.

  Usefulness is a matter of time complexity, not a condition for
membership in the set of algorithms.

  Those definitions were invented to solve problems in the first
place.

  I can't think of a single thing which is non-algorithmic
except true randomness or non-determinism. Since no finite axiom
system can prove whether a string is truly random, no algorithm is
possible for generating nor proving them.  (anything with
infinite logical depth would also probably suffice) Err, I may
be mistaken since I recall that Chaitin said that you need
N bits of formal axioms to prove that an N-bit string is
"elegant" (the smallest representation), but I also recall
somewhere that a truely random string needs an infinite
set of axioms. Perhaps Tim can shed some light.

  Perhaps another example is a physical process able to solve the
halting problem. Imagine a time traveling UTM. Call it as a
subroutine. All it does is run your algorithm program and wait. If the
program ever halts, it sends the signal back in time, otherwise it
runs forever.  Thus, you feed the TT-UTM the algorithm you want to
check. If the program halts, the signal travels back in time from the
far future to arrive during the next "tick" of your current program.
If you receive no such signal, then either the universe died before
the algorithm halted, the machine broke down, or the algorithm doesn't
halt.

  The traditional "proof by contradiction" of the insoluability of the
halting problem doesn't work here. The algorithm used to test the
contradiction simply doesn't halt. It calls the TT-UTM recursively forever,
and creates an infinite number of them. In fact, this questions
the validity of the halting proof itself since the
contradiction derived isn't a valid input to the halt checking
machine in the first place, or, the halting proof disproves
logically the existence of time travel! Inputing an algorithm
to the halt checker which calls the halt checker should be
considered an exception like "division by zero" In which case,
the halt checking TT-UTM returns "exception: input algorithm  
recurses forever"  Thus, two new classes of algorithms are
developed. Those checkable by a TT-UTM and those which are not.
Those which are not should be left up to an even more
powerful machine. ;-)

(this violates the conditions of Church's thesis since the machine
can perform an infinity of calculation at each step. Oh well.)
