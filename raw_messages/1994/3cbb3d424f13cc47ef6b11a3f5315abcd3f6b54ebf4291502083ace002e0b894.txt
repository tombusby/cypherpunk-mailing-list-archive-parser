Hello Fellow Cypherpunks,

  I need help compiling PGP on DG/UX Release 5.4R3.00 AViiON.. There is no
target in the makefile that really fits the system here. I have consulted
the sysadm here and he told me to try adding #defines into the source, like
  #define BSD_SOURCE
  #define BSD_FLAVOR
  #define SVR4_SOURCE
  #define BSD_TTY_FLAVOR

  I don't want to fudge up the executable, and this isn't working. Someone
mentioned to me that i could try make portable. That did not work either.
I have gotten it to compile an executable, but only after giving me several
errors. 

  I have a little knowledge of c, so i don't need a complete hand holding.
If someone would extend a helping hand, i'd appreciate it. On a side note, i
have gotten the sysadm here to agree to install PGP2.5, should i be able to 
compile it and i let him know i did it! He won't install 2.3a. ;<.. 

  I'm using one of the crippled executables to sign this message. 

                      Thanks in advance,
                      Joseph R. Rach.
