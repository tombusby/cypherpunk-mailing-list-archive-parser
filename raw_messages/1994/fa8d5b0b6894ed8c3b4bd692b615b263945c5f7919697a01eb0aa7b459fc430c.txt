Subject: Government FTP site used to violate ITAR
Message-ID: <771826877/vac@FURMINT.NECTAR.CS.CMU.EDU>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


The version of the file fips181.txt with DES code, which was FTPable
from a government machine, (I saw it there some time back myself) has
been exported.  It is now FTPable from the UK.  

I did not see a "NO-EXPORTING" warning like most of us have, so they
could have even caused someone to violate US law unintentionally.
Maybe even someone who thinks that US law applies to everyone on Earth.
So even if someone were to export something from one of our FTP sites,
we still would not be doing something as bad as the government has
done.
