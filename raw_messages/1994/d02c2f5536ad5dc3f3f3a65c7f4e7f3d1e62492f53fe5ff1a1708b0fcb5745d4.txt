You might also want to check for low computron usage if you can and
generate a bunch of keys for later use when the machine is fairly
idle. (if it's ever in such a state - don't know if you are on a
multiuser system or not). that way, during peak times, you aren't 
burning big-time cycles generating keys.

the above is how i code. of course, i'm not a professional - just
having a good time.
