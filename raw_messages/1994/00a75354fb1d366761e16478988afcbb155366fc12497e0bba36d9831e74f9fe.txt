FWIW, I know Eric and can spell his name properly. From the numerous times
I've been in his presence, it's my humble opinion that he's about the
furthest thing from the bozo described in this flame that I can imagine.

Whoever posted this rudeness is cruelly clue-challenged about Eric's
character. From the content of his/her attack, this person should really
apologize, but from the puerility of it, I doubt the author is mature
enough to admit it. BTW, Eric was and is an early and consistent
contributor of quality thinking to this list as far back as I can remember,
which is early '92, has donate a lot of time and effort to helping maintain
it, and I have no problem with him being photographed or known as a
"founder." He's never in any way abused or even preened about it, afaik,
and seems appropriately non-egotistical at all times, both in person and in
posts.

I'm pretty sick of ad hominem attacks like this on the net, but they usualy
emanate from sleep-deprived teenagers with no manners who post anonymously,
and not from responsible individuals trying to add a voice of humility to
an important debate. Laugh it off, Eric, and ignore it (as I know you
will).

As for the idea of mandatory signatures: on the surface it's a pain and I
don't much like it, but then, it does do an important thing in promoting
"verifiable" posts. I don't post much material to the list (mostly I learn
from you guys), and don't find it particularly onerous. Someone who
contributes regularly might find it an inconvenience. Lots of things are
way more inconvenient, if you ask me (like applying for an FOIA report). I
think it might have the positive side-effect of providing an incentive for
people to post meaningful information, and not lots of noise to the list
(thereby somewhat diminishing the high volume). What effect does it have on
anonymity, though? That could be a serious sticking point: as much as I
dislike flames and idiocy from anonymous posters, I will defend their right
to post anonymously regardless of how unpleasantly it smells.
