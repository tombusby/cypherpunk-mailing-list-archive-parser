 This is a portion of mail that I sent to bill stewart.  Since bill seems to
 busy to send a critique, could someone else comply, please?

  How secure do you think this is?

  Three remailers:

  anon1+@a.edu
  anon2+@b.com
  anon3+@c.org

  Originator: boone@psc.edu (really igi.psc.edu, as Message-ID: shows)
  Receiver: wcs@anchor.ho.att.com

  ()Ka == contents inside () are encrypted with Public Key of A

  mail addressed to random+*@foo.edu == mail to user random@foo.edu,
					random's mail processor will
					deal with the +*

  The sender must encrypt his/her own address with the public key of the
  first remailer and put it in the X-A-R-P: field.

  Upon reciept of a message with X-A-S-P: set to non-empty, the re-mailer
  will strip off its portion of the address and decrypt the rest with its
  private key.

  It will add itself to the X-A-R-P: and encrypt it in the public key of
  the next remailer on the X-A-S-P:

  If there is nothing in the X-A-S-P: (after having removed its own address),
  then it needs to be sent to the To: address, so we set the From: address to 
  be the contents of the X-A-R-P: with its own address pre- & post- pended.  
  That way, the reciepient need not change his/her mail agent to respond via 
  the X-A-R-P: (or even need to include the X-A-S-P: in the outgoing response).

  If the message doesn't have an X-A-S-P:, the remailer checks the "To:"
  for the contents of what would have been the X-A-S-P: with its own address
  pre- & post- pended.  By stripping off its own address and de-crypting the
  resultant, it has the next address to send it to. 

  Barring wire-tapping, your privacy is susceptible in the logs (syslog, etc.)
  of the first remailer (a.edu in my example) or if all the RSA-keys for
  a.edu, b.com and c.org are broken.  To dampen wire-tapping, you could encrypt
  the contents of the message with padding, making traffic analysis more
  difficult.

  Comments?
