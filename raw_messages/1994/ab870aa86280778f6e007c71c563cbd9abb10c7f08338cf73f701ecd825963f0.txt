Why not do what the government does, in addition to coding messages, they 
split one message over different frequencies in a certain order. So you 
not only have to have the ability to decode the message, but you must 
have all the parts in the right order to get the intelligence of the 
message.  Instead of frequencies use different remailers.

Apply this to remailers, develope a program like premail 2.0 to not only 
get the keys for the month, this part may be accessed by a password, then 
have the program to split the message into enough parts that no 
meaningful intelligence is obtained from one part, encrypt the parts, and 
sent them out using reordering and latency.

Example: type a message, xsplit the message, encrypt the various parts of 
the message, use a password to access the secret remailer to get the 
remailer keys,  then send the encrypted message out in the order obtained 
from the remailer keys best remailers in order.  The recepient would get 
the parts of the message over 24 hours, and would have to get the 
remailer keys order from the secret remailer by password, reorganize the 
parts in order, add them together and decrypt the public key or one time 
pad message.

Being a remailer yourself would provide additional security thru obscurity.
Reordering and latency would apply as well.  Stealth might be overkill, 
but who would question a vacation portfolio?
