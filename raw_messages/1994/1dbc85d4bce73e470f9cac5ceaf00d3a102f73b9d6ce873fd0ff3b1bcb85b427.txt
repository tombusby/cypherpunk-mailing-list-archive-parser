From what Hadmut says, it appears that German law is as confused
as American law about whether freedom of the press means freedom 
of the press or not.

There are sometimes laws about this in the US, but if I remember correctly
the courts say they are unconstitutional.  They do suppress freedom
of speech and press, because they impose restrictions on content,
and because they make it easy for the government to find and
harass writers who oppose it.

In the US, you can get sued for saying untrue things about
people, except public figures, but only the victim can sue.
There are not supposed to be other writings which violate law,
but even so they make and enforce laws against pornography,
and in the past even speaking out against government policy
has been made illegal (Schenck case in World War 1, writing
pamphlets against the draft before there was one.)

What kinds of things are illegal to write in Germany?

I couldn't translate (2) - does this say they can make laws to protect
the young people from bad ideas and protect personal honor/reputation?

Of course you can fight against them without censorship - the weapon
to use is truth, said often and loudly.  If you use the violence
of censorship a against themyou are using their tools and you are
no better than them.  You also say, by censoring books, that the
common people are fools who can not tell the difference between
truth and lies.

We usually don't see German elections in US news.  Sometimes stories
about the rise of the right wing or Greens, and sometimes the results
of the elections.

When I was last there, I ate lots of Sauerkraut and beer,
and there were some blond women on the S-Bahn, but nobody in
Lederhosen.  People did bring dogs on the train...  :-)
