I should have said billions of potential states for the board after 
each move. If you think of the number of initial moves for the starting 
player its only 16 potential positions for the pawns and 4 for the 
knights. If the first player takes one of these positions then the 
second player moves he has the same 20 potential moves giving an 
potential state of 400 different positions after the first move. After 
the second move there is on the order of greater than 160,000 potential 
states for the board. After 3 moves it is greater than 2.56 * 10^10 
potential states. I was thinking in terms of states rather than valid moves.

Mike.
