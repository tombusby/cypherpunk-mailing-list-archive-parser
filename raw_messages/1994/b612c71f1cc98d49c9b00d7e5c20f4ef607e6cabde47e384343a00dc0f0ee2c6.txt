-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

On Friday, I got a message from Intergraph's chief counsel. "Great," I
thought. "I'm about to get my peepee whacked for making PGP available
over our internal software delivery network."

Nope. He wanted to discuss the finer points of its use. He'd read the
documentation and the _WSJ_ article about Zimmermann. He believes
e-mail isn't secure enough for his purposes but that PGP will make it
usable for him.

Where'd he get the software? From one of the 4 executive
vice-presidents here. Where'd he get it? No word yet, but I think I
know :)

It speaks well of our efforts that executives at a Fortune 400 firm
are not only aware of PGP but that they approve its use. Keep up the
evangelism. Keep talking to people. Keep answering questions. Keep
writing code.

If we build it, they will come.

	       Of course I don't speak for Intergraph.
