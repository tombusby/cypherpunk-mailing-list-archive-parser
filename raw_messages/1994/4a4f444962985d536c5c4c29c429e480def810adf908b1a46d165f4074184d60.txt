I am working on that exact problem. It is not really that trivial. The
encryption has to handle a lot of data real time. I have a license
agreement for IDEA and am working on RSA. I am thinking of using tripple
DES rather than IDEA because of the cost of the IDEA license.

Two questions. One: Does anyone know of a good source of DES chips?
Two: How much would you pay for a good encrypted phone?
