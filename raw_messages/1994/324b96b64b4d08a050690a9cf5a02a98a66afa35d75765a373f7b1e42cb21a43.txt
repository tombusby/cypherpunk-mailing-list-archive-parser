Amanda complained that Netscape pisses all over the
standardization committees.

Well guys, the victor has room to move.  It must come as a big
shock to Apple, Microsoft, and IBM, but reality is that Netscape
can set WWW standards and they cannot.

If they indulge the standardization committees by listening to 
them first, and then deciding to ignore them, the committee
should be thoroughly greatful.

Marc Andreessen:

Hey Mark, you are at netscape.  Please, tell them about
Debug Windows.

Tell them that when debug windows issues a "Fatal Exit" error
message this means that Netscape has trashed internal windows
data, and that Windows may crash at any moment for any reason.

There are no benign "Fatal Exit" warnings.  If it does not
crash your system, it will crash a customers system.

I now have a policy of rebooting after every use of Netscape.

This really bad -- though not as bad as waiting for Mosaic.
to finish slooooowwwwwwwwwly loading some huge document.
