Charles Osgood was also talking in his CBS Sunday Morning lead yesterday 
about the Infobahn that we will soon all be issued 1 "telephone" number 
at birth.  The Christians are also going on about these control measures 
because they match the "number of the beast" prophecy.

The problem with all of these control fears are that they are based on 
old technology.  THe authorities can try and work with identity control 
but software agents are people too.  Ever since the Trust was invented in 
England under common law, entities have been created and become "human" 
actors.  (On my "some day" list is an article on Trusts - The First 
Software Agents.)  Likewise corporations.

What good does it do to control (some) meat people if each person can 
spawn a hundred agents (often outside the jurisdiction) which can 
perfectly legally act on their behalf.  

I know it will be possible to force these agents to be linked to humans 
but that would only be at birth.  No control is possible over who has the 
codes to control the software agents of the future.  Additionally, all 
government controls on software agents are dependent upon businesses 
willingly turning away (unregistered) willing customers.  Hard to enforce 
on the nets.
