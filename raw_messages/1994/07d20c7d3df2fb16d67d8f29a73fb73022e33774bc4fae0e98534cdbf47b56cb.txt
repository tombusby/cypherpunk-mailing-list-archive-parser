>Kid Ranger Decoder Rings, it seems one of the things most on everyone's
>collective hive-like minds must be security.  Security and privacy, make
>that.
>  Now Discordians have always had a versatile and powerful secret code,
>one that has defied the efforts of the world's greatest spy-masters and
>crypto-fiends to crack for countless centuries (or at least since 1962 or
>so).  It goes like this:

>
>  I have reason to believe that the Discordian secret code has been

>(Or is it, "Loose lips sink Golden Apple Corps"?  I'm never sure...). 
>Well, it was worse than loose lips.  It is my suspiscion that some
>traitorous Discordian actually gave the code to the NSA.
>

>scheme for a Discordian Secret Code.  Here's are some alternate schemes I
>had for encoding messages:
>
>  * Implosion Method.  Write message on lightbulb.  Implode lightbulb. 
>Recipient then reverses time continuum and grabs pre-imploded lightbulb
>from alternate timeline, reads message, and tosses back for implosion
>before anybody notices.
>  Advantages:  NSA Clipper plans (oddly enough) do not extend as far as
>including key/escrow chips in all time travel devices.
>  Disadvantages:  Useless against the Great Race of Yith.
>
>  * St. Gulik Method.   Write the message in radioactive ink on box paste
>and feed to specially trained homing cockroaches.  Release the homing
>cockroaches to skitter home.  Reassemble message from roach entrails.
>  Advantages:  Enemy cryptographers don't like touching roaches.
>  Disadvantages:  Kills the roaches; difficult to train them to go home.
>
>  * O'Leary's Cow Method.   Write message on paper and burn to ashes. 
>Send ashes to recipient.
>  Advantages:  No way for enemy to decode message.
>  Disadvantages:  No way for recipient to decode message.
>
>  * Formless Spawn Method.   Write message on outer surface of trained
>Shoggoth in really strong permanent ink.  As Shoggoth moves, message will
>be scrambled on its surface.  With the proper command word, recipient can
>command shoggoth to assume original form(lessness), descrambling the
>message.
>  Advantages:  Message devours any enemy crytographer who tries to decode it.
>  Disadvantages:  No good if recipient fails sanity check.
>
>
>  Any other suggestions for good encryption schemes would be welcome...
>I'm beginning to feel insecure already, as well as a little on the insane
>side (you try training a shoggoth to act as your message-pod...)
