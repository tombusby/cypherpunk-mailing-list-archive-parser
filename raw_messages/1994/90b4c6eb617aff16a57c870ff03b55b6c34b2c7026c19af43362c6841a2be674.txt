TWO UPDATES MAKE FOR DIGITAL SIGNATURES IN EMAIL
================================================

DIGITAL SIGNATURES
- ------------------
One of the real up-and-coming uses of encryption technology is for
applying digital ``signatures'' to various electronic documents. Such
signatures are not forgeable and guarantee that a document originates
with its author. If Dartmouth College had such a system in place
recently, a message impersonating a faculty member announcing the
cancellation of an exam might have been avoided. Digital signatures can
also be used to detect viruses before infected files execute.

Up to now, however, digitally signing documents has not been an easy
task. The first hurdle has been an inability to export the technology
overseas, making it virtually impossible to standardize on a signature
method. Secondly, it has been difficult to license the technology
patents involved.

The use of a freeware software utility called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
has caused some difficulties as well. Since PGP has already found its
way overseas and has gained some popularity, in particular because US
digital signature software has not been easily exportable. In the United
States, many organizations are reluctant to use PGP because of its
questionable patent status. In addition, its author, Phil Zimmermann, is
under investigation for possible export violations. These problems have
kept organizations from adopting PGP as a standard.

Two recent announcements have significantly changed things.

The first announcement is the release of two new versions of RIPEM, one
called RIPEM, the other called RIPEM/SIG. RIPEM is a free version of the
Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) standard implemented by Mark
Riordan of Michigan State University. RIPEM/SIG is a subset of RIPEM
that allows users to digitally sign their e-mail documents but does not
allow encryption or decryption.

What is significant about this announcement is that Riordan--in
cooperation with RSA Data Security, Inc--has received a ``commodities
jurisdiction'' ruling which allows free and legal export of
non-encrypting RIPEM/SIG outside of the US. This means both US and
overseas users can now standardize on a single set of software, instead
of only working with RIPEM inside the US and PGP outside.

This release also addresses some of the complaints of PGP users: both
RIPEM and RIPEM/SIG support a non-hierarchical trust model similar to
PGP, and for US users the non-exportable version of RIPEM provides full
triple-DES privacy. Even though the triple-DES RIPEM may not be
exportable, Riordan is working with authors of independently developed
PEM applications in other countries with the goal of 100%
interoperability in a version 2.0 of RIPEM. Until that time, since
RIPEM/SIG is free and exportable, users could send a non-US or Canadian
user both RIPEM/SIG and the message to be authenticated.

The second announcement is from RSA Data Security, Inc. for the 2.0
version of RSAREF. RSAREF is a source code cryptographic toolkit
designed specifically for writing PEM applications as well other
fundamental cryptographic and digital signature tools. In fact,
RIPEM is based on the RSAREF source code.

What is most significant about this new RSAREF is that RSA Data Security
has changed its license to make RSAREF much more accessible to both
corporations and commercial and non-commercial developers. Freeware
products (i.e., software where no fee other than media or bandwidth cost
is requested) can use the RSAREF toolkit provided that the public has
access to the product's source code.

Though a new license agreement has not been finalized, I've been told by
RSA that they will grant a royalty-free license for shareware products
for up to $10,000 worth of gross annual sales if the shareware source
code is available and the developers do not charge more than $50 a
copy.

Even if you are a commercial developer, I know from personal experience
that RSA can be quite reasonable about licensing. They want this base
level of technology adopted as widely as possible--just make RSA a
reasonable offer and I think they'll take it.

RIPEM and RIPEM/SIG are also beneficiaries of this new RSAREF license,
which means that US companies can have privacy and authentication free
of hassles from patent holders and export cops.


MORE ON RIPEM/SIG
- -----------------
The press release on RIPEM/SIG from Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>
is at:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/posting

If you are a US or Canadian citizen, you can request an account for
access to the full non-exportable RIPEM. Information on how to get
access is at:

        ftp://guest.mu5k2d55:@ripem.msu.edu//pub/crypt/GETTING_ACCESS

The binary files for the exportable RIPEM/SIG can be found in the
directory:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/

RSAREF/SIG Files available today are:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-68030-macintosh-commandline-1.2a.sit.hqx

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-80x86-dos-vanilla-1.2a.exe

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-hppa-hpux9.01-1.2a

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-ibm-rs6000-aix3.2-1.2a

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-sparc-sunos4.1.1-1.2a

There does not seem to be separate documentation for RIPEM/SIG yet, so
I guess you have to use the documentation for RIPEM 1.2a:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripem.man
        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemusr.doc
        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemusr.txt

A current list of RIPEM public keys is at:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/pubkeys.txt

There is an electronic-mail users group list PEM-DEV for discussions
related to the development and deployment of Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)
systems. Contributions to the list should be sent to
``pem-dev@tis.com''. Administrivia, e.g., additions to or deletions from
the list should be sent to ``pem-dev-request@tis.com''.

The Internet Multicasting Service <carl@radio.com> is now beginning to
stamp all of their text files with RSA/RIPEM digital signatures.  You
can find their public key through a finger request to town.hall.org. For
examples of stamped files, look at:

    ftp://town.hall.org/edgar/docs/


MORE ON RSAREF 2.0
- ------------------
Remember, even though you can use RSAREF to create exportable,
non-encryption based digital signature software, the source code to
RSAREF is not exportable itself, as it can do encryption. It is only
available to US and Canadian citizens.

The press release on RSAREF from Jim Bidzos <jim@chirality.rsa.com> is
at:

        ftp://rsa.com//pub/RIPEM_SIG_announce.txt

Information on what RSAREF is all about and what are the license terms
are located at:

        ftp://rsa.com/rsaref/info.reply
        ftp://rsa.com/rsaref/license.txt

To get access to a time dependent directory (it changes every few
minutes) you will need to read the document:

        ftp://rsa.com/rsaref/README

If you agree to it's terms, take the directory mentioned there and
substitute it for the checksum in the directory ``U.S.-only 7c04e6''.

The compressed tar archive of RSAREF is at (remember to change the time
dependent directory!):

        ftp://rsa.com/rsaref/dist/U.S.-only-7c04e6/rsaref.tar.Z

The ZIP archive of RSAREF is at (remember to change the time dependent
directory!):

        ftp://rsa.com/rsaref/dist/U.S.-only-7c04e6/rsaref.zip

You can also get the RSAREF via email by reading the RSAREF license
agreement and sending the following message to
<rsaref-administrator@rsa.com> (If your electronic mail address is
located in Canada, please also send RSA your full name and mailing
address; they'll need it to complete a Department of State export
declaration):

     I acknowledge that I have read the RSAREF Program License
     Agreement and understand and agree to be bound by its terms and
     conditions, including without limitation its restrictions on
     foreign reshipment of the Program and information related to the
     Program. The electronic mail address to which I am requesting
     that the program be transmitted is located in the United States
     of America or Canada and I am an United States citizen, a Canadian
     citizen, or a permanent resident of the United States. The RSAREF
     Program License Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement
     between RSA Laboratories and me relating to the Program, and
     supersedes any proposal or prior agreement, oral or written, and
     any other communications between RSA Laboratories and me relating
     to the Program.

RSA Laboratories maintains an electronic-mail users group
<rsaref-users@rsa.com> for discussions on RSAREF applications, bug
fixes, etc. To join the users group, send electronic mail to
<rsaref-users-request@rsa.com>.
