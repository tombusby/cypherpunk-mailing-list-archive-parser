I agree with both conjectures.

There is a slight difference between what Conjecture A predicts and
this statement.  Conjecture A predicts that as b, the number of bets,
goes to infinity the fraction of bets won will approach C, the
probability that the church will win a single trial.

> Where could one disagree with this interpretation of the model?

You should think about what you mean by "fraction of money".  I think
there is a seductive error here.  In one sense, we mean the amount of
money placed on bets, but we also mean the actual bank notes in play.
These concepts address two different things.  Whether or not banknotes
are recycled by the parishioners will not affect the church's
winnings.

Each parishioner has a high probability of losing their savings and a
low probability of winning everything owned by the church.  It is
possible for any single parishioner to win everything, but it is
unlikely.

The player needs to be lucky.

Let's say the church's assets are H dollars.  In order for it to lose
everything, it has to have a series of bets whose sum is a negative
value less than -H.  This series has a beginning - the point at which
the church's assets dropped below H and moved down to 0.  If
parishioners play until they win or are broke, the player who took the
church below H will be the same player who wins everything.  (I am
assuming fixed size bets, but the conclusions can be generalized.)

This player wins because he or she was fortunate enough to place the
first bet in the series.  Having more capital means that more bets can
be placed.  That increases the probability of placing the first bet in
the winning series, but does not affect the odds of the church losing
everything.

I found it interesting.  Your message was written clearly.

I've seen this question and similar ones come up again and again in
discussions of gambling, trading, and insurance.  It would be nice if
having a large body of capital would allow one to "make money off the
noise", but it isn't so.

It has been observed that small traders in the futures markets tend to
lose money to large traders.  One way this has been explained is that
the large traders outlast the small traders with their larger capital
and that is how they make money.  I think a more likely explanation is
that the large traders tend to make good trades.
