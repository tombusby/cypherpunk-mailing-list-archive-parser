I got a lot of complaints today about copies of Tim's old "Blacknet" posting
being sent to inappropriate groups:

I set up a log file for "blacknet" postings, and got this:

It seems Larry is sending this posting to lots of inappropriate groups
using several different mail-to-news gateways.  This is a good way to
get remailers shut down, which may be his ultimate goal.

I call upon remailer operators to block incoming messages from Detweiler's
known aliases.  Thos using the slocal-based "cypherpunks" remailer perl
scripts can add the following lines near the front of their maildelivery
files.

# Filter Detweiler
From ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu  file  ?  /dev/null
From 	an12070@anon.penet.fi  		 file  ?  /dev/null
From 	detweile			 file  ?  /dev/null

Unless his access to the remailer network is blocked, he will be able to
continue to abuse the system until it gets shut down.

The alternative would be to block my remailer's access to all known
mail-to-news gateways, but I am reluctant to take that step because of
the loss of this ability for those who legitimately need it.  If his abuse
keeps up, though, that may be the only choice left.
