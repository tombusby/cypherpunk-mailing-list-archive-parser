So? Lots of military bases are near urban areas. 

I haven't seen this report before, but my hunch is that the plan is to
use the large dirigible hangars (some of the largest buildings in the
world, built in the 1920s and 30s) for the rappelling exerices. Just a
hunch.

In any case, since there aren't many other tall buildings around here
likely to be occupied in the Coming Crisis (tm) by Cypherpunk
Criminals (tm) and other CyberTerrorists (tm), I hardly think there's
a correlation between where this merry band of Special Forces guys
does their training and where, if anyplace, they get deployed. Do you
think there's a correlation?

In any case, guys rappelling down buildings is the least of our
reasons for paranoia.
