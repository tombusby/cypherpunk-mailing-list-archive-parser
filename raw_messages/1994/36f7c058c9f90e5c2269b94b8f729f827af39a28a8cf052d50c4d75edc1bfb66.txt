I appreciate your feedback. From what I have read of Hawkings and others work
I would have to disagree w/ your statements that a black hole is equated w/
the event horizon. In every text (incl. the Hawkings book from the 70's on
the subject) to makes a clear distinction.

Several years ago (around '90) there was a whole raft of work dealing w/ the 
event horizon and the consensus that I got was that the event horizon was 
a fractal. Perhaps you would site some references where this theory is not
accepted and a argumetn as to why it fails?

What I am saying as far as QED/QCD is that w/o discussing both then the actions
of electrons and photons are not quantum mechanical in the sense that they
require statistical terms to describe their behaviour. Nowhere in Maxwells 
Equations is there a statistical term. If you know of a hole in the equations
please let me know of it. I am not aware of any behaviour of electrons/photons
which are not covered by these equations until hadrons are introduced.
