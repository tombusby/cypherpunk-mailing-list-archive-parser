I haven't been able to keep up with all of the Stego discussion, but on
pictures with few colors and a large amount of a small number of
colors (like cartoons, etc. with a backround), you could use the
unused color table entries.  You set these to be the same colors as
the correspondingly largest used colors and use them when juxtaposed
with their color.

Won't compress as well of course, but the picture is identical.
Multiple color entries at the same setting could be used to encode
more bits.  (0=1=2=3 gives 2 bits info).

You then leave the least used colors alone.

More easily detectable I suppose though since multiple color settings
were the same.  One way around that is to make them just a shade off,
which wouldn't change the actual color much.
