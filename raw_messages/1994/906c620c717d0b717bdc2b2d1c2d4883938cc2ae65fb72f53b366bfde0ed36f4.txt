Your sources are mostly limited.

Therefore none exists.

I provided several examples of how money laundering is applied to 
COMINT/SIGINT operations.  You chose to ignore them.

No, it does not.
The logistics are an executive function.  How to implement the program, 
how to introduce it to the public etc.  If the NSA was behind this, you 
will be able to explain why the press release was done through the White 
House.

No I would not.
I would say that it is designed to maintain the COMINT/SIGINT ability 
domestically and abroad.  Wiretapping is a law enforcement concern 
handled by the FBI.  You'll be looking for the Digital Telephony Bill.

You now resort to Sternlight type tactics.  Change your assertion to fit 
the mood.  If anything the NSA may design technologies or integrate 
existing technologies that may have Digital Cash applications.  Asserting 
that they will be the institution primarily responsible for implementing 
nationwide digital cash flies in the face of history and theory.

Clipper and the design thereof is entirely within the bounds of the NSA 
mission.  I have outlined it for you three times.

You refer to domestic surveillance abuses here and seem to forget that 
four paragraphs ago you were asserting there is no evidence of such 
activity.  Take your Lithium please.

You seem to propose that all ongoing projects are scrapped in 
intelligence agencies when a new administration takes the reigns.

Delegating the public relations to the vice president is an insulating 
tactic.  Again, read some Political Science, then return.

More like:
The NSA announced some new technology and potential applications.  The 
Bush administration directed further work to be done, and some general 
guidelines, the Clinton administration continued the work and fast 
tracked the program in conjunction with the current frenzy over 
Superhighways.

No it is the current administration using the NSA to support a program 
that they feel is dying.  It is the current administration that has no 
idea how to properly utilize intelligence agencies.  Anyone who has 
studied or practiced intelligence will tell you that one of the major 
problems in the field is getting the leadership to listen.  Asserting the 
intelligence is in control of the situation is out of hand.

I have a great deal of faith in the NSA.  I state this without concern.
I also have a great deal of respect for intelligence in general and I am 
of a real belief that intelligence has a place in modern society.  
Intelligence is always doing stupid things, no question about it, but 
usually it is because POLITICS tries to manipulate intelligence and push 
square pegs through round holes.  The NSA is having it's arm twisted to 
play public relations on this.

Again, this is a stark departure from your original assertion.
You seem to attribute to the NSA a desire for active regulation.

All of them.  Any President who uses intelligence knows that money has to 
be laundered.  You think the bay of pigs was done through the U.S. Treasury?
Have I mared the image of your liberal hero President of the era because 
I suggest he might have known about money laundering by the intelligence 
agencies?  Wake up and smell the coffee.  Open your door and look around.

Takes money to make money tmp.
This wont last long if the executive takes away funding.
Are you asserting the NSA and the CIA and Military intelligence operate 
without the authority of the President on such a large scale as to 
include the development of secure cash systems for domestic use?

I refuse to argue this point any longer.  NSA does not make policy.

The NSA does not make export policy, only adds to the list of restricted 
items.  How many time must I repeat this?

I suppose I'm not a very good Sternlight.

These are not the goals, neither are they contradictory.

No, that would be the individuals involved in the policy decisions.
But I do have a great deal of respect for the Office of the Presidency.

Yes, I do believe in the ability of the intelligence agencies under the 
direction of a well organized and knowing executive to accomplish much good.
Such is not the case today.

Again, it should not be the NSA who is involved in the publicity.

Were this done correctly it would have been handled such:
(Assuming the administration was so bold as to attempt such an operation 
in the domestic sphere which is part of the reason the initiative is such 
a clusterfuck)

1>  Establish front technology research company.
2>  Announce breakthrough development through company (Clipper)
3>  Pass down NSA approval of the process and discuss NSA involvement in 
the TECHNOLOGY development without fanfare, and with minimal connection 
to NSA.
4>  Create administrative agency to insulate President and Congress from 
repercussions (NIST)
5>  Implement Clipper with NIST and no further NSA involvement.

Unfortunately the executive branch got it wrong in planning to use the 
NSA as a PR entity.

tmp: 

You betray your ignorance yet again.

You battle over the same small points, argue details, and contradict 
yourself in theory repeatedly in your messages.  You cite one source and 
refuse to provide any real backup or any theoretical basis for your 
assertions that will survive a raindrop.

It is clear that your experience in both intelligence and finance is 
limited if existent.

It is clear that you have convinced yourself of an outcome and will 
continue to create facts and theory from whole cloth to support them.

It is clear that you are not open to intellectual discussion.

Therefore I refuse to continue.  Considering the lack of intellectual 
content in your last post, this response was a gift.  Don't expect 
another one.  You have extracted quite enough education at my expense.

I suggest you read up on intelligence agencies.  Consider taking some 
undergraduate level classes in intelligence and then moving to the 
graduate level.  Most of all, I suggest that you, in future, open your mind.
