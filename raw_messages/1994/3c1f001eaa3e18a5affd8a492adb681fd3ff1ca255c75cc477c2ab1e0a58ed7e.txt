The tradeoff is between number of characters needed (length of passphrase)
and diversity of character set. I'd probably have better luck with the
mnemonic if I didn't have to fit in a whole string of %*$@!, but that
should probably be a user setting.

Another possibility: have a dictionary of different parts of speech and
assemble them in order. For a short example, each passphrase could be in an
order such as:

Article adjective modifier noun verb article adjective modifier noun.

Our favorite would fit: The quick brown fox jumps over the very lazy dog.

This looses entropy (Mallet knows the order, and probably the dictionaries)
and so you would want either a longer sentence or some other modification,
like random--not decided by the person--capitalization or character
substitution. Or have two sentences: The quick brown fox jumps over the
very lazy dog; a lovely ermine glove fits into the hazy slumping bucket.

Figure thirteen bits each with dictionaries of ten thousand each
adjectives, modifiers, nouns, and verbs--your final dictionary would be 40
thousand words, total; you'd need about ten words to get 128 bits. Make
that two shorter--eight word--sentences, restricted to easy-to-remember
orderings, and you've more than made up for whatever entropy was lost in
having a known structure.

Umph. I think I need to start making time to write code, if I want to see
this work.
