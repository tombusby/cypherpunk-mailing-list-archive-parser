I've been following the digital money issues here for quite some time,
and I do not understand this distinction at all. Sandy said essentially the
same thing in different words, and that too was beyond me.

Except for tangible money (i.e. 99.99% pure gold coins) I don't see that
any money is anything other than a mutially agreed upon way of moving
"barter tokens" between folks. Sometime the government (or Fed) can define
the true value of the barter tokens, and othertimes their attempts fail.
When the attempt fail, the usual course is to have a "devaluation" that
reflects market realities.

I don't see how digital money is fundamentally different than
private bank notes that were common in the US in the last century. They are
good if they are accepted, and useless if not.

If this is really a critical distinction, since I don't see it, I'd
appreciate a more concrete explaination.

Thanks
Pat
