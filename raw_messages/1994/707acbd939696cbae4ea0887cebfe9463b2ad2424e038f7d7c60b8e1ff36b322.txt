On the nose.

I'll probably do just that. First thought, subject to revision: hash the
name, feed it to DES with the output of a deterministic RNG (need not be
secure, but the slower the better--BBS? (not that BBS is incesure)) as the
key; repeat as needed. Hmmm...perhaps I'll adapt an earlier idea of mine:
split the hash into two parts, a and b, and compute (a^(1/b))-1, and use
some or all bits after the leading zeros.

Nice idea, but there's neither the available resources to do that, nor, I
think, the desire to beat up on careless users. Berzerk suggests a 0.1 S/N
ratio (and in an earlier note a couple useable algorithms for the multiple
encryption process); that would not be practical for any decent sized
database, and I might have 100K or so people to deal with. But I almost
certainly will mix in at least some random padding. I imagine that the
database will always be the same length, even as people are added and/or
removed with time. And the records, of course, will be premuted randomly.

Then here's a suggestion for you: develop some other primitives, like
rolling dice, and you could implement just about any other game you like.
Monopoly would need (aside from licensing issues) the dice, two decks of
special cards, and some ecash. (Surely MM used as Monopoly Money isn't
subversive? After all, it's teaching our young 'uns to be good
capitalists.) Scrabble would need a deck of cards, each of which contains
only a letter, with many duplicates. Trivial Pursiut is just a huge deck of
cards; they'd probably be index positions to the database of questions, so
special editions are just a file switch away.

These are among the most popular games in the US, and probalby abroad.
Build your primitives right, and these games are as simple as specifing
paramaters (how many sides to the dice, what info the cards contain, etc.).
And maybe you could license the stuff, each and every independent game, to
the current owners of the games that aren't PD.

So how about becomming "kb, the Kent who digitized the American family evening"?

Go for it! And drop me a line when you want beta testers (sometime Thursday?).
