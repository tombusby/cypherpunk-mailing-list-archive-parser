| "Derivatives" mean secondary financial instruments, based on ("derived
| from") things like stocks, bonds, and real estate. Things like futures
| markets, "baskets" of other instruments, etc. These started, it may be
| argued, in the trading pits of Chicago, but have now spread around the
| world. I think I recall reading (in "Time"'s cover story last week on
| derivatives and quants, ironically enough--the Wall Street nerd with
| the "messy room" has replaced the hacker as the Number One Threat to
| Civilization) that $ 4 Trillion in derivatives trades _daily_.
|
| "Quants," closely related to "rocket scientists," are those who use
| math and statistics for investment purposes. Short for "quantitative."
|
| I urge all Cypherpunks who can afford to do so to subscribe to "The
| Economist." It's filled with good, incisive articles, including the
| best treatments of breaking science and technology stories in any
| general magazine. Shoot your t.v., maybe, but don't let your
| subsription lapse. Available also on newstands, whence information on
| subscribing may be found (read the mag long enough, and you too will
| speak in terms of "whence").

The derivatives market is a very dangerous place also. In yesterdays 
financial section here in Seattle there was an article about how 
Proctor and Gamble is reporting a loss of over $100 million in the 
mortgage derivative market. Also in RISKS Digest 15.75 there is an 
article with the subject ' God Grants Granite Gift to RISKS Punsters' 
that talks about a company losing $600 million over the period of 
several weeks in the deriviative market.
