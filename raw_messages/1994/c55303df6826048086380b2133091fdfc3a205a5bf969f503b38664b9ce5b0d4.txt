It depends on the size of the noise.  If the noise could be a simple 
4-6char number(compressed name, with pointer to trash adresses or real 
mismatched ones), giving a 16 char hash and the rest of the information was 
much larger, say 100chars, a signal to noise of 1 would only be a 15% ish 
increse in size, and this improves if you have more data.
