Terms are being used loosely.  I was responding to a critique of RemailerNet
v0.1 (RN0.1).  In this systems messages are packetized and the packets
routed independently, with the packets reassembled into messages at the
'destination gateway'.	User control of packet-level routing would
weaken the system.  RN0.2 permits the user to nest messages and to direct
messages to gateways as destinations.  This means that messages may be
bounced around in the system, adding some additional security.	So the
user can control chaining/routing at the message level, but not at the
packet level.
