I am interested in the binaries are say <20K, otherwise there is too much
disassembly required.....

That'd be WAY mega spinach cool. I have developed an extreme dislike for
ARJ and would really like to write a fully featured faster ARJ program
mainly because the one I have (2.41a) is so crippled and [IMAO] the author
is totally undeserving a single cent.

P.S. These opinions are mine. If they offend then feel free to kill-file me,
     otherwise - tough!
