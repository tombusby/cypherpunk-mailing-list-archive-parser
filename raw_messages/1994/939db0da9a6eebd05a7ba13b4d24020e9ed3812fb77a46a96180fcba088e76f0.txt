I have seen no substantive refutation of the points I made in my
original post there, BTW, indeed no "discussion" of the _issues_ at all.
The only reason it's a "calm discussion" is that the moderator is
apparently shortstopping most effective pro-anon posts to the list.  He
admits to stopping mine and Cc:ed posts I've received netmail do not
show up on the group.

In short, what you see on the group appears to be what he wants you to
see and is not reflective of the actual traffic.  Ingenious, huh?

If you have an actual, substantive objection to the points I raised in
my original post, I'd be pleased to read them.  If you missed it on the
first time around, I'll send it to you again.  So far only _one_
anti-anon correspondent has actually challenged one of my points on a
technical matter, but he's factually mistaken.  I do applaud him for at
least facing the questions on their merits, though.
