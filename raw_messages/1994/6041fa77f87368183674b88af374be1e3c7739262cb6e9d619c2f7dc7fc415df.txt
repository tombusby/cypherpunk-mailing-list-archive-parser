Allow me to clear up a major misconception here, which I initially
shared. According to Matt, the cleartext of the session key and the IV
are both components that go into the checksum. Therefore, the remote
EES unit CAN determine that you've spoofed them if you attempt a
shortcut like reusing a LEAF generated by another unit. You really
have to test lots of pseudoLEAFs against a test unit that you've
handed a session key to.

Correct. However, remember that it tests the checksum against an IV
and session key.

"It depends". Diffie-Hellman, prearrangement, via a public key
mediated exchange, or anything else that seams reasonable.

See above -- the problem is that of finding a LEAF with a proper
checksum that corresponds to the session key.
