This text is taken almost verbatim from CERT Advisory CA-92:19.  The idea
behind it is to protect systems operators from lawsuits if they monitor the
keystrokes of a hacker breaking into their system.  It's quoted in Cheswick
and Bellovin's _Firewalls_and_Internet_Security_ (a totally cool book BTW).

They quote from the case _United States_v._Seidlitz_ 589 F.2d 152 (4th Cir.
1978) where the defendant claimed that keystroke monitoring of his attempt
to break into OSI's computer constituted an illegal wiretap.  The judge
blew him off, of course.

If you're worried that this boiler plate legalese gives them carte blanche
to listen in on your IRC sessions on #bondage, then forget it.  It
(_probably_) doesn't.
