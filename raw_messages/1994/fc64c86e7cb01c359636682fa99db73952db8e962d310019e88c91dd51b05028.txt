...FCC apparently decides that per-line blocking should be prohibited 
since people might forget to unblock it when calling 911.

John Levine says,

To me the question is, why can't the phone company provide options
for blocking-on-all-but-911-calls, and unlisted-except-for-911?
More precisely, why can't the FCC allow for this simple possibility?

The reasoning seems to be, "since we can't understand why 
people want this, we must prohibit its even being an option:"

"...We find" it "is not the best... thus, carriers may not offer" it.
What about what the customers and consumer groups have found and fought
for?  What is wrong with letting this be decided on a regional, if not
provider, if not local, if not personal level?  Why must FCC impose least-
common-denominator reduction of services?
