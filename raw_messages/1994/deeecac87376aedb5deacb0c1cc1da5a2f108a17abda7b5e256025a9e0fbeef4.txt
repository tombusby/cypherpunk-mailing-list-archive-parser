  Oh, for instance, say liability to the banks who's electronic fund
transfers were stolen or forged.  But yeah, my understanding was that
IBM wouldn't release the cipher for general consumption unless some
Gov't would 'standardize' it and take the liability heat.

  Even the smaller 56 bit key was IBM's idea?  Why!??!?  Weren't they
in the business of making a _strong_ cipher?
