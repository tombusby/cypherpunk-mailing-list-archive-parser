This was the address in the death threat:

Looks like a sendmail hack. 
Sendmail at most sites recognize the site you telnet to port 25 from even
if you explicitly provide another one through 'helo'. So while you can forge 
the From: line, it will appear as if the mail came from your *real* site before
it got to the final site. The only site I know of where you can telnet to port
25 and type 'helo this.is.not.my.site' and have it accepted is MindVox, 
phantom.com. This was a while ago, and I haven't searched very hard for similar
sites.

If it was sent through remailers the article would probably have mentioned it.
They make much better evil hacker news than just a 'purported' address.
