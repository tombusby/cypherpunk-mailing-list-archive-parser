Ben, ix-nay on the omb-bay talk! I asked you not to discuss these
things on open channels. (But, yes, I did just hear about the BND's
seizure of the shipment...our Polish friends are getting sloppy.)

On the "Tommy the Tourist" tag lines. To use a netticism, "<shrug>."

The modern Net and the modern NSA will not be fooled for any
significant amount of time by such naughty words. In fact, I'm sure
they now have a set of filters for ignoring such blatant bait.

As all readers of Ludlum, Deighton, and Forsythe know, messages would
be phrased as things like "Order received, bill to follow," if not in
even more obscure code or enciphered. (Enciphering arouses suspicion,
of course, so codes are more likely.)
