	    SUN FEDERAL FILES AGENCY PROTEST 
	 WITH THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTING OFFICE

Company Challenges "Round Two" of the NSA-HPW2 Workstation Procurement

VIENNA, Virg. -- January 12, 1994 -- On Jan. 7, Sun Microsystems
Federal, Inc., the original awardee of the National Security Agency
(NSA) HPW2 (High Performance Workstation) contract, filed a formal
protest with the Government Accounting Office (GAO) challenging the
rebid of the procurement. It is Sun Federal's contention that the
Maryland Procurement Office (MPO) has violated Federal Acquisition
Regulations (FAR) by substantially changing the requirements of the
original solicitation. The company is asking the GAO to direct the MPO
to cancel this solicitation and issue a new specification based on
current requirements.

Sun Microsystems Federal, Inc., is the leading vendor of open
client-server computing solutions to the government. It is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Sun Microsystems, Inc., with headquarters in
Milpitas, Calif.
