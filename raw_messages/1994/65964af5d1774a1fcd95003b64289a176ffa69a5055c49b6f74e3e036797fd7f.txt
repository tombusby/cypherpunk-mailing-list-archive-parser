You might try to make contact with Romana Machado <romana@apple.com>.
According to her home page
(http://www.mps.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/hpp?romanaHQ.html):
	Software engineer, author, cryptoanarchist, model, "hot-blooded	 
	capitalist", I have been featured in Wired and Boing Boing for Stego,
	a crypto tool for the Macintosh, and for being a Very Extropian 
	Person. I work in the Newton group at Apple Computer . 

- - From a linked page (http://www.nitv.net/homes/mech/Romana/stego.html):
	Stego was favorably reviewed by Sandy Sandfort in the March 1994 issue
	of Wired and the March 1994 issue of Boing Boing.

...so perhaps Sandy can correct me if this is a bum steer.  I ran across her
home page near the end of a long WWW safari which passed through some utterly
non-crypto-related links.
