Indeed, you have made it quite clear that you don't seem to care what 
leaks are attributed to you.

I don't intend to flame you, nor to begin a flame war.  I questioned your 
methods, and you respond with nothing but smoke.  You outline some broad 
goals but advance no theories about how they might be accomplished by 
your immediate actions except admitting that the individual can't affect 
much.

Your approach puzzles me.  I will, however, never advance the suggestion 
that you not participate.  I wouldn't bother to reply if you didn't seem 
worth the effort.  This is why I stopped bickering with tmp@netcom.com.

You seem too devoted to your cause to be dissuaded by me.  What is one to 
infer about your response to more compelling pressures?

This from a "questionable" statured military type with three 
self-appointed SSN's?

I have always found civilian intelligence more agreeable.  Less regimented.
Less reactionary.  Less worry with the indoctrination of training.

I'm afraid personal attacks deserve personal attacks.

In addition, I question your analysis of the NSA security manual and its 
potential harm.  I might add that I think it suggests a poor CI ability, 
not a well defined one as you would have us believe.  To a person with 
your training, the damage of the manual should be clear to you.
If I'm wrong than Military Intelligence really needs some work indeed.
Back to the Walker days in the Navy?

I believe that what your doing is an key part of cypherpunks, 
discussing, absorbing, sharpening.  It's the DORK39's who are disruptive.
Just try not to be so judgemental on a personal level and stick to the 
argument.  You know nothing of me nor my education or experience, don't 
pretend to by citing some off the wall remark about CI training in the 
hopes that it might impress the less informed readers.
