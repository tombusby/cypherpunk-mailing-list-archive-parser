"Meanwhile, there are some excellent aftermarket sports kits for 'Le

blow away the original springs!  Of course some assembly is required...."

I said before, I couldn't figure out who had been at the table for the 
intellectual property interests when the 2.5 thing was negotiated, but 
I'd like to go up against her.  We all knew it changed nothing, and no one 
could figure out what PKP was up to.

Now its clear they weren't super clever like I first feared, but just really 
slow and stupid.  This is a sad last minute attempt to plug the dam with a 
golf tea after the town has already been lost.

Now you want to tell me that it was these same people who all of a sudden 
got hard nosed and bossed around the developers with some magic cripple-it-all
compromise when, not only is the cat out of the bag, but they 
also have little, or questionable legal grounds?  I guess they switched law 
firms eh?  Or maybe it is the same idiots all over again.

And an idiot's version of it too.  I can't help but picture "Baldric" of 
"Black Adder" fame.  "Fear not my lord, for *I* have a cunning plan...."

Won what?  I won when I got PGP 2.3a.  Who wins at this game where 
keyservers are unfriendly, keys are limited, international versions are 
"illegal" (still), and upgrade is basically "forced" not because the 
software I have on my computer now is obsolete, but because it ISN'T?  
What the hell is that?

We won.  Hah!  Too bloody much.

You noticed this did you?
Negotiated is a colorful verb here.  VERY colorful.

I don't know enough about the situation to know whether to support PRZ or 
not.  Why?  

Because no one has been told enough.

The key servers vanish quickly but silently like the extras in some B 
horror flick.  Everyone else stands around by the campfire saying "Hey, 
where did Bob and Sarah go, and where's that firewood they were supposed 
to bring back?  Where'd they get that chain saw I heard earlier and why 
did Sarah keep screaming?  Oh well, let's wait and see if they come 
back.  Even better, Fred, why don't you try and get some wood and see where 
they went?"

Everytime someone objects or asks the admins for some answer, all we get 
is a press release with more restrictions imposed than the last 
over-the-barrel beating.


This is victory?

Give me defeat so I can go home and use 2.3a.
