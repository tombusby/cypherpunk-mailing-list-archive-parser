No, I can't think of a fix, although your idea at the bottom might be
workable in some form.

You would want some confirmation that you got the key you requested.  The
broadcasted key list could be updated to show which ones have been
reserved already, marked with a "nonce" (a one-time use secret random
number you sent with your request) to show who reserved them.  In this
case you might not even need to request a specific one, just ask for one
to be assigned to you and then look and see which one you got.  Of course
this assumes a broadcast mechanism but perhaps this is tolerable if there
aren't too many remailers.

You'd have to watch out for attackers who constantly ping the pigeonhole
address and try to see which messages leave the remailer network in a
correlated way.

Yes, that is a good idea.  Many of the existing remailers are also
written in perl (calling PGP for decryption) but not much work has been
done to improve them in this way.  I think there is recognition that the
biggest security improvement would come with message quantizing (and not
passing subject lines through!) and until we have that the rest is
pretty pointless.

I have not looked at the Shade source.  Here is the posting I made to
cypherpunks on Krawczyk's method.  I wasn't very well organized but if
you read through to the end you may be able to get the gist of it:

This is true, but you said you are talking about things that can be done
today, and today Usenet already has a pool of probably a million users.
That is plenty of security.  The problem is if everyone starts using it
for their replies, but that won't be more than a drop in the bucket for a
long time.

This is an interesting idea.  It is sort of like broadcast except you
would be reducing the bandwidth requirements by only sending certain
information to each user.  One way to formalize it would be to say that
you have two datasets, D1 and D2.  These get combined into D12 = f(D1,D2)
for some combinging function f.  Then we ask whether there is a g(D12)
which allows reconstruction of just D1 or D2 in such a way that we can't
tell which one it will get just from knowing f and g.  Plus, g must
output data which is no larger than D1 or D2.

In this strict form I don't think it can be done, because you could
change D1 and see if g(D12) changed.  If it did, then it was getting D1,
and if it didn't, it was getting D2.  However if we let g be a little
bigger then perhaps it wouldn't be so clear.  I don't know...

Again, users may not be willing to live with it since they have an
alternative right now in usenet.
