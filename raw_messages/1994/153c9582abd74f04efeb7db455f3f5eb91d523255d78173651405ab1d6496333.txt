Ah.  Now I see why Matthew was forging mail from my site.  Thanks for
your concern Matthew, but the mail was indeed from me, and pizzabox is
quite secure since I run home-brew fingerwarz and pidentwarz daemons.

I'll pgp-sign this confirmation just to keep everyone happy.  Yes, I
have unsubscribed from cypherpunks because I don't want to be part of
a list which is advertised elsewhere on the net as being sympathetic
to people who don't want their tax money going to coloured people.
If he'd said he didn't want his tax money going to unemployed people
or poor people, I could have understood his viewpoint (though not
sypmathised with it), but to explicitly single out coloured people
in a posting soliciting like-minded people for cypherpunks tells me
its time to move on.

And as for doug@netcom's rant, I'm not even going to dignify it with
an answer.

: only hold him off until he can find another SMTP port to spoof from.

PS Matthew - I'll mail the andrew.cmu.edu postmaster and tell him it was
a misunderstanding.
