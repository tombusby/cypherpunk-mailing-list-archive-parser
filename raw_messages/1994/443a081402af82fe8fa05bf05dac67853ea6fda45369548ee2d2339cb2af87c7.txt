Do you think your fastidious compliance with the law will keep them from 
branding you a criminal, anyway?  Wake up.

The whole purpose of wide-spread availability and use of strong crypto is 
to what "others" say or think, irrelevant.  Strong crypto means never 
having to say you're sorry.

The "them" was that of the original writer (you?), which I took to mean 
the government.  In the context of my statement, either will serve.  The 
"Smith & Wesson" statement was offered as a (humorous?) analogy.  In 
poker four-of-a-kind is a good hand only as long as everyone plays by the 
rules.  When force enters the picture, the rules--as the president's 
shills would say--"are no longer operative."

The essence of government is guns, not laws.  Get it?
