I think I'm a bit confused. Your first post suggested that I was ignoring
an important part of the market, and I acknowledge that this was delibrate.

Now you seem to be arguing that the paranoia that I addressed in my
fourth question is justified. I'd like more backup for this, as
all I have is speculation at this point. I don't know if it is paranoia or
prudence.

Yes, if you are running DOS/Windows, you can address the world. Sigh.
And lots of other/better OS fix this, but they haven't got the market
penetration. So I'm back to addressing lots of folks, or a few
ones with real computers and real operating systems. I'd rather not
degrade into that religion, I started with TOPS-10 and moved to Tenex...

The problem with the serial port dongles are:

1) while parallel port dongels are known technology, making it work
on a serial port is more problematical.

2) Most PC serial ports are junk. Getting reliable data rates above
2400 baud is non-trivial for low end PCs. If I could claim that the
users had to have 16560AFN uarts, or better, then I could get decent
rates, but then I lose market size.

3) PCs typically don't have a spare serial port.

It is interesting that my mail is so far favoring an internal board
approach. Given that, and the forthcomming Plug-n-Plan spec from
Microsoft/Compaq/Intel/... and the hidious hassles of seting
up IRQs, port addresses, etc. Does this suggest that a
Plug-n-play board would be more attractive?

The key is that they would be more expensive, at least at first. Compaq
probably has the volume that can allow the cost difference to be
offset by lower tech support costs. I haven't got that volume yet.
