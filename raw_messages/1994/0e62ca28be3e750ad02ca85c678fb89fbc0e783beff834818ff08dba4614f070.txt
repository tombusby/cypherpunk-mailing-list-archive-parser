The talk PGP: A Peek Under the Hood will last approximately 30 minutes
and provide an overview on the internals of PGP, the e-mail privacy and
digital signature application for the masses. Bill Stallings, author of
the recently published Network and Internetwork Security and of a
forthcoming guide on PGP will also be available to sign copies of his
book. The talk is free and a light lunch will be provided. Seating is
