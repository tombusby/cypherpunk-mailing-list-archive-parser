I don't drink.  I do have a temper.
Of course you have a point, I did apologize to the list.

I agree.

While I appreciate your attempt to work damage control into the process, 
I simply cannot agree.  The withholding of information, in the 
cryptographic context, is simply not in any sort of alignment with my 
position.  Speaking of health issues is to bring the matter off point.  
Crypto is such that it simply cannot advance without specific and 
DETAILED accounts of flaws and potential attacks.  To withhold this 
information on the grounds that it might be damaging is silly, and 
moreover, potentially catching and slippery slope like.

To withhold it on moral grounds, then to insist that it is in accordance 
with freedom of information and privacy concerns is to see no farther 
than the rims of one's glasses.
