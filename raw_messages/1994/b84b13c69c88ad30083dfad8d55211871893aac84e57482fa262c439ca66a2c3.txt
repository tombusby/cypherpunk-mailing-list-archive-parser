Central nodes are not nice for various reasons, including the usual networking 
and security (trust) advantages of wide distribution. IAC a central node is
not necessary; for example, if each node were to output to the next:
  B sends Anum XOR Brnd (XOR msg) to C
where Brnd is B's random number, msg is B's message (if any) and Anum is the
similarly generated output of A. This is much closer to the original DCNet 
_bit_ flipping - the first XOR checks for equality while the second commits the
'lie' 

In this case whatever number A gets from D is the output of the net. There are
lots of interesting cryptographic sub-protocols to make too much trust 
unnecessary. I also believe that error-correction is best left to lower levels
of the network - there's no need for a DC Net not to assume a reliable data
channel.
