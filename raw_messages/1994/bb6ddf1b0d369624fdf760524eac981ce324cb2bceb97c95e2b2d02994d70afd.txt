   I've been pondering this for some time.  I think it's time to try a
   new experiment in anonymous remailing.  I think that all remailers
   should close down, then open up with new addresses and a single shared
   new policy... the new policy being that each individual remailer will
   do his best to 'out' all posters - complete disclosure, log files
   available, posts available, summaries show up via finger etc etc.

Cool idea.  Looks to me like Nate's remailer does most of this already.
