The Secret Service is a division of the Treasury Department.  One of their
main duties is tracking down counterfeiters.  If someone has stolen a color
copy machine, there's a very good chance that it was stolen for the end
purpose of counterfeiting.  So I would imagine that that would be why the
SS would be looking for this particular stolen property.  Make sense?
