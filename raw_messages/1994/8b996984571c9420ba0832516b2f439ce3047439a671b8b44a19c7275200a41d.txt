Thanks to the folks who answered my first question about the relative
strengths of RSA and IDEA.

Okay, 1024-bit RSA keys are easier to brute-force than 128-bit IDEA keys.
Currently.  We think.

That's what I should have stressed in the first place.
Aren't people more sure of what they think about the toughness of RSA,
than they are of what they think about IDEA?

(Less important question: how many RSA keys are there, as a function of
size?  I'm getting ln(2^(number of bits))^2, which can't be right.)

                 from noise - god is in the least significant bits
