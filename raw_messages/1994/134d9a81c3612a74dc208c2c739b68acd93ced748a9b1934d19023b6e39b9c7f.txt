Part of waking up and smelling the coffee is realizing that there IS a
government out there which makes and enforces laws which have an impact on
all of us.  Now I happen to believe that, on balance, it's a good thing to
have a government that is at least marginally representative.  But even if
I didn't believe that, I would believe that we should be working to change
laws that screw up our lives.
