You don't have to go quite that far (almost, but not quite :-)
You can do things like only accept your incoming mail via uucp,
which has a whole different set of holes and limitations,
but which is supported by a number of the major network suppliers.
If you're on dialup access anyway, uucp is fine.
If you've got a real IP feed, uucp-over-tcp has slightly more
authentication than smtp, and can turn off anonymous access,
but that basically means you're transferring your trust to your
MX forwarder's security system, which presumably still speaks port 25.
