I'm trying to get someone to create alt.steganography, 'cause I'm getting quite
a few sci.crypt types asking me, yeah ME, that's who they're asking damn
it, in great detail about the qualities of random noise created by various
sources such as a microphone or AM radio or a scanner. And about adjusting
checksums instead of direct LSB changes to store the data. Fractal stego is
coming soon too. And Apple's microphone sends sounds to a D/A converter
which does NOT output its noise as random. Awk! I try, but it's time to get
these people talking to each OTHER, not to me. I don't know how to create
a newsgroup, but if someone doesn't do it for me (us), I'll have to do it
myself. I certainly do know some people to ask how.

There's quite a few serious programmer types who want to create
steganographic software. I've gotten quite a response to my "announcing"
Stealth-PGP on Usenet. The person who gets credit for coming up with
the name "Stealth" instead of my boring "VGP" says he has changed plans
and hopes to offer an external utility to strip and later restore any PGP
message. For the newbies, this isn't just removing the "-----BEGIN..."
header and footer!

How 'bout it? At least tell me what the "proper" name should be for
the group. sci.steganography will take to long to get approved.
alt.steganography is OK, but isn't alt.security.steganography more
correct?
