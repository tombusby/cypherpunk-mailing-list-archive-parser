> ID/address/whatever, the encapsulated key contains the full key.  Lookup is
> done on the keyID and userID which locate the required key.  Details of the
> exact mechanism to be decided by the database experts - need to define message

> En/decoding

>  
> ASN.1 DER-encoding of keys/data, MIME en/decoding.  Needs to be discussed.

> Compatibility
> -------------
>  
> Backwards-compatibility code to handle old PGP keys and messages.   Presumably

> All user I/O then uses strings from the i18n database.  The database is

> Installation

> Others
> ------
>  
> Other routines as required.  For example, we each library should have an init
> call which registers an exit handler with a function called by atexit() to
