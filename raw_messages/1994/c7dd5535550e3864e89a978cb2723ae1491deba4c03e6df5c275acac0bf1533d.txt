One really annoying bug in all the remailers and such out there is the above
message. I figured it out the first damn time I saw it. I don't need a copy  
for every post to the c-punks list. The way they should work is send the 
notice the first time the rejection is activated. After that it should not
send any kind of responce, I am being rejected after all....
