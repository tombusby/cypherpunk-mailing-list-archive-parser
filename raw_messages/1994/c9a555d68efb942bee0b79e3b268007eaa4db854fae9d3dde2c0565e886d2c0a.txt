"Psychological Warfare is duofold.  It harrases the enemy, and hopefully wins
the hearts and minds of the population."

And then all you have to do is maintain your control over the 
situation.  Once you have persuaded everyone to come over to your 
psychological point of view and have won their sympathies, all you have 
to do is leave them to their own imagination and they will, like  
"herds", self-regulate and organize into a new paradigm of confluence 
according to the tribal provisions written into the Constitution by 
Thomas Jefferson, thus giving weight to progressive theory. Then for 
sure you would have a society based on consensual normalities, the 
horde for whom you would have prepared the way:  aware, informed, and 
actively participating in your aim.  Definitely, this would prove that 
Marbury v. Madison (1803) was a *not* a fuck up.  The Libertarian 
platform would not reverse that decision, because the Constitution has 
provided amending provisions, and we can always rectify the errors of 
shortsightedness.  I mean, the FOIA may be useless, but we *could* 
always sit here and read the damn thing.  Psychological Warfare is 
truly the only way to compete with the NSA on this issue.
