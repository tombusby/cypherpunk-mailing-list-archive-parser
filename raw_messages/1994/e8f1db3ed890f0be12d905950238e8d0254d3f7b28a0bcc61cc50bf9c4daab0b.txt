Because online directory services are not one of the extant solved
problems on the Internet, Netscape uses a simple approach - a small
set of "important issuer" certificates are compiled into the
browser. A future release will support "key rings" ala PGP. This is
all we had time for in this release...

All you need to do is get your server certificate from one of several
places, including:

	RSA (commercial CA or server CA)
	Netscape (not likely; we can't afford the liability)
	MCI (I don't know if they are selling this).

So the short answer is: it's hard to do right now. In six months it
should be a very different scenario.
