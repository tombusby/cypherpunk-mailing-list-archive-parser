Have they changed the .h files? My compiler isn't missing any functions
when I compile it.

Blaaah. I didn't have stdlib compiled into that module, so I didn't
notice this one.

There is a prototype for it in pgptools.h

Is this bad? I thought a function pointer didn't really care, as long
as you called it correctly.

I know, mine complains about that too, but it's a common programming
technique and there is nothing wrong with it. I've been ignoring that
particular warning.

Yes, when fifo.c includes pgpmem.h, it notices that in one of the
prototypes in that function. But the only function fifo calls within
pgpmem is safemalloc, so it doesn't matter. I didn't want every file
to include every other file, although it has been hard to avoid.

MPILIB has not been altered. It is the same as in PGP. PLATFORM appears
to set the appropriate modmult, but I usually define UPTON because SMITH
has given me some problems in the past.

This I hadn't noticed. You have to define NO_ASM or compile in 8086.asm.
Also define MSDOS and SMALL_MEM and DYN_ALLOC for an MSDOS machine. Take
a look at the PGP 2.3a project file.

True. I noticed this after writing the prototype. The public key might
be useful in the future if the modexp is changed, so I left it in.

I screwed up here. I meant to include the time in the hash and forgot
to put in the call to time. I just sent an update to csn.org to fix this
one, because it could reduce the entropy of the randomizer. Time was
already factored into the initialize, so it wasn't a killer, but it
badly needed fixing. Thanks for finding it.

What are you running, a Cray? My machine takes quite a few seconds to run the
server. How do you include this fast timer register? Not all machines have 
it, so doing so would be very machine dependent. You could put in ifdefs 
for the PC. I think PGP has this.

Yeah, I know, and so does fifo.c in PGP Tools. I hate error checking.
If I put in safe read and write calls, what do I do if they fail? You
could do this easily with some defines, if you have the error recovery
code in mind.

Thanks for pointing out that bug, and especially for setting up a Magic
Money server.

Diffie-Hellman Exchange addition to PGP Tools
Should appear on csn.org as dhex10a.zip

There has been quite a bit of interest in online crypto applications, such
as secure phones, BBSes, and TELNET connections. For these applications,
Diffie-Hellman exchange has a major advantage over RSA: there is no private
key to steal.

If RSA is used for key exchange, an attacker could record the encrypted
sessions, and then acquire your private key after the fact and decrypt
them. With Diffie-Hellman, the secret information is gone as soon as the
session is over. Using DH is equivalent to using a disposable one-time RSA
key for each session, but much faster.

This is a DH add-on for PGP Tools. There is a new PGPKGEN which exports the
prime-finding functions, the main files DHEX.C and DHEX.H, and a demo.

To use DH, we need a modulus n and a generator g. Unlike an RSA modulus,
which is a product of two primes, a DH modulus must be prime. (n-1)/2 must
also be prime. This makes the moduli slightly painful to find, but they can
be reused indefinitely. DHEX tests a modulus by first testing both n and
(n-1)/2 with fastsieve. Only if both pass is slowtest used. It still took
me a whole day to find the 1024-bit modulus in the demo. There is also a
512-bit modulus there.

To find the generator, we need the factors of n-1. They are 2 and (n-1)/2.
For each factor f, we compute ((g^((n-1)/f)) mod n). If this is 1 for
either factor, the number is NOT a generator. Generators are easy to find,
usually in one to three tries.

The modulus and generator can be saved and reused. Now Alice and Bob each
call precomp. This generates a private piece x and computes X=g^x mod n.
Big-X is the public piece. Alice and Bob exchange public pieces, then each
compute k=Y^x mod n where Y is the other person's public piece and x is
your own private piece. K will be the shared secret. We take the MD5 of
this number to get an IDEA key, which will be the same on both sides. No
eavesdropper can get this number. The public and private pieces are
disposed of - they are only used once.

This is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker carries
out a separate DH exchange with each party and then sits in the middle,
decrypting with one session key and encrypting with the other. A digital
signature will prevent this, if Alice and Bob have each others' public
keys. One approach is for both parties to sign their public pieces before
exchanging them. Another is to do the DH, go secure, and then each party
signs the session key and sends the signature to the other. If there is a
man in the middle, the session keys will be different. I prefer the second
method because a passive eavesdropper does not find out who is
communicating with whom. You can do this with the pgp signature functions
in PGP Tools.
