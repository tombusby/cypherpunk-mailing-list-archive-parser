On a DSP chip like the Texas C40, 32-bit multiplication takes one clock
cycle.	Modular reduction will take something on the order of one hundred
clocks.  Modular reduction is much more expensive than multiplication.

Not on DSP chips.  On the C40, reals are only 32 bits long, so there is
no benefit to using them.  They are less precise than integers.
