With all the anonymous remailers, etc, how do you expect this
to happen?  You yourself refuse to be identified (as is your

How can you have a police force?  Who will be there to see you type
something evil?  I can see you shoot someone and the judge can ask

use of modems an act can be committed anonymously since the real world
has no proof that was you who did something... only that it was your
account that was used.

Amazing that a person who has a fairly good grasp of the English language
and a pretty good vocabulary can't seem to find the shift key.
