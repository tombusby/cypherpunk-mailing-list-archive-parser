	I added a slight bit to the remailer installer that I've
written which allows you to setup a "tiered" remailer. A "tiered"
remailer is one which only sends outgoing mail to another
remailer.. that way the remailer that you might run would not come
under as much heat as a last hop remailer.

(A message such as:

To: remail@scaredsite.com
From: sameer@c2.org
Anon-To: cypherpunks@toad.com
Subject: hi


would turn into

To: remail@c2.org
From: nobody@c2.org
Anon-To: cypherpunks@toad.com
Subject: hi

when it went out of the remailer)
