The Xerox technology is essentially a series of tiny slashes and 
backslashes.  The slashes stand for a 1 and the backslashes a 0 - 
or vice-versa.  This gives you a binary data stream that
you can work with.  From what I understand, without looking at them
closely, the area with these slashes looks like a gray screen.

When I first read about this technology a couple of months 
ago, it was given as a way that sufficiently smart color
copiers could restore original color to a black and white copy.

Of course there are all kinds of other applications....
