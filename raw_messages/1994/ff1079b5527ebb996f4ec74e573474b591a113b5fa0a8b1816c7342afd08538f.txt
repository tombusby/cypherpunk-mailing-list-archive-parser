Does it concern anybody besides me that the CIA [with a bunch of 
underemployed manpower] is jumping into bed with the FBI [whose
spokesman recently testified to Congress that they didn't have 
enough manpower to enforce the Crime Bill on us]?

Does it make anybody nervous besides me that this is occurring 
at the same time that the 2ond and 4th amendments are being 
dispensed with?  While the Clipper chip and digital telephony
bill are being foisted on us?

Is there a trend here?

Ties to political aspects of crypto ought to be pretty damn 
obvious.

<>

<>

Guess Who?

  Here is the theory:  "It is thus necessary that the individual
  should finally come to realize that his own ego is of no importance
  in comparison with the existence of his nation; that the position
  of the indiviual ego is conditioned solely by the interests of the
  nation as a whole .. that above all the unity of a nation's spirit
  and will are worth far more than the freedom of the spirit and will
  of an individual..."

  "This state of mind, which subordinates the interests of the ego to
  the conservation of the community, is really the first premise for
  every truly human culture...The basic attitiude from which such
  activity arises, we call - to distinguish it from egoism and
  selfishness - idealism.  By this we understand only the
  individual's capacity to make sacrifices for the community, for his
  fellow men."

  These statements were made in our century by the leader of a major
  Western nation.  His countrymen regarded his viewpoint as
  uncontroversial. His political program implemented it faithfully.

  The statements were made by Adolf Hitler.  He was explaining the
  moral philosopy of Nazism [National Socialism].
