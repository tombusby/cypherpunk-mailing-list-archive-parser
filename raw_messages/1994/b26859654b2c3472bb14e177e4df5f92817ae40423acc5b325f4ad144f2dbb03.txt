Darling cyberanarchists out there, I am delighted to foward this
announcement that all of CA bills and legislative data are now
available for perusal based on the passage of a revolutionary bill for
Cyberdemocracy, AB1624. You will obviously want to stay away from this
FTP site at all costs, because to visit it would indicate that you are
actually interested in this nation's government, democracy, and may
even want to participate in the system you live in, all antithetical to
the goals of `cyberanarchy', as you have yelled into my and others'
ears with excruciating noise and frequency.

Jan. 22, 1994

On Friday, Jan. 21, 1994, the California Legislature began offering global 
online access to almost-all public information about legislation-in-process, 
all current state statutes, and the volumous California Constitution.

The state is prohibited from charging *anything* for access to or re-use of 
this electronic information.

Access is by Internet  ftp  and  ftpmail  ["ftp" = file transfer protocol].
Note:  ftpmail  allows anyone with access to the Internet at least for email 
purposes to access these files (that are often large).  ftpmail  provides 
access for users of FidoNet, CompuServe, GEnie, Prodigy, etc., as well as 
offering Internet users an option to direct  ftp .

README  and  help  files provide complete details.


FOR A GOOD TIME, CALL ...
  To receive the  help  file, send the following email:
To:               ftpmail@leginfo.public.ca.gov
subject:          <optional, the system ignores the subject-line>
Message lines:    connect leginfo.public.ca.gov
                  help
                  quit

  To receive the two README files, send the following email:
To:               ftpmail@leginfo.public.ca.gov
subject:          <optional, the system ignores the subject-line>
Message lines:    connect leginfo.public.ca.gov
                  get README_WELCOME
                  cd pub
                  get README_FIRST
                  quit

And await details of how you may finally participate in the process of your 
own governance.
  According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, California is the 
first state in the nation to offer almost all of its public legislative, 
statutory and constitutional information via the Internet, *especially* 
without charge by the state.
