I got my account a couple of weeks ago, I just downloaded the software. (I'm
a buyer, though I was hoping to sell too.) Recent 'shops' include HotWired.
I suspect one of the problems is that the software is not 'licensed for use
in the US' possibly for patent reasons? It says this clearly in the 
pre-download license agreement.

The trial gives you 100 dummy units of currency, which you can use to 'buy'
from 'shops'.

Actually not too much - PGP can process fast enough on a 486 as it is.

The 'new improved' commercial version of Mosaic, by those who left to form
a company. The freeware version of Netscape is probably the best WWW browser
for a number of platforms right now. Of course, PGP wouldn't be integrated with
Netscape as such, but into a local Web page - I'm looking at Web pages as
simple interfaces to various ordinary, not necessarily 'netted' tasks.
