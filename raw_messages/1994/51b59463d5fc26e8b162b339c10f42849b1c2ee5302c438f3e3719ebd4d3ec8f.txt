This sounds like it's a concern about subliminal channels in the
DSS/DSA signatures, a la the concerns raised by Gus Simmons last year.
I don't know what the use would be, unless it's concern (by whom?)
that viewing preferences could be back-propagated.

Well, this definitely fits with other signs that the Feds have been
"jawboning" with various industry groups. Key escrow, or "GAK."

If they're putting this kind of thing into their spec plans, somebody
has "suitably incentivized" them to.
