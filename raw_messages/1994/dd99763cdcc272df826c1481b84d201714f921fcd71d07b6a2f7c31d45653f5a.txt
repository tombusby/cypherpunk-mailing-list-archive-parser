Please embarass me.  Do you always approch things with the hostility
I am sensing, Perry?  I've heard this about you but this is the first
time I've run into it myself.  :-)

Yes, every chip set and DSP on the market in excruciating detail.  It
was only recently that I realized that I could use a simpler, cheaper
solution.  I'm an EE as well as programmer and I've actually got bills
of materials and schematics for this.  I'm not guessing.

And I'll be very happy to surprise you when the political dust has
settled, when I am satisfied that a patent filing isn't going to be
stamped so that even I can't look at it or talk about it legally and
when I find the bucks to patent it and build one.

I keep saying I won't argue and then I do.  :-)  Time for me to put up
or shut up.  I've tested these waters to my satisfaction and from the
feedback here believe that my solution is still non-obvious (until you
see it :-)  So, I'll be back to discuss this further when I can freely.


Later,

Bob
