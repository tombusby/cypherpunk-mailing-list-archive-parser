Flaming is no solution to this "problem".  In fact, this "problem" can, 
with proper guidance, lead to an enriching growing experience (forgive me 
for sounding camp).  Most very "naive" newbies usually get responses that 
are anything but helpfull; unless their queries are phrased in a 
submissive, almost servile tone.  At the very least, a certain 
humility is expected.  This pattern is by no means limited to
this list, or even the whole Internet.

It is the "presumptuous" _and_ "naive" newbies that get flamed the most.
They are the safest targets.  It may be wise to realize that even the
_most_ presumptuous and _most_ naive newbie has potential for enriching 
the group tremendously.

In these cases, flaming usually turns out to be even more naive than
whatever it was the newbie has/hasn't done to deserve the flame.  The
senior, as many have pointed out, should know better.

A great pity.  I suspect that some the contents of the archive may be far 
more educational than even the fabled "Applied Cryptography".  :)

Thank you for pointing that out.  However, it was not my intention to imply
age differences with the terms "newbie", "elder", or "senior".  Nor was 
it my intention to put anyone on the defensive.

For some, actual "live" conversations hold more in the way of being 
educational than any textbook, no matter how well written.  Your 
suggestion is well taken, nonetheless.

It would be ideal if every "newbie" had the time/energy to do all these 
before posting.  It may minimize the chances of "reinventing the wheel".

Luckily, I believe the "cypherpunks" list is a fine way to learn a little 
about cryptography.  Not only by reading, but by participating as well.  
It may not be as effective as actually managing to read and understand 
a 400+ page reference book on cryptography.  Nor would I urge any 
prospective cryptographers to to take this as their only route of study.
But it may be a good (dare I say "fun"?) introduction.

That is a problem.  There aren't enough!  700 dabbling cypherbabies and 
maybe a dozen serious cypherpunks are less than a handfull.  Perhaps the 
list needs to be subdivided (or renamed to something more boring :)  But 
I don't think we need to worry about there being too many of us.

I do not seriously expect a constructive, intelligent reply to every 
post.  I was meerly listing it as another ideal.  Constructive replys 
need not be public, BTW.  Especially if the topic(s) has been thoroughly 
covered previously.

Yes.  And, names would be comparatively mild to trashing his account 
(something which many readers are very capable if not willing to do).
And that would be mild compared to sending him a mail bomb.  In any case, 
the responses he recieved were mostly less than helpfull.  I certainly 
expected more from certain senior members of this list.

Flaming them(us) does not usually "get them up to speed".

I hope I'll have the time to become a serious contributor (seriously :).
I certainly have the intrest.
