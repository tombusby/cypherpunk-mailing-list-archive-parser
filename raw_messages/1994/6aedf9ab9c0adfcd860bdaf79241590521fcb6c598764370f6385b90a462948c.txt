Not to mention all of the repeating- non-ending games
	Shadow
p.s. i wonder if there is a "irrational" game....one that goes on to 
infinity but never repeats itself.....I would imagine not as there are 
only a finite number of possibilities for peices to exist on the board
it was an interesting thought whie it lasted....
