Key generation is one of the obvious backdoors; the wrinkle of making the
random number space from the keymasters small enough to search is interesting,
especially because they only need one key per batch to validate whether 
they've got the right guess.

My original reaction to the version described by Dorothy Denning
was that it wouldn't be very hard to *steal* the key-generating keys 
the keymasters bring to the key-generation charade in the vault, 
either physically or by leaking them out in generated keys or something.
Now that they've announced they're changing the script for the charade,
who knows how easy it will be?  They've certainly announced no plans for
validation of the key-generation software design or implementation.

No, that's a different argument; it's (name forgotten) vs Kaliski,
where the proposed method turns out to take as much work as factoring and
therefore doesn't rate as a backdoor.
