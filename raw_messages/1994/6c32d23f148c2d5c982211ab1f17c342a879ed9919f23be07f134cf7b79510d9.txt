Several people have sent orders to me without including an e-mail 
address. This is not a problem, but I would like to confirm the orders so 
you know they were recieved. If you know this is you, or think it may be 
you, please send me a note.


This is also the last call for orders. We will be taking orders 
until the 15th of February, so if you want one, send it ASAP. We will not 
be re-pressing the shirts, it is a one-time deal.

Ordering information can be obtained via anonymous FTP to netcom.com:
