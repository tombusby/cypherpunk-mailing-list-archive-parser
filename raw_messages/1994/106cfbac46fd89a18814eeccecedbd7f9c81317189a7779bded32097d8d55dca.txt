We last had a major thread on this at least a year and a half ago, so
it's worth looking at again certainly.

Before I get to Jim's scheme, bear in mind a couple of extremely
important aspects of physical package shipping vs. crypto:

1. The physical packages are extremely easy to inspect by sniffing
(for certain chemicals), by examination of the package exteriors
(unless "repackaged" each time), by x-raying of the interiors, and by
weighing and similar mass/moments of inertia characterizations.

2. Physical packages are _often_ inspected, if suspicions arise. The
level of security is vastly lower than for shipping encrypted bits
around. Many people who thought they could carefully wrap some hash up
and ship it home found out otherwise.

3. Since people cannot practically do the "envelope within envelopes"
nesting, for packages [they can, but it's trivially detectable], a
major element of mixes is lost. [Practically, any of the remailers
can mark packages, attach bugs, etc. A killer.]

Onward to Jim's scheme:

If the mix process it itself trusted, then the airport steps can (and
hence should) be skipped. Unlike the case with software remailers,
where additional steps increase the chance that at least one of them
is reliable (and hence mixes the traffic properly), physical remailers
have the property that each additional mix node increase the chance of
compromisinging things, of attaching bugs, of marking the packages,
and so forth.

Huh? Not much of an anonymous remailer if this is possible. (Our
Cypherpunks remailers can do this trace-back only when people don't
encrypt, and most easily only at the first stage. Properly executed
mixes don't allow such trace-backs at all.)

Jim's schemes elided. This is familiar stuff to any spy thriller fan,
as I am, and it was "losing a tail" that motivated me to think about
my "Labyrinth" scheme in 1987, which I then described to David Chaum
at Crypto '88, only to find he'd already formalized it several years
earlier. 

Both packages and people are easy enough to tag-and-follow that they
are not even in the same league as the cryptograhic security of
digital mixes.
