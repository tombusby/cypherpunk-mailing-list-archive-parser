PGP does this...   Not only does it complicate nested PGP signed messages,  
but if you pgp-sign an entire MIME message (i.e. by sending it to the  
autosigning service) instead of placing the signed doc inside the MIME  
boundries, it can cause mail readers to not recognize the MIME boundries and  
display the letter as normal ASCII-Mail.
