C-punks, 

To those of you who are not members of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science (i.e. subscribers to SCIENCE Magazine) I thought I 
would forward some information on their upcoming meeting in Atlanta.
  
Enclosed is a response I received in response to a query to the address 

amsie95@aaas.org.

The response was from

Environment" session.  Organized by Alex Fowler of AAAS and Caroline Whitbeck of
