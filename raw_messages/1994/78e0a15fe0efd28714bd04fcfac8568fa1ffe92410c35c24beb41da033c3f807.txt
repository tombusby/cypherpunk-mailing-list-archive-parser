I think this was me, or at least I've advocated that many people
become "first class citizens" be being remailers themselves. There are
thus no "sources" or "sinks" of messages...any Federales who pound on
your door can be told "Oh, but I was just _remailing_ that message you
traced to me."

This ubiquitousness is why I advocate "Mom and Pop" remailers,
including "Remailer-in-a-box" easy-to-install packages. (Apologies to
the "Internet-in-a-box" folks.)

Whether remailing services are free or not is not for us to
decide--the market will eventually evolve prices, strategies, etc. I
don't mean anything "academic" here, I mean simply that various people
will set their own policies. As long as we don't try to force people
to charge, or not charge, then all of them can compete. Maybe some
free remailers will exist (as many "free" things exist now, including
remailers), and maybe many people will pay a bit extra for
"businesslike" remailers. Who can say?

All as it should be.
