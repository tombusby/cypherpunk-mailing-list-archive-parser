Detweiler is apparently the only one who cares enough to waste any time
on this. He's been provided with ample information to prove or 
disprove his accusations. He has refused to do so, and in such 
a refusal, he comes off like a ranting loony. Is there any evidence
_whatsoever_ that these accounts are indeed one person?

P.Metzger and T.C May have both posted evidence that they are 
seperate people. In absence of _any_ evidence to the contrary,
I accept their word for it. I don't see a motive, I don't see 
any evidence. No smoking gun - from my perspective, it's simply
your word against theirs. Detweiler's given me not one iota of 
proof for your claims, just a blanket assertion. There is 
no reason whatsoever for me (again, I don't know anybody involved
here) to doubt their words. Detweiler, on the other hand, has alleged
a huge conspiracy that's gone to a huge amount of theoretically
tracable work (phone lines for all the pseudos in 3 different
area codes). This seems like an extremely expensive way to 
accomplish what should be a fairly straightforward (and I 
note, harmless) procedure.

I will reconsider that opinion if he can post whatever it is
that convinced you that this is one person.
 
I pretty much assume everything on the 
net is crap, since its an insecure means of communication. 
Anyone not convinced of this is politely directed towards 
their nearest zumabot posting.
