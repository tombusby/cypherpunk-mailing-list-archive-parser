Thanks to MIT & RSA Data Security, Version 2.5 of Pretty Good
Privacy (PGP) is now fully legal in the United States.

Since it's now legal in the US, there's no excuse for you to have
insecure e-mail from now on out. Here's how you can get it:

CLIX

* via newprod to my desktop CLIX box; look under "Security"
	newprod -n newprod@poboy.b17c.ingr.com

DOS/Windows/Windows NT

In either case, you should read the RSAREF 2.0 license file before
downloading PGP 2.5. If you agree with the license terms, have at it;
