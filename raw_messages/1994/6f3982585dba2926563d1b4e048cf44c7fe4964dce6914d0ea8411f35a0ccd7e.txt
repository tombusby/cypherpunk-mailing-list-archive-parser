There's an announcement in the latest comp.risks digest about a new
book on public key law & policy. I've reproduced parts of the abstract
below. It sounds pretty interesting.

Produced in support of the Federal Government's public key infrastructure
study, this book identifies diverse technical, legal and policy issues
affecting a certificate-based public key cryptographic infrastructure
utilizing digital signatures supported by "trusted entities." It examines
potential legal implications, surveys existing legal paradigms and the
structures and roles of relevant governmental agencies and presents various
institutional approaches to controlling liability. It considers the
underpinnings of a legal and policy framework which might serve as a
foundation for security policies and their implementation and concludes with
a series of recommendations, both general and specific concerning
certificate-based public key. Both public and private sector issues are
addressed.
