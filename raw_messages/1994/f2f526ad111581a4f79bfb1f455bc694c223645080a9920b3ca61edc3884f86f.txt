 An interesting sideline -
  I ran into an interesting situation at a local video rental place 
yesterday. If you give them your credit card number they charge you .25 
less a tape to rent it(2.75 compared to 3.00) Your number goes into their 
customer databse.

  I laughed, and said i'd rather pay the .25 a tape than take the chance 
of some part-time HS kid getting ahold of my CC number.

  It's unbelieveable (to me anyway) that people would give this kind of 
information out and trust that it can't be abused. It's bad enough that 
we're asked to hand out our SS number for everything.


   Brian
