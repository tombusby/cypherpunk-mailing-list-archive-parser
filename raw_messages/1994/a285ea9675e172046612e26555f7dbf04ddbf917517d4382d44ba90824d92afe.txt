No, no.  The function of Stealth PGP is, as I understand it, to simply 
encrypt plaintext into something that is virtually indistinguishable
from noise.  Deleting those "noise" files is a seperate issue.

What telltale TSR?  A program that can read and write directly to disk?
If I am not mistaken, such programs are common enough not to be
evidence of anything.  Having PGP on you is another matter, however.

With a standard direct disk read/write utility.

Disable authorization.  Most DOSs allow direct writes without 
authorization anyway.

This is not necessary.  In fact, as I noted, hiding your files in the 
same place everytime lessens security.  The alternative is a simple one.
Hide your files in different places, and keep track of them.  For 
example, a file that was encrypted on 02-23-94 could be written to disk 
starting with sector 022394.  All you have to do is remember the date and 
length of the file to retrieve it successfully.

Again, the program would be a standard utility that can write/read to/from
the disk.  One has to tell the program what tracks/sectors to 
read/write.  Having the program without the corresponding file 
address/length is useless.

You need _not_ have a TSR with the location.  If you keep track of the 
address/length yourself, the problem is eliminated.  The whole
automated (TSR) idea is only usefull if you are frequently accessing your 
disk.  In that case, saving your encrypted files to RAM temporarily might 
be a more elegant solution.  Otherwise, store your "noise" files 
sequentially, on a floppy that you use only for storing encrypted data.  
Guard their respective addresses/lengths as dearly as you would your secret 
key and it's corresponding password.

I'm sorry, this paragraph just went over my head.  Could you restate it 
in another way, so I can attempt to comment?

Absolutely!  I have anticipated this problem; and, have been awaiting an
opportunity to address it.

Steps must be taken to keep the deleted portion of your disk from looking 
too random.  In order to implement this additional level of security 
(through obscurity ;) one could:

 1 split the "noise" file into smaller parts which would be interspersed 
   randomly among the other deleted grabage.  This would make for a less 
   conspicuous disk; as, there are, normally, truely random sections of 
   the disk along with the not-so-random sections.  Your bits of noise-file
   will fit right in!

or

 2 use a steganorgraphy utility to embed the "noise" file in a section
   of the other not-so-random garbage (as some people currently use those
   same utilities to embed their PGP files in GIFs), and then delete it.
   (Owning a stegonagraphy utility would, of course, be as conspicuous
    as owning PGP.  So the same precautions would have to be applied.)

These options are very similar.  I prefer the former.  Relying on a stego 
utility seems to be as unreasonable as relying on a TSR to keep track of 
the location of your deleted "noise" files.  I would split and hide the 
"noise" file by hand, and keep track of its location by hand as well, to 
ensure maximum security.

Alternatively, one could use a "Mimic" function with a "DOS garbage" grammar.
This is effectivaly the same as option 2.
