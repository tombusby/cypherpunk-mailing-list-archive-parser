  Has the government been covertly working on artificial intelligence
  and such?  I wasn't aware that we were anywhere NEAR the ability to
  incorporate psychic abilities in computer chips!  Will Clipper read
  our minds as well as our data?  Will it plant "You are not a crook"
  thoughts in our heads?  What does the government plan to do with
  such a chip?  Will they prevent crimes before they happen?  Will the
  psychic impressions gathered by the Clipper be admissible in court?

  [Insert smileys to taste, simmer for 15 minutes, then throw the
   whole kettle soup out since it's only a joke.  Obviously they 
   meant psychological trauma etc.]

ObCrypt: Has anyone heard of work in the area of encrypting all information
		 on a computer and build the authentication software into the 
		 operating system so the only practical chance of intrusion is a 
		 forgetful operator?
