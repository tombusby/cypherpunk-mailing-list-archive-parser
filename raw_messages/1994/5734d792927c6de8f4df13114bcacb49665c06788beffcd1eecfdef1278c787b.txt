Clearly you and I disagree on a fundamental point. Which is more important?
Securing the document or securing the transport of the document. I believe that
today's problem for commerce is securing the transport. Solving this currently
widespread problem makes the Internet a friendlier place for commerce. It
allows sensitive information to be transported privately. Protecting against
forgery is the next logical step.

Let's pretend for a moment that you are right. IPSP is the way to go, today,
and that silly us, we should have used it. So now I go to my site manager, and
say:

	Please replace all that fancy expensive network hardware with new
	ones that speak IPSP so that we can do private communications with...

So who can I talk to? Name one router that speaks the secure protocols you are
documenting? Name one PPP based bridge that does? Show me, today, what
percentage of the Internet is covered by these standards? Give me some growth
curves showing how the Internet will quickly be converted to a secure network?

My point is not that IPSP is "bad". My point is that *today* it is irrelevant.
Tommorow is another matter.

In the future, I hope that you are right, IPSP is everywhere and we can all
breath a sigh of relief. In this case SSL is of little value. However, in the
mean time we have what we have. My company's network hardware is typical. It is
filled with expensive devices that don't understand IPSP or IPNG. In fact, most
of the world is constructed this way. What you are implicitly asking for is for
 the world to replace its networking hardware/software solutions before
allowing privacy. I think that this is a incorrect. SSL is a temporary solution
to a nagging problem. It's design was predicated on the belief that the future
is in protocols such as IPSP. Security will be pushed lower and lower until it
is omnipresent.

We never claimed the solution was new or interesting. However, it is a
solution.

You are making the assumption that the proxy is able to understand the secure
conversations between a client and its eventual server. This need not be true
and should not be true.

You must have missed a line in the spec:

         #define SSL_CK_RC4_WITH_MD5                     0x01
         #define SSL_CK_RC4_EXPORT40_WITH_MD5            0x02
         #define SSL_CK_RC2_CBC_WITH_MD5                 0x03
         #define SSL_CK_RC2_CBC_EXPORT40_WITH_MD5        0x04
         #define SSL_CK_IDEA_CBC_WITH_MD5                0x05

Note the inclusion of plain RC4 (not 40 bit), plain RC2 (not 40 bit) and plain
IDEA (again, not 40 bit).

If you have an exportable solution that can be manufactured in the US and then
shipped overseas, then that is something of value. Complaining about 40 bit
keys is not of value. The ITAR rules are what they are and at this point in
time we can't change them.

Not true. Distinguished names can be bulky, but you don't have to use them that
way. They can be made to map into DNS names trivially, and because you don't
have to have a single root, a web of trust is perfectly possible. Examine how
PGP self signed public keys are managed. Finally, "bulky and often expensive"
is a matter of opinion.

Please define a solution that is:

	distributed
	reliable
	supports an unforgeable name to public-key mapping
	standard
	not-bulky
	not-expensive

I will be the first to sign up and buy one. The market exists.
