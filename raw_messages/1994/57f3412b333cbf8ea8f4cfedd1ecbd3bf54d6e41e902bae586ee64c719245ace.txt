Any reasonable information-escrow agent *would* take reasonable precautions
against disasters like fires, floods, power problems, etc., and the fact
that what the government agencies are doing with the wiretap keys
isn't escrow, just storage, doesn't change that.  Doesn't require any
lying, because that's proper care of information and thet'd be criticized
very stongly for failing to do so.

On the other hand, if there's a mysterious narco-terrorist fire and they
*claim* that all the copies were burned up, the little shreds of belief
that get past my normal skepticism will have no chance at all.....
