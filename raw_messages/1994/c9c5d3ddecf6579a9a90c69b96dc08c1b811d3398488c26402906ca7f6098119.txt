Thank you, Nik, for that insight.

My friend Matt Blaze at Bell Labs showed that you can forge LEAFs on
Tessera cards so that you can use Skipjack without anyone being able
to get the key you are using. Its a slick piece of work -- slick

sure how practical it is, but its extraordinarily noteworthy.
