..but what of at least the original description which had the key generated
by a function within the sacrificial laptop (a PRNG driven by the two
key pieces supplied by the escrow agents)?

K_i = PRNG( E_1, E_2, i ) ;

If PRNG is secret (a high power NSA algorithm), it might be a *truly* high
quality one-way-function -- which happens to be independent of E_1 and E_2.

No one would be the wiser -- and the NSA's job would be a lot easier, in
the event that some chips get stolen or someone bombs the escrow center
and its backup sites.
