I have recently uncovered some old conventionally encrypted files
from back in '91, using PGP 1.0.  I remember the passphrase; however,
they won't decrypt and state that the passphrase is bad (this is 
using PGP 2.6.2.)

It occurred to me that PGP used some different algorithm (Bass-O-Matic?)
back then, and I don't think the current versions are backwardly 
compatible (but perhaps they should detect and warn the user that this is
the case.)

So, where could I get PGP 1.0?
