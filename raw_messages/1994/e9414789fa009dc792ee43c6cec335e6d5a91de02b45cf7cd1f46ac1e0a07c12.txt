Actually, the odds are better than this, .8^5, about 0.33.  You will be
compromised "only" 1/3 of the time.

But if you are sending regular messages to another party, then traffic
analysis will quickly show that you are communicating, because even if
the boys at Langley are really dumb, you won't make send more than
two or three messages without having all the cherries lining up.

You will be protected if you have encrypted your messages, but using
a remailer network offers little additional protection.

No, as I have said elsewhere, I think that an 'empowered user' of RN0.2
can communicate with another empowered user through a completely
compromised network with little risk, so long as there are many other
such users.  This is because the compromised gateways will not be able
to tell when and whether either of the users is actually communicating.
