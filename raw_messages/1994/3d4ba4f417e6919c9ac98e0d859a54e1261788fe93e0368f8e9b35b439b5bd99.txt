    With all the talk about the problems with escrowed keys (and there
are plenty of problems) has anybody considered that there must be a
backup set of the keys somewhere?  I can't believe that the gov't would
spend all the time, effort and money and let the only copy of the keys
be accidentally (or on purpose if I get a chance) to destroy the key
database.  Therefore, there must be a backup set somewhere.  Who is
guarding these?  Where are they?  Who has access?  Has anybody heard
anything about this?

                                                     G.C.G.
