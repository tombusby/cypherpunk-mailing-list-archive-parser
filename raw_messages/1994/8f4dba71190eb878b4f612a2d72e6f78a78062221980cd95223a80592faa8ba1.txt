	I was just advised to do that.  the problem is I would
	need to write something to allow me to do it without the
	sysadmins knowledge here.  He doesnt take kindly to
	anything like this at all. I mean he REALLY doesnt like
	it, and I want to make sure he doesnt get alerted
	obviously to it.  So perhaps I could just download my
	inbox, but then sending the mail messages may be
	difficult, since their is no place I can just send them.
	Perhaps someone hs already written a script to do this?
	I figure yo could just upload a file with all of your
	replies and new mail, and then have a script mail each of
	those letters.  That way my secret key stay on my home
	system, very safe, and I can use emacs to answer read and
	encrypt all my mail with ease.  This actually may be a
	good project, since it would make it alot easier for
	people to use PGP on multi-user systems.

	You're eqipped with a hundred billion nueron brain, that's
	wired and fired, and it's a reality generating device, but
	you've got too do it.  Free youself  ----Tim Leary----
