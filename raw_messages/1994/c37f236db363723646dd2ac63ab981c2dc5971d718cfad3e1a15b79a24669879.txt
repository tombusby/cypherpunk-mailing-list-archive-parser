I combined the "minimal" generator from PGP with another one.  The key
length is still 31 bits.  The way I figure it, that's enough to deter
exhaustive search by most entities, but it's not so much that there
will be export problems.  As long as I put strong cautions in the doc
about relying on this RNG as your primary cipher, and as long as it
seems likely to be secure against cryptanalysis, I think this is a good
compromise.

The minimal generator by itself is known to be insecure.  By using it
as input to a shift register, I think enough complexity is added that
it becomes an unknown again.

Comments are welcome.

/* This is a combination of a linear congruential generator and a feedback

** equidistributed results.  This LCG actually uses a modulus that's
** a power of two minus one, but that's close enough.
