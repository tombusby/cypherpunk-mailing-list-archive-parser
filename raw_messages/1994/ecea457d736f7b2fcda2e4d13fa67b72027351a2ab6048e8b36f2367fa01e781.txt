BACKGROUND: 

The Clinton Administration is backing a proposal by law enforcement
agencies that could make the entire communications infrastructure
susceptible to surveillance.  The Digital Telephony Proposal, reintroduced
this year after being successfully thwarted last year, would require
communications service providers to include "back doors" in their software
through which "wiretapping" can be done.  In addition, the proposal would
give law enforcement officers access to records *about* communications,
such as who you call, how long you talk, what online services you
frequent, who you send email to and where: if it's something you do
online, it is to be laid bare for inspection. Such traffic analysis can
reveal vast amounts of information about you, and the potential privacy
invasion is far more revealing than past techniques of traffic analysis. 
EFF is extremely concerned about this proposal and has prepared a
detailed summary to explain it and the harm it could do.  See:

ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Digital_Telephony/digtel94.announce

EFF has received a draft of the FBI's new, proposed "Digital Telephony"
bill.  After initial analysis, we strongly condemn the bill, which would
require all common carriers to construct their networks to deliver to law
enforcement agencies, in real-time, both the contents of all communications
on their networks and the "signalling" or transactional information.

In short, the bill lays the groundwork for turning the National Information
Infrastructure into a nation-wide surveillance system, to be used by law
enforcement with few technical or legal safeguards.  This image is not
hyperbole, but a real assessment of the power of the technology and
inadequacy of current legal and technical privacy protections for users of
communications networks.

Although the FBI suggests that the bill is primarily designed to maintain
status quo wiretap capability in the face of technological changes, in
fact, it seeks vast new surveillance and monitoring tools.
Among the new powers given to law enforcement are:

*  Real-time access to transactional information creates the ability to
   monitor individuals "live".
*  Access to communication and signalling information for any mobile
   communication, regardless of location allows tracking of an individual's
   movements.
*  Expanded access to electronic communications services, such as the
   Internet, online information services, and BBSs.
*  The power to shut down non-compliant networks

Several documents, including the full text of the proposed bill and a more
detailed section-by-section analysis are available via anonymous ftp on
EFF's ftp site, as well as an archived copy of this announcement, and
FBI Director Louis Freeh's Digital Telephony speech from late 1993.

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
