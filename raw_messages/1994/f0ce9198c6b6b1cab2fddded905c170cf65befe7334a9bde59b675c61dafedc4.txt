The LC does lack a FPU, but you can get one on a card.  I'm not sure if
this would help though, because it would depend if your compilier would
generate FPU code.  I know you can with Think.  You also might need to take
into account which compiler you are using for this kind of program, there
seems to be a vairation in efficency between Mac Compilers.

As for using toolbox calls, using Apple's SANE library might help. I
haven't had much experience with it, but it would probably take advatage of
the FPU.

E-mail me if I can help anymore. (I'll run the program on my Q700 if you
just need a quick speed test.)
