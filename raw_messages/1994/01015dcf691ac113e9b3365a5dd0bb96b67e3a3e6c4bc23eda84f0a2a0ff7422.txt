I don't see a problem.  Broadly put, news is broadcast e-mail.  There are
many sites which in fact do not distinguish between the two, the most
notable of which is CMU's Andrew Message System:  the admins of such
systems believe the "experiment" to be an all-around success.

If you want message A to get from site B to site C without a clear
trail, you've got to broadcast.  It's that simple.  It isn't a very big
problem that site B put something into the flow, so mail to news isn't
a weak point: an article can be injected at the remailer's site without
compromising the channel to traffic analysis.
