Today's L.A. Times had an article, on the front page of the Business
section, on the hazards and benefits of anonymous e-mail.  It opened
with a narrative concerning a fictional ("composite") company whose
internal cover-up of project failures was blown by anonymous mail.
There are some quotes saying that it bypasses hierarchical
stupidity, and some saying that it's for gutless harassers.  The
article mentions the situation on the Internet, including the basics
of remailer mechanics (no addresses, though).  Pretty good article,
with less than the usual amount of confusion.  Is the author on the
list?
