A few months ago there were several posts about the AA BBS case.  Here is
the info about the sentencing.


According to an AP story, Robert and Carleen Thomas were sentenced
December 2, 1994 to 37 and 30 months in prison respectively for 
"transmitting pornography via computer and selling obscene videotapes".

The defendents will be ordered to surrender their computer equipment
according to U.S. District Judge Julia Gibbons.  The defendants will
begin their sentences in about two months and will not allowed to
remain free during appeal.

The Thomases' operated the members-only Amateur Action Bulletin
Board System in California.  They were tried and convicted in
Tennesse.
