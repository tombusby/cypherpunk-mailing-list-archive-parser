 Thank you for the preliminary (<2 hrs) response to the posting.  I have
 not gotten a "that's a bad idea" letter yet of the 7 replies so I will
 assume this is a "Good Thing" tm.  

 In the interest of the mailing list volume I ask that you hold your
 information for now.  I will certainly accept "it's a bad idea" mail.
 I will put together a format for replies and post it to the list and
 anyone interested can fill in the blanks and mail it back to me.  I'm
 going to take my time and try to think of any useful information so
 we only have to do this once (good for you and me).  Look here for the
 survey and email it back if you want to be included in a list of c'punks.

 Also, please let me know if there is anything you DON'T want included
 and I will honor that as well.  

 Thanks for your comments, I'll keep the list informed of what I know
 when it becomes available.
   Jim
