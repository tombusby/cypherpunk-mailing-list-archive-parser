An interesting message from Brock Meeks, citing FBI Director Louis
Freeh's admission that the government may not be content with the
Wiretap Bill as written. We all knew this.

I hope the collaborators at EFF wake up.

During hearings on this bill yesterday (thurs.), FBI Director Freeh was 
asked if, at some point, he thought that the FBI would try to extend the 
coverage of this bill because, as Freeh admitted, "some criminals aren't 
going to be caught" because they will use communications systems not 
covered under this bill

Freeh said "it's possible" that the FBI would seek an expanded scope.  
It's clear the FBI isn't thinking of this bill as an end point, it's just 
the start for them.
