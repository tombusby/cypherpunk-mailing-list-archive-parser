The Clinton administration is artificially forcing the usa/world to adopt
the Clipper Chip as the standard for data/voice encryption, by using us 
government funded economies of scale to create a large pool of
cheap devices that would be hard to resist by the communications
using/manufacturin g community. In order to stop this obviously
undesireable situation from becoming the only option, a similar
counter-strategy must be employed to offset the saturation effects
of the flood of clipper chips that is to come. 


How to do it. 
-------------


1/ A massive public awareness operation must be started.  
2/ A crypographically strong alternative chip must be created.  
3/ In the same way that SETI was kept alive by contributions, 
   the creation of this alternative 'Zipper' chip must be funded by
   the public, and then manufactured in the millions, to take the   
   same advantage of economies of scale that the clipper will.  
4/ The zipper chip should then be distributed and publicized to
   completely discredit the clipper chip.
   

This is a very simplified outline of the kind of plan that needs to
be implemented. If we are going to save privacy for everyone,
economic warfare tactics must be used to counter the warfare that is
being waged against us all. PC based phone scrambling systems will
not have the necessary impact that will be needed to kill the
clipper chip and all of the nefarious uses it can and will be put
to. We must provide a strong, backdoorless, alternative chip that
will be attractive to every telephone user and communications device
manufacturer, who will reason that it is better to have a device
that no one can tap than it is to have a device that even _one_
person can tap. 
This situation _can_ be turned around.
