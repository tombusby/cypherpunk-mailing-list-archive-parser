> I suspect serious problems implenmenting a law that criminalizes crypto
It wouldn't be that hard to get rid of lots of it, as long as they
made exceptions to let the big corporate customers stay happy (e.g. banks).
The key would be using the civil forfeiture abuse to let them confiscate
computers that *appear* to be using illegal crypto; you can hire a lawyer
to help you get your box back if they suspect it's got UnAmerican Software.
Your goverment crypto license  will let you use Clipper if you obey the rules;
just think of it as your driver's license on the information superhighway....
The Feds could enforce the 55mph speed limits better if they used 
confiscation as well.
