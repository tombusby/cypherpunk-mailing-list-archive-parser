I certainly agree with Greg Broiles that this thread is appropriate
for Cypherpunks:

And digital money, offshore markets, Internet casinos, and the like
will surely have an effect on how money laundering, asset hiding, and
the like will be done. Very apropos to the list.

Besides, a new thread on money laundering schemes, one which even
touches on the mathematics of martingales (something many more people
should work out to their own satisfaction), is a whole lot more
interesting than tired old discussions of TEMPEST and whether Clipper
is good or bad (the topic is fine, but we've beat it into the ground
37 times and only Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight are known to
support it).

Sounds like a good idea to me.
