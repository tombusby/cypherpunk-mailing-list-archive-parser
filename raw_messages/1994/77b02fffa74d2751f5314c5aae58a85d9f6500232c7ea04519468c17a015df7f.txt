	Well, actually, it has begun again.  Apparently either it is
being done with cracked accounts, or someone is distributing the
script around, since the original messages came from
pbergman@netcom.com, while the latest batch (I got 3 this morning),
came from a different netcom user.  (Apologies for not having a name,
I misplaced the posts.)
	It's safe to say that this second wave is just an "annoyance"
one, as one of the people listed in the headers of the mail is
emmanuel@well.sf.ca.us, the editor of 2600.  Thus, I think this is
more for harassment of him than for any kind of serious attempt to
have peoples' accounts rifled.
	ObCrypto: How long until someone decides that anyone who posts
to alt.security.pgp is obviously a spy/kiddie porn collector/secretive
serial killer/UNABOMer/etc., and takes it upon themselves to notify
half a dozen people of such?
