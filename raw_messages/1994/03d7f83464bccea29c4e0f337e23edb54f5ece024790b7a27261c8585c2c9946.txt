Yes, there are such possibilitied.

Sure.  Are you offering to do the coding?

Until someone writes code to deal with owner-submission (or whatever)
you're SOL.  Even if all the operators were to delete all of your keys,
someone would eventually mail their entire ring to a server, and those
bogus keys would be back up again.

You mentioned that you didn't keep your secret key for one of your
now-defunct keys.  Why not?  Are the servers supposed to clean up after
you now too?

Do you know how to code in Perl?  Code submissions welcome.
