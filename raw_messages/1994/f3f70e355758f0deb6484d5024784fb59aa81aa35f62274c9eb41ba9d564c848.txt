A useful and delightful reference on this subject (and many others) is
_Number Theory in Science and Communication_ by M.R.~Schroeder,
Springer-Verlag, 1984.

Let me quote the first few paragraphs of Chapter 11, ``The Prime Divisor
Functions''.  I use LaTeX coding.

	Here we consider only {\em prime\/} divisors of $n$ and ask, for
	given order of magnitude of $n$. ``how many prime divisors are
	there typically?'' and ``how many {\em different\/} ones are
	there?''  Some of the answers will be rather counterintuitive.
	Thus, a 50-digit number ($10^{21}$ times the age of our universe
	measured in picoseconds) has only about 5 different prime
	factors on average and --- even more surprisingly --- 50-digit
	numbers have typically fewer than 6 prime factors in all, even
	counting repeated occurrences of the same prime factor as
	separate factors.

	We will also learn something about the distribution of the
	number of prime factors and its implications for the important
	factoring problem.  Thus, we discover that even for numbers as
	large as $10^{50}$, the two smallest primes, 2 and 3, account
	for about 25\% of all prime factors!

	{\large\bf 11.1 The Number of Different Prime Divisors}

	In connection with encrypting messages by means of Euler's
	theorem, the number of distinct {\em prime\/} divisors of a given
	integer $n$, $\omega(n)$, is of prime importance.  Its
	definition is similar to that of the divisor function $d(n)$,
	except that the sum is extended --- as the name implies --- only
	over the prime divisors of $n$:

	$$ \omega(n) := \sum_{p_i \mid n} 1 . $$

	It is easily seen that $\omega(n)$ is additive, i.e., for $(n,m)
	= 1$,

	$$ \omega(nm) = \sum_{p_i \mid nm} 1
		      = \sum_{p_i \mid n} 1 + \sum_{p_i \mid m} 1
		      = \omega(n) + \omega(m) . $$

	Of particular interest to our encrypting desires will be the
	behavior of $\omega(n)$ for large $n$, i.e., its asymptotic
	behavior.  We shall try to get an idea of this behavior by means
	of our usual ``dirty tricks.''

...and so on.  It seems unlikely that this development would be useless in
answering the question at hand.  I don't have time now to study further.
