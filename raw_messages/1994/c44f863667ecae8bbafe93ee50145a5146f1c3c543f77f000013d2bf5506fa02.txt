I posted this on alt.security.pgp, you can followup there and avoid 
annoying anyone. Sorry about that. Or just reply in clear if you think
anyone else would be interested.

I didn't change mpilib one bit. The date is still 5-17-93. The .h file
date is 5-9-93, so it isn't changed either.

I tried it again: if you use Upton's modmult, the problem goes away. If you
use Smith's modmult, the problem exists on both dos and unix/gcc. Try 
defining SMITH and rebuilding.
