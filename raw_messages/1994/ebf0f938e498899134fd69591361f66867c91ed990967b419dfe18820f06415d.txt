    I read this in the May 2nd issue of Microtimes, and asked the
    author's permission to post it here.  On rereading I think it
    suffers in the transcription, since it was originally a speech.
    And I'm not sure I understand or agree with everything in it.
    But I think it does contain some arguments worth disseminating.

> Chicago, Mar 26, 1994
>  
> 	I've been asked to explain why I don't worry much about the 
> topics of privacy threat raised by this panel.  And I don't.  One reason 
> is that these scenarios seem to assume that there will be large, 
> monolithic bureaucracies (of whatever character, political or 
> economic)  that are capable of harnessing computers for one-way 
> surveillance of an unsuspecting populace.  I've come to feel that 
> computation just doesn't work that way.  Being afraid of monolithic 
> organizations especially when they have computers, is like being 
> afraid of really big gorillas especially when they are on fire.
>  
> 	The threat simply doesn't concur with my historical 
> experience.  None of the large organizations of my youth that 
> compelled my fear and uneasy respect have prospered.  Let me just

>  
> 	It was recently revealed that the CIA has been of actual

> How could they keep that a secret?  Realistically, given current

> Don't they get it that everybody from Rush Limbaugh to Timothy

>  
> 	I've been waiting a long time for somebody from Fort Meade to

>  
> 	First, the kidporn thing.  I am sick and tired of hearing this 
> specious blackwash.  Are American citizens really so neurotically

> Sony Walkman jack in our phones?
>  
> 	Look, there were pedophiles before NII and there will be

>  
> 	But back to the speech by Mr. Baker of the NSA.  Was it just me, 
> ladies and gentlemen, or did anyone else catch that tone of truly

> playwright with a manual typewriter.
>  
> 	Is the NSA unaware that the current President of the United 
> States once had a big bushel-basket-full of hair?  What does he 
> expect from the computer community?  Normality?  Sorry pal, we're

> sober sort, someone to sit down with and talk to seriously?  Jobs?  
> Wozniak?  Gates?  Sculley?  Perot -- I hope to God it's not Perot.  
> Bob Allen -- okay, maybe Bob Allen, that brownshoe guy from AT&T.  
> Bob Allen seems to think that Clipper is a swell idea, at least he's 
> somehow willing to merchandise it.  But Christ, Bob Allen just gave 
> eight zillion dollars to a guy whose idea of a good time is Microsoft 
> Windows for Spaceships!
>  
> 	When is the NSA going to realize that Kapor and his people and 
> Rotenberg and his people and the rest of the people here are as good 
> as people get in this milieu?  Yes they are weird people, and yes they 
> have weird friends (and I'm one of them), but there isn't any 
> normality left for anybody in this society, and when it comes to 
> computers, when the going got weird the weird turned pro!  The 
> status quo is *over!*  Wake up to it!  Get used to it!
>  
> 	Where in hell does a crowd of spooks from Fort Meade get off 
> playing "responsible adults" in this situation?  This is a laugh and a 
> half!  Bobby Ray Inman, the legendary NSA leader, made a stab at 
> computer entrepreneurism and rapidly went down for the third time.   
> Then he got out of the shadows of espionage and into the bright 
> lights of actual public service and immediately started gabbling like

>  
> 	You know, it's a difficult confession for a practiced cynic like

> there, I've said it.   But I wouldn't trust Bobby Ray Inman to go down 
> to the corner store for a pack of cigarettes.
>  
> 	You know, I like FBI people.  I even kind of trust them, sort of, 
> kind of, a little bit.  I'm sorry that they didn't catch Kevin Mitnick 
> here.  I'm even sorry that they didn't manage to apprehend Robert 
> Steele, who is about one hundred times as smart as Mitnick and ten 
> thousand times as dangerous.   But FBI people, I think your idea of 
> Digital Telephony is a scarcely mitigated disaster, and I'll tell you 
> why.
>  
> 	Because you're going to be filling out your paperwork in 
> quintuplicate to get a tap, just like you always do, because you don't 
> have your own pet court like the NSA does.  And for you, it probably 
> is going to seem pretty much like the status quo used to be.  But in 
> the meantime, you will have armed the enemies of the United States 
> around the world with a terrible weapon.  Not your court-ordered, 
> civilized Digital Telephony -- their raw and tyrannical Digital 
> Telephony.
>  
> 	You're gonna be using it to round up wiseguys in streetgangs, 
> and people like Saddam Hussein are gonna be using it to round up 
> democratic activists and national minorities.  You're going to 
> strengthen the hand of despotism around the world, and then you're 
> going to have to deal with the hordes of state-supported 
> truckbombers these rogue governments are sending our way after 
> annihilating their own internal opposition by using your tools.  You 
> want us to put an axe in your hand and you're promising to hit us 
> with only the flat side of it, but the Chinese don't see it that way;  
> they're already licensing fax machines and they're gonna need a lot 
> of new hardware to gear up for Tiananmen II.
>  
> 	I've talked a long time, but I want to finish by saying 
> something about the NSA guy's one real and actual argument.  The 
> terrors of the Brave New World of free individual encryption.  When 
> he called encryption enthusiasts "romantic" he was dead-on, and 
> when he said the results of spreading encryption were unpredictable 
> and dangerous he was also dead-on, because people, encryption is not 
> our friend.  Encryption is a mathematical technique, and it has about 
> as much concern for our human well-being as the fact that seventeen 
> times seventeen equals two hundred and eighty-nine.  It does, but 
> that doesn't make us sleep any safer in our beds.
>  
> 	Encrypted networks worry the hell out of me and they have 
> since the mid 1980s.  The effects are very scary and very 
> unpredictable and could be very destabilizing.  But even the Four 
> Horsemen of Kidporn, Dope Dealers, Mafia and Terrorists don't worry 
> me as much as totalitarian governments.  It's been a long century, 
> and we've had enough of them.
>  
> 	Our battle this century against totalitarianism has left 
> terrible scars all over our body politic and the threat these people 
> pose to us is entirely and utterly predictable.   You can say that the 
> devil we know is better than the devil we don't, but the devils we 
> knew were ready to commit genocide, litter the earth with dead, and 
> blow up the world.  How much worse can that get?  Let's not build 
> chips and wiring for our police and spies when only their police and 
> spies can reap the full benefit of them.
>  
> 	But I don't expect my arguments to persuade anyone in the NSA.  
> If you're NSA and I do somehow convince you, by some fluke, then I 
> urge you to look at your conscience -- I know you have one -- and 
> take the word to your superiors and if they don't agree with you -- 
> *resign.*  Leave the Agency.  Resign now, and if I'm right about 
> what's coming down the line, you'll be glad you didn't wait till later. 
>  
> 	But even though I have a good line of gab, I don't expect to 
> actually argue people out of their livelihood.  That's notoriously 
> difficult.
>  
> 	So CFP people, you have a fight on your hands.  I'm sorry that a 
> community this young should have to face a fight this savage, for 
> such terribly high stakes, so soon.   But what the heck;  you're 
> always bragging about how clever you are; here's your chance to 
> prove to your fellow citizens that you're more than a crowd of net-
> nattering MENSA dilettantes.  In cyberspace one year is like seven 
> dog years, and on the Internet nobody knows you're a dog, so I figure 
> that makes you CFP people twenty-eight years old.   And people, for 
> the sake of our society and our children you had better learn to act 
> your age.
>  
> 	Good luck.  Good luck to you.  For what it's worth, I think you're 
> some of the best and brightest our society has to offer.  Things look
