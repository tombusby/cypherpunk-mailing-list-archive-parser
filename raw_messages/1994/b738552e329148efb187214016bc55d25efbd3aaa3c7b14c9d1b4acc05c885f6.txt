1.  I have been using various kinds of programmable logic devices in
    designs for years.	In doing such designs, you avoid using one device
    to drive another, because the effect of this is usually to increase
    your delays by 80% or so.  There are a number of reasons for this.
    (a) You almost invariably duplicate functions if logic is spread over
    more than one chip.  (b) The impedance and capacitance of the device
    pins and PCB tracks are far greater than those on-chip.  As a result,
    for example, the setup time on an input flip-flop on an Actel A14100A
    is 3ns, but the setup time on an internal flip-flop is 0.8ns, about 75%
    less.  In general off chip delays are an order of magnitude higher
    than on chip delays.

    FPGAs use longer internal routes than would be necessary on an ASIC
    and as I understand it the fuse impedance is a significant problem
    Both of these factors increase capacitance and impedance, slowing
    down the circuits.

2.  The redundancy should be completely obvious.  An FPGA is programmable.
    It has circuits whose sole function is to program the device.  These
    occupy space.  They cover the entire device.  Once the device is
    programmed they serve no purpose.

    An ASIC also has a fairly high level of redundancy, because logic is
    assembled out of elementary logic blocks.

    A custom circuit, such as a microprocessor, has very little redundancy.

    To understand the effect of this, go price a 64K bit static RAM. ($5?)
    Then calculate the cost of implementing the same function in FPGAs,
    especially with comparable speed.

For prototyping, speed is not usually a major consideration.  What you
are trying to do is to get the system to work, you are debugging it.

It was my understanding that the project involved on the order of 10^4 to
10^6 chips.

If the size of the system is small and the number of chips is low, then
the use of FPGAs would be justifiable (and I myself have justified this
in another context).

? what do you mean by 'design [an] FPGA' ?  Do you just mean "do the design
using FPGAs" -- easy --  or literally, "design a new type of FPGA"?  This
would be very expensive and pointless.	Commercial designers are almost
always going to do something cheaper and better than something done under
a government contract.

Why SIMD?  Why not a reconfigurable architecture as well?
