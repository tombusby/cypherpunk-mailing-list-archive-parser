Correctly implemented, with offline cash that grows in each transaction
until cleared online, this should reveal Alice's identity, not Bob's

If we fear double spending we insist on the spender presenting 
an expensive identity, an identity that would be tedious or costly
to replace.  The larger the amount, the stronger our concerns
of identity.  But the identity is known only to the parties to
the transaction.  (Who may be different tentacles of the same
biological person.)

The tentacle trick is what makes the existing identity based
checks on Bermudan and Hong Kong banks effectively anonymous.

If we do not like the identity, we ask for online clearance.

Quite so.  And with a smooth interface between the truly anonymous
online cash and the controlled nomity offline cash - an interface
sufficiently smooth that the spender rarely notices which his
software is using, we can have the best of both worlds.

It is all in the software interface, something notoriously lacking
from existing implementations.

Exactly so.  Like the use of slugs in vending machines.

No, but for offline cash proof of an identity that would be
expensive or tedious to replace is needed.

Exactly so.  We need varied kinds of digicash, for varied situations,
and a smooth interface between them.

Keep going, you mentioned, rather than explained, the problem of local
and extended clearing.

It seems to me, that rather than the one true protocol, we need a
collection of standardized protocol tools and anybody and his dog
can issue his own protocol for his own purpose, and the other
guys computer can understand it and can give its master a list
of options of what how the deal can go sour and who to finger 
if the deal goes sour in a particular way -- tell its master 
who the the master is trusting to pay and when.
