I hope we're all clever enough to realize that this is not very
good key verification.  If a spoofer has managed to spoof the
key to soda that you got, then he will spoof the fingerprints
that everyone sends you.  Finding a way to do this that can't be
spoofed is nontrivial.

However, you can take some reasurance, IMO, in the idea that if
someone was spoofing any given widely held key, such as that to
a remailer, someone would, eventually, smell something fishy. 
i.e.  one day you go to mail a message to a soda from a
different account only to have it fail because your other
account provider was spoofing you.
