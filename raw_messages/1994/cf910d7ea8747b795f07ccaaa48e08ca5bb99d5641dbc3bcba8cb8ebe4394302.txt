*******************
FBI HUNT FOR HACKER
        Kevin Mitnick is wanted by the FBI for suspicion of software and
data theft from leading telecom manufacturers and service providers. Among
his victims have been MCI and Digital Equipment. An ex-convict, Mitnick was
described by one judge as having an "addiction problem" with computers,
similar to a drug or gambling addiction. During a six-month treatment
program he was prohibited from touching a computer or a modem, but the
treatment seems to have failed, and one detective says: "I've always
considered him dangerous. I had to go underground. If he targets you, he
can make your life miserable." (New York Times 7/4/94 A1)

   I also read an article in the Pheonix paper saying that he did a wire tap 
on the FBI guys that were trying to find him...  among other things.

QUESTION:
   How do they know it was him?  I get tired of the News dudes printing 
stuff as if it were fact.
