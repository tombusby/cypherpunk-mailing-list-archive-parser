I think that most cypherpunks would be interested in this.  I realize
that many of you are on the IETF announcement list and probably have
already seen this, but I thought that I'd forward it for those of you
who aren't on it...

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.                                                               

       Title     : PGP Message Exchange Formats                            
       Author(s) : D. Atkins, W. Stallings, P. Zimmermann
       Filename  : draft-pgp-pgpformat-00.txt

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) uses a combination of public-key and conventional
encryption to provide security services for electronic mail messages and 
data files.  These services include confidentiality and digital signature. 
PGP is widely used throughout the global computer community.   This 
document describes the format of "PGP files", i.e., messages that have been
encrypted and/or signed with PGP.              

PGP was created by  Philip Zimmermann and first released, in Version 1.0, 
in 1991. Subsequent versions have been designed and implemented by an 
all-volunteer collaborative effort under the design guidance of 
Philip Zimmermann.  PGP and Pretty Good Privacy are trademarks 
of Philip Zimmermann.               

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address.  After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
     "get draft-pgp-pgpformat-00.txt".
A URL for the Internet-Draft is:

Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-pgp-pgpformat-00.txt".
							
NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.
							
For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@cnri.reston.va.us.
							

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
