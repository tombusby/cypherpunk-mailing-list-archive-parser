Modular reduction is scarcely worse than the multiplication. If I have a 60 word
multi precision number N to be reduced by a 30 word number M, I compute a guess
by dividing the 32 bit most significant bits N by the most significant 32
bits of M.
I then multiply this quotient by M and subtract that from N. That reduces N by
some multiple of M leaving N mod M unchanged. The error in the guess might
mean that N is less than 32 bits shorter than it was before the operation but
this method gets nearly 32 bits per pass. The inner loop of the is the same as
in multiplication.

For all of this using the floating point unit wins on most modern CPUs.
