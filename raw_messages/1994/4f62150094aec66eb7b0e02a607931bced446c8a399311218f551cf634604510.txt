SSL does not provide solutions for the class of problems elucidated by
store-and-forward mail systems. However, it does promise that the transmission
between two mail agents will be private. Depending on the configuration of your
network this may be all you need. Using SSL to "privatize" SMTP transmissions
seems useful to me. If the data being transmitted were PEM then all the better.

Something somewhere has to be able to speak IPSP. Something must be changed,
even if it's just software. If it is just software, then I have an upgrade
problem because in our network we have one machine from every workstation
manufaturer and every kind of PC and MAC imaginable. This is not uncommon, and
is a logistics nightmare. Once a service is relegated to only allowing private
communications, you are just as stuck as we are. There will be a class of
hardware/software that cannot communicate.

This upgrade problem exists no matter what security technology is used.

I believe your tone here is less than helful :-(. You weaken your position by
being insulting instead of sticking to the facts.

I would do one of two things:

1. Define a conventional way to use the DN (pick a subset like RFC1485 does).

2. Extend the set of attribute types supported by a DN.

Please provide a reference for "Photuris". The web crawler couldn't find it.
