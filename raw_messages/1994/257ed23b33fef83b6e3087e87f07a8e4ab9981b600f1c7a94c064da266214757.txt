i have uploaded pgp compiled for a VAX running VAX/VMS to the cypherpunks ftp 
site.  here is a copy of the readme file i included with it.  

i should note that the reason i did this was primarily to provide pgp to people who 
do not have access to c compilers or a PC/DOS machine.  this is, of course, not 
meant to substitute for checking the source and compiling pgp yourself.

PGP.EXE is pgp2.6.2. compiled on a VAX running VAX/VMS 5.5-2.  i compiled 
the program using the *build.com files that come with the standard pgp 
distribution BUT with TWO CHANGES.


THESE CHANGES HAVE NO AFFECT ON PGP,  THEY ONLY AFFECT THE CREATION OF THE 

RSA LIBRARY THAT IS DISTRIBUTED WITH PGP!!


changes were to made to the rsabuild.com file, these were:

1) commented out: $ call compile md2c

2) commented out: $ call compile md5c


other than these, no changes were made to the *.com  files.

i have tested this copy of pgp and it has worked perfectly with key 
generation and file signing as measured by generating keys on the VAX 
and then signing a file on the VAX followed by checking the signatures 
and key on a SUN using pgp2.6.2 that was compiled there.  

if you have a problem, please write me at:

finerty@msscc.med.utah.edu
pfinerty@nyx10.cs.du.edu
pfinerty@seattleu.edu

my pgp key is available via keyserver or finger.
