 I would like to point out that the two major Chicago Papers are
the Chicago Sun Times, and the Chicago Tribune. There is no Sun-
Tribune. I liked the references to "A Georgetown Professor" and the
obvious reference to Steganography, but otherwise this story reeks.

 Why the Hell post it anonymously? Larry are you out there?
