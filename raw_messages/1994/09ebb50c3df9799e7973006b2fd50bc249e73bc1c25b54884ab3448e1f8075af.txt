There are at least two models of remailer networks being kicked around.
In what I have called RemailerNet, if a gateway is compromised, then
some degree of traffic analysis is possible, and other parts of the
system become less secure.

Security increases when there are two remailers handling your traffic,
because then neither should know the identity of both sender and receiver.
Whether the addition of more intervening remailers increases the security
of the system in RemailerNet is a complex question.

In the second model of remailer networks, I also believe that using
more than two remailers and the random selection of remailers decreases
the security of the system if there is regular traffic between
correspondents.  To argue this at all, one would need a much clearer
model with all of the assumptions spelled out in detail.  For the
argument to be interesting, the model would have to be realistic.
My personal impression is that the second model is highly insecure
in cases where there is regular traffic between two parties and some
third party has significant resources.
