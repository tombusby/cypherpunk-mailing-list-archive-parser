I don't know whether you all have seen this: I've got a double-sawbuck that
says it's nonsense, but those of you who are into recreational paranoia may
enjoy it.  

I especially enjoyed the mention of the Bilderbergers...

>NSA can crack PGP

>A lot of people think that PGP encryption is unbreakable and that the

>mistake. In Idaho, a left-wing activist by the name of Craig Steingold was
>arrested  _one day_ before he and others went to stage a protest at government
>buildings; the police had a copy of a message sent by Steingold to another
>activist, a message which had been encrypted with PGP and sent through E-mail.

>Since version 2.1, PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy") has been rigged to
