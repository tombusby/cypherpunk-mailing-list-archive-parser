On Sportlight, I recall someone (Factsheet 5?) recommending another pub, 
the quarterly Paranoia (which you can actually buy on newsstands in NYC), 
because "they get a lot of stuff from Spotlight, so you won;t have to 
soil you hands with the original source."  It's a fine magazine, and even 
has an email address: paranoia@aol.com (but would a paranoid use email?)
