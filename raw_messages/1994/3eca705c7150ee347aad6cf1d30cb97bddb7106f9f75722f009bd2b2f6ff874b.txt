You have to be really careful when you invent new cipher modes, almost
as much as when you invent an entire new cipher.

It sounds like you have weakend 3-DES.  Where do you get these 4 bytes?
If they are fixed or deterministically generated, you will have made it
possible for an attacker who can brute-force 1-DES (e.g., with a Weiner
machine) to "peel off" each single DES key.  Instead of a 112 (or 168) bit
work factor (as with 3-DES), you'd end up with a 57 or 58 bit work factor.

If you randomly generate the 4 bytes, you have to carefully evaluate your
random number method.  In any case it sounds like your mode is the weaker
of 3-des and 1-des*(the complexity of your random bit generator).

Perhaps I don't understand how your scheme works.  Also, what intuition
makes you think that it's stronger than plain old 3-DES?
