Yeah, A/UX is rather overpriced. But you don't need it for a web site. Your
PPC can provide any Web service your heart desires without you having to
buy A/UX.

You can open an HTTP server using the excellent MacHTTP, a ftp site using
Peter Lewis' MacFTP, etc. You can even use perl on the Mac using MacPerl,
the list goes on. All these programs are available at your friendly
neighbourhood InfoMac mirror site.

 I am not so sure about the keyserver, though. I suppose it might be
possible to write an AppleScript for the new scriptable versions of MacPGP
and Eudora, but I don't think it would be worth the effort. There are
enough keyservers out there.

IMHO, the best source of info regarding running your own web server on a
Mac is the MacHTTP mailing list. You can join by sending a message to
listserv@oac3.hsc.uth.tmc.edu with "SUBSCRIBE MACHTTP_TALK Your Name" in
the body of the message. Also check the MacHTTP home page for announcements
and
frequently asked questions and answers. It can be found at:
