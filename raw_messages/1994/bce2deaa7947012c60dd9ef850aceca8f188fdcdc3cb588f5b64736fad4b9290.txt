The following was forwarded to me from aarnet-contacts@aarnet.edu.au, a
mailing list for organisations connected to AARNet (Australian Academic
and Research Network) -- the local Internet -- which provides our
gateway to the world. fyi: The AFP (Australian Federal Police)
currently have a machine on the network, and have for some time, it has
no DNS records but its registered domain is in the NIC.
