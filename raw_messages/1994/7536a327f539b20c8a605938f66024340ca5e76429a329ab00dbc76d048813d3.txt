Hello.

Has anyone heard of this organization?  The below popped into
my mail box unsolicited.  This is the "E-mail Version" but there

>Organizations, and The Persecuted and Oppressed.  
>
>INTRODUCTION
>
>HOW TO USE THIS ARTICLE EFFECTIVELY:  Place yourself in the position of 
>someone requiring maxium privacy AS IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.  You'll gain

>concrete insight and intuition that will help you avoid those seeking to 
>locate you, whom we will call the "tracer".  Seek to develop your own 
>individual and unique sense of intuition.  Intuition is informed by 
knowledge, 
>and knowledge should be informed by intuition.  This somewhat intangible 
>quality can make the crucial difference between safety and exposure of worse.
>
>HOW MOST MISSING PERSONS ARE FOUND:  If the truth were known, skip tracing is

>not an extremely difficult profession, and can be very lucrative.  The P.I. 
>(Private Investigator) is not the only kind of tracer.  When we speak of 
>tracer, we mean: P.I.s, Feds and Police, government and private spies and 
>intelligence agencies, collection agencies, bounty hunters, or anyone who 
>might want to locate you.  To find almost all of your "regular" skips, just 
>learn the readily available methods.  There are more books about missing 
>persons than any other area of investigation.  It represents the "bread and 
>butter" of many P.I. agencies.  Any good tracer will be signed up with one or

>more computer search services, and may locate many targets in just a few 
hours 
>or days.
>
>HOW MISSING PERSONS STAY "MISSING":  Our privacy seeker is serious, and has 
>made privacy a way of life.  He is hard to find, and makes up perhaps ten 
>percent or less of all missing persons cases.  Some investigators label these

>cases "difficult" or "impossible" to locate, often charging large fees 
anyway.  
>Some skips are fleeing criminal prosecution, prison, or engage in illegal 
>enterprises which demand absolute secrecy and security.  A high-level of
>sercecy and security is required for other legitimate enterprises too:  
>private investigation, personal bodyguard, critical and/or controversial 
>research, labs, and inventors to mention a few.  Unpopular or "deviant" 
>lifestyles, beliefs, and practices lead some individuals to distance 
>themselves from "society" as much as they can.  Certain totalitarian trends 
in 
>modern society cause some to want to avoid contact with government "Big 
>Brother" as much as possible.  Persons in failed witness "protection" 
programs 
>where security has been breached may trun to the private sector after being 
>compromised by feds or other cops.  Additional non-criminal reasons may 
>include: oppression from political, terrorist and dangerous groups, flight 
>from abusive families or cults, or fleeing threats of violence perpetrated by

>individuals.  It is not our purpose to judge or evaluate, and other reasons 
>exist.  All have in common as distinct need for privacy.  The techniques 
>discussed are used to achieve a successful level of privacy and secrecy, but 
>require DEDICATION AND THOROUGHNESS to be effective.
>
>SECURE COMMUNICATIONS
>
>MAIL:  Get all your mail at a P.O. Box in a ficticious name.  You will have 
to 
>fill out U.S.P.S. Form 1093 with a physical address (required), but you can 
>later "move".  Sometimes the post office will ask for an update of your 1093.
 
>This can be routine, but could indicate that someone is mail-tracing you.  
>They may have already received your "dud" address, and have continued their 
>inquiry by passing this information on the the P.O., who then ask you for the

>updated 1093.  The tracer can get a lot of free work done this way, but he 
>also runs the risk of alerting the skip.  The final word here is WATCH YOUR 
>MAIL.
>
>MAIL DROPS:  A "mail drop" or private postal box is sometimes recommended, 
but 
>"caveat emptor" is the watchword.  These services are available in most 
areas, 
>and are used by numerous individuals and businesses for legitimate reasons.  
>You can provide additional cover by having your mail go through a series of 
>drops, but don't forget there are directories of these addresses.  Because of

>Reverse Skip Tracing (discussed later), we don't recommend mail drops when 
>seeking maximum security.  Safest of all is to establish an address where you

>(or a trusted friend or associate) can receive your mail.  For the price of 
>some mail drops, you might rent a small cheap room or apartment in the 
"seedy" 
>area of town (if a particular type of address is not needed) where you can 
get 
>your mail in a group of mailboxes for that building.  You can pick up your 
>mail at varying times, or have someone else do it for you.  Make friends with

>the superintendent of a building so that your mail is delivered with that of 
>the residents (you don't live there, of course).  A cover story can easily 
>account for your need of this service.  A "homeless" person might persuade a 
>mission, church or other agency to receive his mail, but the amount of mail 
>should be small as not to attract attention.  These suggestions work best if 
>you don't get a lot of mail, and are not involved in illegal or other 
>compromising situations, which might lead to blackmail, exposure, or worse!
>
>GENERAL DELIVERY:  Sounds hokey, but it's a very good cover.  The Main Post 
>Office in a town or city is probably the best location as they are the 
busiest 
>and least likely to remember or notice you.  Try to appear properly 
>nondescript when going for your mail, and don't establish a pattern.
>
>CREATE A STREET ADDRESS FROM A P.O. BOX:  A box is not suitable for all 
>situations.  You will need a street address.  Every post office has a 
physical 
>street address, so send your mail there.  Example: You are Mr. A. Skipper, 
Box 
>911, Metropolis, TX 78444-0911.  Find out the street address of the P.O., and

>write your address like this: Mr. A. Skipper, 1411 Main Street, Number 911, 
>Metropolis, TX 78444-0911.  All boxholders now have an individual 9-digit 
>zipcode; its use should insure you get mail so addressed.  Some 
correspondents 
>tell us that an occassional nosey postal employee will say this is not 
>permissable, but generally you shouldn't have any trouble.  If you insist the

>employee show you chapter and verse in the administrative codes, you will 
>probably prevail, but you may draw unwanted attention.  In another instance 
of 
>a branch post office in a shopping center, there was difficulty obtaining the

>actual physical address as the employee claimed it was never used.  Even 
after 
>the address was obtained, some mail continued to be improperly returned to 
>sender.  You will have to weigh each case, but we recommend that you try 
>another post office or branch if you run into snags at a particular location.
>
>REVERSE SKIP TRACING:  Some ads for mail drops are just a ploy to get your 
>name and address, which is crossed referenced with lists of known missing 
>persons.  Even "legitimate" drops may sell their client lists, or allow 
>tracers to go through the names.  You can rest assured that every mail drop 
>will cooperate with the police or feds if they come around asking about you 
>(or your assumed name).  Many books recommend use of mail drops, but we see 
>too may possible hangups.  Is it possible that some of these "expert" missing

>persons authors are just making sure that maildrops have a steady clientel 
for 
>reverse tracing?
>
>ANSWERING ADVERTISEMENTS:  Keep your eyes open, and examine closely what is 
>recommended in some "inside information" or "underground" publications.  Be 
>careful in answering any potentially risky advertisement.  An example is 
found 
>in magazines catering to drug users and advocates, such as "High Times 
>Magazine".  Many ads are probable D.E.A. fronts, especially the ones for 
>information or paraphernalia for growing pot (marajuana), mushrooms, ect..  
>An ad for information on privacy, false I.D., or illegal scams (by little or 
>unknown companies), may be a front for reverse skip tracers - or someone else

>tracing people like you!  Don't avoid seeking new information, but be sure 
>your postal privacy is well protected.  If your return address is traced, be 
>sure they come up empty-handed.
>
>REGISTERED AND CERTIFIED MAIL and C.O.D.s:  Once you have established your 
>P.O. Box, the only mail coming to your real address should be "occupant" 
mail.  
>If Registered or Certified mail does come (could be C.O.D. or Insured Parcel 
>Post or ANY mail requiring a signature), say you are someone else, say the 
>person moved and left no address, moved months or years ago, say anything, 
but 
>NEVER sign for mail - no exceptions!  The carrier is out of line to ask who 
>YOU are, so this should work.  Tracers use this as a cheap and effective way 
>to locate skips.
>
>PACKAGES AND DELIVERIES:  Always pay with money orders.  Your receipt is 
proof 
>enough if required, and virtually impossible to trace.  Keep the receipt 
>blank; don't fill it in unless needed.  Although Federal Express, UPS, and 
>other couriers say they can't deliver to a P.O. Box, you can still use it.  
>Say on the order, "notify by mail at my P.O. Box for delivery instructions". 

>This causes a little delay, but the parcel agent will simply send you a post
>card with an 800 phone number so you can call with delivery instructions.  
>Have it sent to a safe address, or don't give them an address at all.  Pick 
up 
>the package at their office.  NEVER have ANYTHING delivered to your real 
>address!  That way, if anything does come, you will be alerted, and refuse 
>delivery as described.
>
>TELEGRAMS:  We think of them as old-fashioned, but telegrams are still 
around.  
>It's not a bad ruse either, and should be treated same as above.
>
>MAIL TRACING:  This is a cheap and useful tool, and is often the opening 
>gambit in efforts to locate you.  Look out for any suspicious mail!  All P.O.

>Box information on U.S.P.S. Form 1093 can be accessed by others.  Numerous 
>cover letters are avaiable, but the best way is to state that the individual 
>used the P.O. Box for business purposes, or that a court action is intended 
or 
>in the process.  The P.O. will release the records, including the physical 
>street address you gave them.  See any good book on researching public 
records 
>for more details.  If a tracer sends you a letter, and it doesn't come back, 
>he may be enticed to advance another level, such as a personal visit and/or 
>surveillance.  To deflect First Class and all other mail, consider buying 
>(through the mail of course) a small rubber stamp saying "Unknown - Return To

>Sender", "Deceased", "Moved", "No Fowarding Order On File" or similar P.O. 
>wording.  Be sure to drop it in a mail box NOT served by your regular post 
>office or branch.  Beware of responding to offers asking you to call for 
>confirmation because you have "won" a free cruise or whatever.  A postcard, 
>flyer or letter may offer a lucrative employment in your profession (or 
>something else you need or want) with a number to call collect.  It may be a 
>ruse by a tracer.  If family or friends' names are known, you may receive an 
>"emergency call" notifying you of the "death" of a loved one.  Don't respond-

>no exceptions!  Have a backup plan for emergency communications with friends 
>or family if you absolutely must have it.  So if a call comes, you KNOW it's 
a 
>ruse, and do not respond.  Advance planning is crucial.
>
>MAIL COVERS: If feds or other cops are tracing you, they may establish a Mail

>Cover for a 30 day period, with extensions.  A mail cover does NOT require a 
>warrant, so it's easy to use.  It is initiated by the agency working directly

>with the local post office.  They record ALL the information on the OUTSIDE 
of 
>the envelope, based on the premise that this is "public" information.  They 
>identify regular correspondents, contacts, abnks, credit cards, other mail 
>transactions, suppliers, business associates, and more.  Supposedly this does

>not delay your mail, but who knows?  It seems that it would delay it (given 
>the efficiency of most P.O. workers) or that you might receive mail in large 
>amounts when you usually do not.  Monitor postmarks, and if you receive a lot

>of mail, you should have a good idea how long it takes mail to reach you from

>various parts of the country.  ALWAYS WATCH MAIL AND DELIVERY PATTERNS.
>
>SENDING "SENSITIVE" MAIL:  If you use a mail drop, change it from time to 
>time, and always run your mail through more than one drop.  When quicker 
>delivery is needed, consider private delivery services.  Drop the package off

>at a pick-up point - do NOT have them come to you.  Vary your service between

>different carriers, and do NOT use post office Express Mail, particularly if 
>moving detectable contraband.  It is routinely X-rayed and "sniffed".  The 
>bus can be sued as numerous parcels are shipped everyday.  Common items 
>shipped are tools, auto parts and equipment of all sorts, but many suitcases 
>and cardboard boxes as well.  Even if you just have an envelope, wrap it in a

>large box and weigh it down so that it is similar to other boxes being 
>handled.  Use a typewriter for anything written, preferably a newer electric 
>model that doesn't leave a distinctive mark or indicate anything about your 
>key pressure.  For short notes, ect., consider taking your paper to a large 
>discount store where typewriters are set out for your demostration.  If 
you're 
>typing something that takes a minute of so, this is a good source.  Libraries

>often have typewriters available for use, so use a cover identity to get a 
>library card.  Better yet copy centers and business centers where 
typewriters, 
>computers, printers, and copy machines are located together.  No one will 
>require I.D. to rent you a typewriter for a half hour, and no one will 
>remember you among hunderds of users.  For very sensitive correspondence, 
>photocopy the letter after you type it, and send this copy as the "original".
 
>Develop an unreadable scrawl as your signature.  It's not always necessary to

>put your return address, and it is not required.  You must be sure that the 
>mail is correctly addressed, and that nothing inside would compromise your 
>location or identity if it were opened by the authorities (or a tracer - yes,

>they may violate the law!).
>
>AVOIDING MAIL TRACERS AT YOUR REAL ADDRESS:  Remove the mail box.  Remove any

>signs from doors, windows, outside or walls, which may draw unwanted 
>attention.  Never put YOUR name(s) on anything, and remove any old 
nameplates.  
>You can remove address numbers.  If the postman has no mailbox or no proper 
>address, he cannot deliver, and mail is returned "Undeliverable As 
Addressed".
>
>MAILING LISTS, PERIODICALS, AND SUBSCRIPTIONS: Use the Direct Marketing 
>Association, P.O. Box 9008, Farmingdale, NY 11735 to get off most lists.  The

>IRS uses sophisticated mailing lists to apprehend tax evaders, categorized by

>high-salary professions, spending patterns, lifestyles, and purchases like 
>vacations and luxury cars.  Get off as many lists as you can.  If you receive

>"junk" mail (or other unwanted mail), mark it "addressee unknown - unable to 
>foward", and drop it in a street mail box, preferably one not served by your 
>local post office or substation.  List users will delete your name to save 
>future costs.  Do this consistently; you'll be off more lists.  When you 
move, 
>do NOT send "Change of Address" notices to anyone.  Start new subscriptions 
>under your new name at your new P.O. Box.  If you subscribe to "exotic" or 
>unusual publications, you may be traced by this connection to your old life. 

>Large publications are probably OK, but if your interest is "The Vegetarian 
>Party Times", or Gum Label Collectors Quarterly", which has only a few 
>subscribers, you're taking a chance of exposure.  NEVER SUBSCRIBE TO A 
>NEWSPAPER OR ANY OTHER SERVICE USING A DELIVERY PERSON.  Tracers know these 
>individuals are aften talkative, nosey, and area a wealth of information 
about 
>you and your habits.  Buy it at a news rack, read it at the library, or have 
>it sent to your P.O. Box.  WRITE THE TRACER A LETTER, AND TELL HIM YOUR 
>"LOCATION":  An Air Mail letter from Guatemala City, Paga Pago, Cairo or 
>Australia saying you're there, and never plan to return to the USA can end a 
>lot of tracing activities, particularly those of collection agencies.  You 
>need a cooperative person in the other country to remail the letter.  
Business 
>agents for banking and forming corporations, and offices for rent in places 
>like Panama, the Isle of Man or other locations could be used.  Check the 
>classified section of The International Herald Tribune Newspaper, 
212-755-8785 
>for leads.  Some banks in Europe and other countries have good 
confidentiality 
>laws, and, if you have an account, some may receive and foward your mail for
>you.  Letters from diverse locations over a period of time might convince a 
>tracer that you are roaming about the world, another expatriate American 
>(there are lots of them) running from responsibilities back home.  A word to 
>the wise: watch out for mail drops abroad - tracers have lists and 
directories 
>of these addresses.
>
>TELEPHONE SECURITY: Depending on who's after you, there may be no security at

>all!  The feds (and others) can turn a phone into an area "bug" with proper 
>equipment.  If you must have a phone, be aware of the latest technology (an 
>excellent soure is "Full Disclosure Magazine, which is published monthly by 
>First Ammendment Press, P.O. Box 67, Lowell, Michigan 49331 USA).  Be sure to

>list it in a fictitious name or business name.  I'm told that Ma Bell now 
>wants you to be a corporation to do this.  That's OK - be a corporation!  If 
>they ask for a corporation registration number, find out what one looks like 
>in your state, and provide it.  If you receive a message or letter asking you

>to call someone collect, don't do it!  This is an old tracing technique.  If 
>you don't give yourself away in the conversation, the tracer will simply call

>the operator, ask for the time, charges and origin of the call and phone 
>number.  Since the tracer is paying for the charges, the operator will be 
>happy to cooperate.  Avoid cordless & cellular phones and radio 
communication.  
>Police (and anyone else) can listen and legally record these conversations, 
>which are exempt from wiretap laws.  You're using the open airwaves, so your 
>communications are literally open to anyone who wants to listen.  Numerous 
>scrambling devices are available.  Some cordless phones have variable 
security 
>codes, and you could combine this with a voice scrambler (one type of which 
is 
>available from Shomer-Tec, P.O. Box 2039, Bellingham, WA 98227).  This may be

>enough, depending on who's tracing you, but what one computer scrambles, 
>another computer can eventually unscramble.  This also goes for any "codes" 
>you might device or use.  In the ever-changing world of communications 
>technology and spy devices, "never say never" about anything, and always 
>assume that someone is at least one step ahead of you in sophistication.  
STAY 
>AWAY FROM ALL ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS IF YOU CAN.  If you must communicate 
>over these media, take every possible precaution.  Best of all - don't have a

>phone.  It's easier than you think.  A lot of phone use is habit anyway.  If 
>you must make calls, use safe locations like a friend's home or a secure pay 
>phone, but don't establish a regular pattern anywhere.  
>
>FACE-TO-FACE COMMUNICATIONS:  In past times, when your telephone wasn't 
secure 
>you could usually set up a face-to-face meeting.  The ready availability of 
>numerous "bugs" has changed all of that, especially the ultra-small micro 
>varieties.  Depending on the level of security required, it can be very 
>expensive to deploy counter devices and detectors.  They may be useless, and 
>give you a false sense of security.  Let's consider a few of the 
>possibilities.  If your meeting place is known, bugs can be planted in 
>advance.  Your contact will probably be bugless, but the whole area would 
>already be compromised.  Simple parabolic ears and smaller listening devices 
>can easily be employed if cover can be established.  These are generally 
>defeated by meeting in large open spaces, yet this presents its own 
additional
>risks.  Technology advances rapidly in theis field.  What was science fiction

>yesterday is common equipment tomorrow.  Never underestimate the 
technological 
>capacity of the tracer.  Who can you trust when it comes to bugs?  Trust no 
>one!  Even a friend or "safe" contact (or their car or home) can be bugged 
>without their knowledge.  After the tracer has identified your contact, he 
>will observe HIS patterns, just waiting for YOU to show up.  This is 
>particularly successful if you have a girlfriend, pusher, money source, or
