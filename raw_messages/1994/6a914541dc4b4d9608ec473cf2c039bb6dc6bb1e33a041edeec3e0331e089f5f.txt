i now have 10Ghost Marcs.  now, for something to spend them on ;)

next question, can one client hold coins of different currencies?  it 
appears that it can't.  for one thing the bank.key is a single key and 
not a keyring.  is it worth adapting mgmny clients to handle multiple 
currencies (servers)?  has this already be discussed?  

what do people think of releasing the mgmny package with the necessary pgptls
code together so that people who only want magic money need only fetch one
archive file, not both mgmny and pgptools?  

i have both the client and server binaries for SunOS4.1.3 that i will 
gladly make available (via email, i have no ftp option)
