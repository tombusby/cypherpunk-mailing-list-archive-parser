BSD random()

Here are the partial results.  Further tests were not performed due to
lack of time.  So far the generator appears to be comparable to a
shuffled linear congruential generator.

          DEFINITION:
            Generating polynomial: x^31 + x^3 + 1 (primitive polynomial)
            Initialize circular queue of 31 elements using ANSI C linear
             congruential generator.
            Recursion formula: a[i] = a[i] + a[i-3]

          RATING:
             1-D FAILS above 800,000 bpd      (bins per dimension)
             2-D FAILS above 3000 bpd
             3-D FAILS above 210 bpd
             4-D PASSES at 50 bpd (highest tested so far)
             5-D not tested
             6-D not tested
             7-D not tested
             8-D not tested

This is an additive congruential type random number generator.  An array
table[31] is initially filled with random numbers using the ANSI C
linear congruential random number generator.  Random numbers are then
generated using the recursion formula:

     table[k] = (table[k-31] + table[k-3]) mod 32

(Note that x**31 + x**3 + 1 is a primitive polynomial mod 2, which is
being used here as a generator.)  Since we are using the array table[]
as a circular queue with 31 elements then table[k-31] is just table[k]
before it gets replaced with the new value.  The recursion formula
becomes:

     table[k] = table[k] + table[k-3]

The generator works well in practice.  Knuth claims the sequence will
have period 2**31 - 1.  Knuth also claims there is very little theory to
prove that this generator does or does not have desirable random
properties.  I would be interested if anyone knows of any recent
developments in this area.
