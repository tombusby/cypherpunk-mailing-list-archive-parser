Not much crypto relevance, but ...

We've been concerned about this bug for precisely that reason-- serious 
scientific work. We are contemplating purchasing a Pentium and running 
FreeBSD on it to do scientific computation and while Intel has "fixed" 
the fp problem, I wonder if there are others that have yet to be discovered.

(As to why the bug slipped out from under Intel's quality control, another 
programmer here pointed out that default fp precision is 6 for a 
printf call and that the error occurs in the 7th decimal place. 
Coincidence? Chance? Grist for the conspiracy theory mill?)

Granted the bug won't affect PGP much, but you have to wonder about the 
integrity of a company that lets this kind of hardware slip out the door.
