This would of course assume that the police were silly enough to
use the disk and such from your machine in your machine. From my 
experience w/ Mentor and Erik Blookaxe during Operation Sun Devil this
is not very realistic. As I understand it they took the floppies and the
hard drives out of the original machines and used them on their own. This
was in case their was any 'time-bombs' installed. Another aspect would
be that the machine would have to be turned on. Also it would only work
once. Thereafter they would either examine the equipment in a Farady Cage
or else start doing pager rental scans prior to seizure.

There is a move here in Austin, TX to put GPS rcvrs. in our police cars
and then transmit the data back to base over their laptop channels.
