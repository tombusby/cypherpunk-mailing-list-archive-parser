I have a pretty good list of ID's and their characteristics, and
I'm about ready to make the list available.

I thought I might try something to make it interesting.

The list will be available to anyone who provides me with 10 tacky
tokens from the magic money application.

We'll see how this work.

I threw in the magic money bit so perry wouldn't complain that
my message had nothing to do with cryptography.  :)
