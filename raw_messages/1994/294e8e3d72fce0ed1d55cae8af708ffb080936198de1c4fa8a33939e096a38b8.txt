I had a nightmare last night. I sat bolt upright in bed at about 3:45 am,
and the only thing I could remember from the dream was an ad which looked
like:


Headline: If it's good enough for government work, it's good enough for you.

[Software box in the middle]
(looked like an Access or Word, or Excel box)

Tagline:    MS Escrow(tm): All the privacy we think you need.



Apologies to those MSerfs out there. I can't control my (hyperactive)
imagination sometimes...
