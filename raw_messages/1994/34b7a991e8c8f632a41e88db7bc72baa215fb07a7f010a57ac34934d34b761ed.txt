We grant Citizen-Unit May Approved Thought Pattern credits for suggesting
new ideas for our Unit Identifying Project. We note with some sadness that he
was unable to carry his Approved Thoughts to their completion, whereby the 
Citizen-Identifying Trade Units broadcast all trade transactions of their 
attached Citizen-Unit to all Clipper-Units in the vicinity, for the benefit
of surveillance and efficiency of society.
