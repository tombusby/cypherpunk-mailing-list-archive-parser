If you can't beat `em, join `em -- hence I wade into the fray....

Yeah, I'm sure that'll help a lot....

BTW, is that what that piece of obscura from Peter Cassidy the other day was 
supposed to be ?

Yes and no. The .GIF you sent before caused my copy of elm to dump core,
which was disconcerting but easy to remedy. I doubted that the picture you'd
sent was worth viewing, so I didn't bother trying to view it with xv on my
own. This message didn't prompt any error messages from elm, but it was a
nightmare to read, thanks to the plethora of angle-bracketed font instructions
embedded throughout the text.

The PGP-formatted messages don't cause my mailer to dump core, and don't
have any embedded command sequences in their bodies, so I don't go cross-eyed
trying to read them. That's a pretty clear line for me. YMMV.

Actually, I wish you'd send a full test suite of MIME messages to the list, so
I could compile a comprehensive list of the things I have to ask the tech
support people here to fix. My copy of elm proclaims itself to be MIME-aware
but hasn't done very well in practice. Another GIF enclosure would be handy, 
because I didn't keep the previous one.
