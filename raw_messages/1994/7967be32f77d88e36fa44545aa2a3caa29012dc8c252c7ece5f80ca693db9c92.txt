Amanda, we're not trying to push anything into the standards track.
We're publishing SSL as an informational RFC, and we have separately
submitted SSL as a proposal to the W3O working group on security
(in parallel with SHTTP and a handful of other proposals).  Nothing
is being pushed into the standards track.

We are trying to work with others in the industry and research communities,
via the above actions, by publishing SSL on our server, by participating
in this forum and others, etc., and we are generally succeeding, judging
from the overall high level of feedback we're getting from people genuinely
interesting in discussing the issues.
