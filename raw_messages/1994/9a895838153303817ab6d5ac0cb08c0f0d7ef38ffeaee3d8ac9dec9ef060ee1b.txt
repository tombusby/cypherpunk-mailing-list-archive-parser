Nobody is posturing or bragging. Perhaps I should have learned more
programming, to help advance the cause, but everybody has their talent and
programming isn't mine. Nonetheless, even if you don't like the messagers,
listen to the message with an open mind. This is not a flame war. No
insults. No critisism of a person.

If I thought that your were a hopless case and beyond learning, I wouldn't
spend so much time posting on this topic.

It would be uncalled for to post messages here in MIME. This list is about
thought exchange and the type of thought exchange that we do here can be
done just fine in ASCII. The same is true for most of netnews. That doesn't
mean that a different newsreader wouldn't make it easier on you. Have you
ever tried Newswatcher? Have you noticed that the latest software updates
posted to USNET are just a mouse click away? Can you honestly say that you
don't like Newswatcher better than tin?

Just different ways of trying to make you see the light.

I don't see any cheap shots or personal inuendos. All I see are a lot of
folks who like you and wish to help you as you helped them. You have said
that you don't want any help. That is your right, but understand that
unless you adopt some of the new tools the world will leave you behind. We
all have learned a lot from you (at least I have) and we know that the
sooner you start seriously using the new stuff the sooner you will help
improving it by your _constructive_ criticism.

Enjoy your vaccation <I mean it>.
