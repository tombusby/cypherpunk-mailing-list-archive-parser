To solve anonymous replys heres a little scenario.


Alice wants something from bob (crypto?) but dosent want bob to know
(or any others (NSA?)) to know.

1) Alice sends a request to bob via and anon-remailer chain.

2) In the request she specifiys that bob is to put a special code
   in the message and send it to anon-repostiory@nowhere.com

3) Bob sends the info + the special code,
   for whatever reason.  (Payment recieved?)

4) Alice sends a message to anon-repostiory@nowhere.com saying to
   copy bobs message (using special code) to a new secret special
   code (here code represents a file name)
   - This message could/should be encrypted and the repository
     should delete it after the copy is made.


5) At some indetermined time in the future alice ftp`s or sends a mail
   message to anon-repostiory@nowhere.com and retrives bobs message.

This should defeat traffic analysis but will do nothing if the repository
is compromised!  But the same goes for anon-remailers.


There are huge blanks in this, so does anyone want to comment?
