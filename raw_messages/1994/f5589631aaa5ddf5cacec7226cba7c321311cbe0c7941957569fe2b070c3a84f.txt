Eric & James, how about taking the "You're flaming me !" "No, I'm just 
insulting you !" portion of this debate to private email ?  I sincerely
doubt that very many people on the list give a damn about any of the above

> Each posting I made was about the standards making process.

Sticking to flaming about Internet standards, rather than flaming about who
didn't read whose argument carefully, would be much more productive IMHO.
