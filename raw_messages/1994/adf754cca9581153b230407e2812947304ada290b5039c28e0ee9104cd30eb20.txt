Laudable Paranoia!
In short the numbers: cipher, decipher, plain, d and e must all be
relatively prime to p and q for all of this stuff to work. In practice,
since p and q are very large, the probability of the cryptanalyst finding
another value d that deciphers your message is about the same as him
finding p or q. That is the same probability of him factoring pq by
guessing. In your example 138 out of 996980 is about the probability of
being divisible by either p or q. You might check to make sure that the
message that you are enciphering is relatively prime to p and q. You could
better spend your, however, verifying that your hardware had not made a
mistake, which is more likely, unless, however you are sending one of your
factors so that a friend can share your secret key. In that case, however,
anyone with your public key can compute your secret key,
