Russell,
	I appreciate your letter to me.  My political views are very 
conservative.  I know that this puts off a number of people, but we are each 
entitled to our own opinion.  I feel that we do need a government in power, 
but that they have a limited role in our society.  If we didn't have at some 
ruling power in control, the country would be in total anarchy and we would 
be taken over by some intolerate country.  The beauty of our system of 
government protects our rights.  We need a military to protect everyone's ass 
in this country.  I feel that the government infringes to much on other 
peoples rights in this country as it is, especially with the current 
president.  At least with a conservative government in control, they want to 
keep the money and the power in the hands of the people.

	The use of cryptography within our system, IMHO, is to allow us a 
right to privacy.  Personally I feel that the Clipper chip, is a severe 
infringement upon our rights, and I do NOT support its use.  Notice that I 
use PGP and not PEM or DES.  If someone is smart enough to use RSA, then they 
deserve to be able to talk in privacy.  I know that it can be used for 
alterior motives, but that is the risk with any tool that is available for 
use.  I hope this helps to explain my opinions a bit better.  I welcome you 
comments.  BTW, where are those political pieces that people have written.  I 
would like to look at them, to further educate myself.
