A major problem with having a single-point aliveness-info source is that
watching traffic to that source gives you some idea who's about to send
anonymous messages - multiple sources mean there are N sources to wiretap
to get the same information, which may be nearly as bad.
On the other hand, a broadcast method like a usenet group has the advantage
that you can read the newsgroup without being very obvious, except locally.
A mailing list is somewhere in between.

Similar problems occur with anonymous single remailers in the absence of 
good reordering; many new remailer users, or users of unreliable remailers
precede their real anonymous messages with a ping of some sort,
such as a message through the remailer chain pointing back to themselves.

If you're using a news reader without NNTP, or with NNTP only for the
local non-tapped LAN, you may be ok.  Another alternative are mailing lists
(NOT human-readable ones like cypherpunks) which reforward the remailer 
newsgroup information, preferably encrypted.

Newsgroups are obviously easy to inject bogus information into, but
that's the way it goes; any non-trusted system is, well, non-trusted....
