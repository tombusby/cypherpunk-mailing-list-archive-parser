I am more than a little concerned by this as I have just put PGP source 
and executables on my experimental WWW server (Australian based).
I announced it on talk.politics.crypto yesterday before I read this post.
I thought I was doing a service by providing a faster download for Aussie 
users (downloading big files from outside Aus is painfully slow). I hope
I'm not taking an unacceptable risk with my temporary residence visa :-(
I too made the mistake of assuming that the Aussie regulations were more 
relaxed (like those of the UK).

Oh well for what it's worth, here's the address:
