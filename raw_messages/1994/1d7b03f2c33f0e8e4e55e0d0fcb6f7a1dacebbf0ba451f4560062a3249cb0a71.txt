Ok, I grabbed second oldest version (this included a bugfix).
I compiles and seems to work fine when I use it with PTD.
It fails when run under Mixmaster. The failure is deep inside pgptools.
When I call pgpk_findkey to get a key from a public key ring (by name not
number), it chugs along checking each key id in the ring. Each time it
checks a key, it uses a pair of fifo's which it then destroys. After checking
the second id, when it is destroying kc (k is destroyed without problems both
times), I get a segmentation violation in the line
   nfb=fb->next;
Since kc was simply a copy of k
  kc=fifo_copy(k);
I suspect the problem lies in fifo_copy. These are all mem fifo's.
If you want to look at the source code I am playing with (with tons of debugging
printfs in it) let me know and I will stick it on my ftp.
