Delicious dichotomy.  Here are the more extended contexts:

What differing views of ``legal hacking''!

It would be wonderful if society's response to legal hacking had more of
the predictability of computer hacking.  But there are a hundred million
constituents out there (the power behind Perry's ``monsters'') who
gratuitously accept government benefits.  Such a person doesn't gladly
suffer any legal technicality standing between him and the pound of your
flesh to which he thinks he's entitled.  If you can prove that the law
permits you to keep your pound, then he and his majority allies will
simply change the law, requiring the IRS to collect it from you after
all.  This inclines me to accept Perry's cynical skepticism that legal
hacking can do any good.

On the other hand, Eric demonstrates time and again that his remarks are
not made lightly.  In this case, they bear on the prospects for the
``State Citizen'' movement that seems to be so emergent these days.  I
wonder how he would respond to Perry here.
