The most likely use of the Internet for gambling is for bookmaking,
not casino games. Encryption and untraceable digital cash will allow
even those "in [an] isolated little backwater of South Louisiana"
to compete for biz with the books in Lost Wages, NV and the larger
cities. The only real barrier to entry will be capital sufficient to
render the risk of ruin insignificant; thats not a _small_ barrier,
though.
