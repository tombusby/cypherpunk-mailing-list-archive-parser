Eric Hughes was one of several others who made good comments. Here, Eric
mentions the "beacon" idea he brought up recently.

(I have 20 or so posts in this thread, which I won't mail to the List as a
whole, but which I'll be happy to mail to a _few_ people who are _really_
interested in our thinking at this time. As you may know, I have archives
of about 50 MB of Cypherpunks traffic, sorted by threads (in Eudora) and
ready for mailing. No, I can't make it available for ftp, for various
reasons which should be obvious.)
