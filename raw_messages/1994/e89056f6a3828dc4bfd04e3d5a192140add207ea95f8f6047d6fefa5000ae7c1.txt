	Hoom. Last year, I was working on an idea I head, of making 
self-encrypting executables. It used a simple XOR with a hardcoded value. 
Not very secure, but that wasn't the point. The XOR was meant to deter 
decompilers and stupid k00l /<-Rad hackerz from hex-editing the strings 
in the program. It as, of course, vulnerable to debuggers, but I did run 
into code later meant to deter them as well...
	My ramblings here do have a point, and it's this: It's VERY 
difficult to get an executable protection or encryption scheme to be 
undefeatable. If they have a debugger, a decompiler, and various other 
crypto-verification tools, they can defeat your scheme. Put a CRC of the 
MD5 hash in the file to make sure they don't replace the hash? They can 
generate the CRC of their hash and replace it in the file.
	I have yet to devise or find a foolproof [ ;) ] or unbreakable 
protection scheme. I'mm starting to think there's no such animal. What 
you CAN do is protect your executables against file corruption, viruses, 
and lame-0 hacker dudez. But, getting any secure PGP-level security is 
very difficult.
	OTOH, if anyone else has come up with a scheme that is hard to 
break / unbreakable, *please* come formward and correct me. I have a few 
applications that I'd like to apply this to. :)
