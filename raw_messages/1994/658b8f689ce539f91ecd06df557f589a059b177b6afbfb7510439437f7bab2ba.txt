Roosevelt eliminated domestic convertibility 1n 1933.

Nixon eliminated international convertibility ("closed the gold window"
as it's often stated) in August, 1971.

The dollar was devalued from 1/35 oz of gold to 1/38 oz in December,
1971.
 
The dollar was devalued from 1/38 oz to 1/42.22 oz in Feb, 1973.

Of course, the devaluations didn't really matter since even the 
international convertibility ha been eliminated.
