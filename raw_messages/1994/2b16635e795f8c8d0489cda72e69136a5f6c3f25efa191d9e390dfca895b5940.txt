	 I'm going to make the almost certainly valid assumption that you know
	 more about the way the network works than I do, but my assumption is
	 this:  in the wacky scenario I described wherein Clipper devices are
	 installed in the network interfaces "everywhere", then the presence of
	 these identifiable (and identifying!) packets means that a central tap
	 at a regional switching center could concievably perform traffic
	 analysis without the need for taps on local loops anywhere.  Is this
	 assumption way wrong?

I suspect that you'd have too much data -- you'd have to be able to
scan every part of every conversation.  If you're going to go to those
lengths, you'd do just as well to tap the signaling channels instead --
a lot less data, and most of it organized the way you want it.
