Our own former member, but still all-too-frequent contributor, L.
Detweiler has achieved fame by appearing in the compilation of
net.cranks in the new group "alt.usenet.kooks." I had a hunch he'd be
listed there along with such luminaries as Robert McElwaine, Jack
Schmidlang, Gary Stollman, and Serdar Argic, and he was.

Here's in entry in the draft FAQ:


"L. Detweiler (you are all TENTACLES of the CYPHERpunk
anarchoSYNDICALIST pseudospoofing CONSPIRACY; everyone who contacts me
via post or email is a tentacle of a single Medusa): All information
relevant has been deleted (probably by the cypherpunk pseudospoofers);
ask around - old-timers can tell you about him, through "safe" avenues
(like email). Warning: attempting to disillusion him of his theories
usually results in threatening mail and getting incorporated into said
theories. Handle With Extreme Care. Appears occasionally on the news.*

Anonymity FAQ. (Posts as ld231782@<various>.lance.colostate.edu (L.
Detweiler) and an12070@anon.penet.fi (various constantly-changing
identities).)"


Which one of us will be next?
