Okay if you want to obfuscate your code on a much more secure level
albeit with some execution penalty, build public key encryption
into the CPU.  One would simply compile the program and encrypt it
using the public key of the chipset (680xx, 80x86, &c), then the
CPU would decrypt and execute the code on the fly using its private
key.
