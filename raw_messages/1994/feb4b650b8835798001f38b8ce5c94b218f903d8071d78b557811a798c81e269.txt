Even though your friend is no longer a U.S. Citizen he is a "legal 
resident of the U.S." in that he could not be deported.  Residence is 
defined at law as equal to "domicile" and is under the legal control of 
the individual rather than the State.  "Domicile" is defined as "Actual 
physical presence plus intent to make the place one's home."  Once 
domicile is gained, it persists even if you are away until one acquires a 
new domicile by one's own action.

So he could use the MIT version of PGP.  When their lawyers came up with 
their spastic language about users having to be U.S. Citizens or Green 
Card holders they weren't trying to be exhaustive.  They were clearly 
trying to mirror the ITAR crypto regs.  Since your friend, while not a 
citizen, is not an alien he can possess crypto technology under ITAR and 
thus under the MIT license.
