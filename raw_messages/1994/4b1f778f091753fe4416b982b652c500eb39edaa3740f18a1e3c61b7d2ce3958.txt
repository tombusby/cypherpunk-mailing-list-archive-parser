Subject: LAST CALL: Crypto export bill - one day left to make or break!
*DISTRIBUTE WIDELY AND QUICKLY*

ONE DAY DEADLINE!  The House Intelligence Committee will probably make their
decision on the vital issue of cryptography export tomorrow afternoon, Wed.
June 15, 1994.  If you've not had your say on whether the State Dept. & NSA
will be allowed to continue to restrict the flow of public cryptographic
products, write, call and fax *today*.  Updated fax information for the
entire Intelligence Cmte. is below, as is a sample letter, and background
information on this important legislative action.  If you don't get
through on your first fax attempt, keep trying.  All of these numbers
have been tested and are working as of June 14.

******* What You Can Do

1) Fax a short letter TODAY to the chair of the Intelligence
Committee, Representative Dan Glickman (D-KS).  Ask him in your own
words to leave the encryption provisions of H.R. 3937 intact. 
You may wish to send a copy of this to the committee itself also.
Fax number: +1 202 225 5398      Committee fax: +1 202 225 1991

2) If you are unable to fax a letter, send an e-mail message to Rep.
Glickman at glickman@eff.org.  We'll deliver it for you, provide it
arrives before noon, at which point all such messages must be delivered.

3) Personally urge everyone you know to send a similar fax to
Rep. Glickman TODAY, especially if they are among Glickman's Kansas
constituents.

4) If your own Representative is on the Intelligence Committee, send
him or her a copy of what you sent Rep. Glickman.

****** Sample Fax

FAX to:  202-225-1991 and 202-225-5398

Representative Daniel Glickman
Chair
House Intelligence Committee
U.S House of Representatives

Dear Representative Glickman:

I realize that tomorrow your committee will probably act on the encryption
provisions of H.R. 3937, the Export Administration Act of 1994.  I urge
that you allow them to remain as they were introduced in Rep. Cantwell's 
H.R. 3627, and subsequently incorporated into H.R. 3937. Privacy is the
basis for my concern, and I support the ability to use secure encryption. 
Additionally, prohibiting the export of secure cryptography from the United
States puts the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage internationally, for who
would choose to use crypography known to be insecure (such as the "Clipper
Chip", or products intentionally weakened to pass excessively stringent
export restrictions)?  Please, support privacy and security by preserving
the cryptography export language of H.R. 3937.

<signed>
