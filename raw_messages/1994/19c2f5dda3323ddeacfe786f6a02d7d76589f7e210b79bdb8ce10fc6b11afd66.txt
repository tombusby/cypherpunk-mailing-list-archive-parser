   Secure HTTP (S-HTTP) provides secure communication mechanisms between
   an HTTP client-server pair.  Our design intent is to provide a flexi-
   ble protocol that supports multiple operation modes and cryptographic
   algorithms and formats through option negotiation between the tran-
   saction parties.

1.1.  Summary of Features

   Secure HTTP has been designed to enable incorporation of various
   cryptographic message format standards into Web clients and servers,
   including, but not limited to, PKCS-7, PEM, and PGP. S-HTTP supports
   interoperation among a variety of implementations, and is backward
   compatible with HTTP.  ...
