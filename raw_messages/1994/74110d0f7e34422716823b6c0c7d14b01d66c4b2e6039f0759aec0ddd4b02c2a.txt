Well fellow Cypherpunks, I am amazed and shocked. One of our own, Phil
Zimmermann is in deep shit and it's about to get deeper. As of this date I
have seen very little discussion on how we can help him out.

The thing that shocks me the most, is that Phil and the PGP development
team have laid the basis for a lot of the Cypherpunk tools we take for
granted. And still with all of the distractions and worries that he
currently has, he's working on new tools, that I'm sure we will use and
implement in various projects. I think Phil deserves better than the
silence his plight has received as of late.

I know if we put our collective heads together, we can come up with many
ways to help him out. Organized fund raisers might be a good way to start,
or perhaps a fax campaign to make the media and legislators aware of his
situation. The possibilities abound. If we don't take care of our own, who
will?

This post might start a flame war. If it does, I do not apologize. At least
the topic is being discussed.

Nick
