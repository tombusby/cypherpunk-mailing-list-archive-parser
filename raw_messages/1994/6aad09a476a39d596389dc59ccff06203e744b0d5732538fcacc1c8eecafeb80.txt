Hi, folks.

I hope to be posting a lot less as "fnerd@smds.com" from now on.
I got a PPP account at The Internet Access Company (near Boston,
where I live).  I made sure my subscription to cypherpunks-digest
was working there, then cut off my cpunx subscription here.

THE NEW ADDRESS FOR ME:  sw@tiac.net (Steve Witham, former fnerd)

The fnerd@smds.com address will still work, but I'm hoping to 
spend fewer hours at work reading mail!

Let me tell you, for someone who's never had direct internet
access before, having it at home with a Macintosh interface is
fun!  (Bostonians: $30 for 40 hours/month, $25 to Boston
Computer Society members.)  I particularly like sending 
reminders to myself between work and home.

By the way, I've never trusted my PGP key since I got it on my
hard disk once.  I should figure out how to produce an official
revocation notice.  The PGP signatures on my messages were
a fake.  So for now you'll have to wonder whether I'm just a
tentacle of myself.  Fractal personality disorder?

Nah, just good ol'
