In my view, this is absolutely so unless it is attached to censorship 
guised as moral correction.

As I said, a proper response should have been the technical answer, 
followed by sage advice about the legality, and potential moral 
implications of use of the information as was proposed.

It is, and for this I owe the individual and the entire list an apology.

Coupling an argument for censorship with some kind of moral judgement 
reacted so fouly with my concept of information freedom that I became 
rather enraged.  Not that this excuses my behavior of course.

Lesson learned, wait 20 minutes after composing a message before sending 
the final draft.
