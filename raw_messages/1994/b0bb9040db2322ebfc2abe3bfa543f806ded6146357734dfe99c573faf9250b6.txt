Russell,
	Thanks for the info and encouragement.  My job entails accrediting 5 
VAX systems, two of which are running Ultrix, a Share system, and a Banyan 
LAN.  I also am in charge of anti-virus software for the LAN.

	I am working on digital signatures, since we have a problem with 
forgery around here.  Also I am working implementing PGP on a large around 
the compound.  I want to get in depth with cryptology, and learn as much as I 
can as fast as I can.  Please, if you have questions, ask them to me if I can 
help, as I know I will bother the list with mine.

	I learned about the list from the bugtraq discussion list.

Thanks !
