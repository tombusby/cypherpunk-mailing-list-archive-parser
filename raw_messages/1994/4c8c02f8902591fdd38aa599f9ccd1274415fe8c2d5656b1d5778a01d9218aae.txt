Pardon me if I sound a little excited, but: tonight, Bibliobytes
 made it's first customer transaction!

As far as I know, this makes us the first business in history (to
 be melodramatic about it) to conduct business *entirely* over the
 public networks -- the order w/ CC num was encrypted w/ RSA, we
 did the verification electronically on our node (true, through
 a modem to a third party -- we need infrastructure for e$!), and
 mailed the result back to the customer, all in about 15 minutes.
 (It'll get faster as I write the automation code.)

Am I correct?  Are we the first?

(And we issued a PGP-signed receipt, too!)

[BTW, I acknowledge that I snagged the T. Jefferson quote from someone
 here on C'punks.  It's just too appropriate -- thanks!]
