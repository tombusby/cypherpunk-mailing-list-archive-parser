	Why revoke the old one?  If I want to send a message I don't
think needs 2048 RSA bits of security, why bother with it?  I have
little doubt the FBI would get your key from your computer at 1024
bits.  Thus, the effort needed to compromise a key does not change as
one moves from a 1024 to a 2048 bit key.

	Threat models are really helpful.  They become more helpful as
one acurately assesses ones enemies.  Ronald Kessler wrote a book
called The FBI.  Its fairly evenhanded examination of the post-Hoover
bureau.  He does gloss over DT & Waco; they occured as he was
finishing the book.  Reading it will give you good insight into the
way the FBI, and its agents, work.  (0-671-78657-1)

| First you need to generate a key revocation for your old key

| the server.
