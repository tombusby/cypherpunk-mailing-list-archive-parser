Some of the peace movement folks I've hung around with over the years
were part of the "Resist paying taxes because they pay for the War Department"
movement, with various methods of not paying ranging from public refusal
to working in the underground economy to making less money.
Then there was that Thoreau fella....

If your political scale puts different sets of people who oppose
encroaching government control on opposite fringes, it needs some rework.
(Not to say that some of us won't cultivate the fringiness available
in any particular movement; many of us find the mainstream libertarian
"deep-in-center-field" position to be a bit boring....)
