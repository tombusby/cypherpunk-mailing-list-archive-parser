Well then, just have people anonymously mail messages to the
haven, with complete headers etc.. then to check your mail
you just ftp over and read the (automaticly maintained)
index file for messages that have a "TO: yourname@yoursite.com"
header, and don't worry about the 'downloading every
message' idea. This is the simplest solution I can think of
for the problem you state above, althoug it would be a big
improvement if the ftp server had a special command that
means "gimme my mail" or something... so a casual browser
wouldn't discover the names and email addresses of
*everyone* who was receiving anon mail.

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
