What about signatures?  You know (or at least you could) that I wrote this
note, thanks to PGP.  Crypto doesn't just hide things, it can establish
indelible trails as well.  In this particular instance, PGP has added to 
what you know, because the signature has added information to the post.

Crypto isn't just about secrecy:  it gives us a set of tools that allow us
to have a great deal of control over how much of a trace our actions will
leave, and who is able to see that trace.
