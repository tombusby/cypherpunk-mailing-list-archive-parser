The AT&T Surety Communications Voice/Data Terminal  4100  is
an STUIII with a type IIIe (e for export, read clipper) cryptographic
algorithm, the model numbers for type I and type II STUIIIs are series
1000 and 2000 respectively.

There are clipper phones that accept data.  This is probably the
one the DOJ buys.  Basing arguments on fallicies is counterproductive,
and is the sort of thing Tim May was talking about.
