Nope, no alt.anonymous.  'Leastaways, not off the servers that the turist
accounts use.  And since I configured news on the machine, I'd love to
hear if there are MIT servers that have a larger set than life.ai's.

Alas, I am but a turist at MIT, though one who helps maintain the turist
machine.  I'll be looking at getting a real newsfeed from elsewhere,
but asking the MIT newsadmins for favors isn't in the cards.  If anybody
here has a bit of a stronger standing on campus, their asking would
be way cool.

That would be a most excellent thing to do, regardless of how it affects my
situation.
