Below is the very preliminary list of state driver's license high tech 
methods information I have collected so far.
 
Thanks to all who contributed.
 
Note that "credit card" type driver's licenses are hard plastic cards 
without clear lamination.  This typically indicates a higher tech 
process.
 
Notes, suggestion, updates, and corrections are very welcome.
 
I'll note that no one seemed interested in paying tacky tokens for the 
list.
