Yea, MPI lets the precision.  This is not a bug -- the MPI library
needs to know how big the number is.  (The bug is that its done in a
global variable and not as a part of the number internally, but thats
a different matter).  The reason it needs to know is so that it
doesn't need to perform large operations for small numebers.  For
example, there is no reason to perform a 1024-bit modexp when you are
dealing with 384-bit numbers!

FYI: I have both big-endian and little-endian machines at my disposal.
Also, I was having problems building PGP Tools under mips-ultrix --
you have some global variables in ptd that you expect from time.h
which don't exist.  In particular, timezone and daylight.
