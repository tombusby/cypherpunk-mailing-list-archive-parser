I fried of mine had some cool posters brought home by one of his parents
who has works for the US Govt and whos job had ties to the NSA.  Some fun
as hell posters including on shoing a TeleVideo dumb terminal with a
hatchet stuck in the top and the title along the lines of "Those wily hackers
are out there, guard tht password".
