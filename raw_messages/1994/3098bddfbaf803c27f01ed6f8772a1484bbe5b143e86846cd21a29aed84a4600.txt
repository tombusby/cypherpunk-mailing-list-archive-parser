It is in so far as the two are connected.

This must be a personal view, it has no basis in law.

In fact you might have a stronger case in that you tried to prevent 
misrepresentation of your view with the anonymous post, took additional 
care to guard yourself in effect.

Again, you seem to want to make posting a strict liability operation.  

"Post and you are going to eat it," in effect.

Your are the free speech advocate, what will THIS do to freedom of 
expression if posting non-anonymously per se opens you to whatever 
defamation might be out there?

I don't mind be associated with discussion on cryptography.
I do mind if I am defamed as a radical anarchist with my goal as the 
destruction of nations.

Again, only in so far as the identity remains anonymous.
I only wish the entire world was as peachy as you seem to think it is.
It would be nice if everyone understood sarcasm, respected Devil's 
Advocate positions and imputed no motives.

The fact is, however, that Joan Rivers is still on T.V.

If I say :  "The moron who bought RJR Nabisco is a Nazi," I have refered to 
no specific person, but the meaning is clear.

Similarly if I refer to the "dolt who posts as tom jones is a Nazi" I am 
liable.

Easy for you to say, what did you have to lose?

Exactly.  A real world with a real legal system.
