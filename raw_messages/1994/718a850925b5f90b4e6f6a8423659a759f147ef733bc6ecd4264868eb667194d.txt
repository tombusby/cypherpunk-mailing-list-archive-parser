Someone offered recently to host mailing lists... the guys below have
hit a real problem and desparately need a new home.  I know it's not
directly a cypherpunk list (though they might in the future be persuaded
to work encryption into their system ;-) ) but it's a good cause and
damn good free software.

If you're the person who offered, could you mail the guy below 
directly, or mail me by reply if that's easier.

Thanks

PS There are several hundred people on the list, and traffic is heavier
than on cypherpunks!
PPS It's for a public-domain server that lets you mount lanmanager (DOS,
Windows) filing systems on unix - a free alternative to buying a commercial
NFS package for DOS.

Subject: Mailing list being suspended!

I have just spoken with the system administrator for the Samba mailing list.
We currently have load problems on the machine hosting the list. Samba mail
appears to be dominating all other list processing in terms of volume.

The mail systems are needed for real work, so Samba@anu.edu.au is being
suspended as of 17:00 AEST today, 11/8/94.

We may be able to rehost the list, but I'm not counting on it. If there is a
site out there that would like to host this list, we would be happy to
forward the subscriber list.

Regards, K.
