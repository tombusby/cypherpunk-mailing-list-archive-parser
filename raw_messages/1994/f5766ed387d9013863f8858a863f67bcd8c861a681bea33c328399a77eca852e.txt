You'll need to allow support for multiple transmitters, as many doors need
such support.  This is a trivial modification:

	{unit_id, counter, hash(key, counter[unit_id])}

The base station will need to keep the current key counter for each transmitter
it stores, indexed by unit_id.

Of course, one could also argue that the presence of the counter is
unnecessary,
as the receiver and transmitter both should KNOW what it's value/acceptable
range is, and transmitting it in the clear is unnecessary.

I would still argue that some sort of very coarse (~5 minute accuracy would be
sufficient) timestamp would be very useful here, although clock drift is still
a
problem (unless the base station tracked and recorded the drift).

Preferably NOT over an air-interface of any kind.

Bear in mind, folks, that almost all current systems are cleartext-to-air
passwords, usually 8 or 10 bits in length.  I have pulled apart enough units
to know, and it's amazing how many of their passwords are set to 0000000000!
