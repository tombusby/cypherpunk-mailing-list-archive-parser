For those who asked:

                       INFORMATION WARFARE
              Chaos on the electronic Superhighway
                         Winn Schwartau

                       ISBN 1-56025-080-1


I should add that at least one member of this list wrote and
doesn't share my opinion of it. Let the buyer beware! I am still
enjoying it immensely!
