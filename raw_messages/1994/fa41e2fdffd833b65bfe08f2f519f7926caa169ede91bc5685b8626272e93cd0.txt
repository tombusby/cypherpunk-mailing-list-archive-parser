Schneier has a good exposition of this in his book. It's worthwhile to
do the calculations, even back-of-the-envelope.

Assuming no surprise breakthroughs in factoring (in which case even 1200-1500
bit keys would fall, one would assume), a 1024-bit key is *vastly*
stronger than a 384-bit key, which just consumed several thousand
MIPS-years to break (to factor the modulus, of course).

Recall that the RSA patents begin to expire in a few years and are
completely expired by 2002. After that, the issue will be moot. And at
the rate at which things are moving these days, I expect an
MIT-RSADSI-blessed version of PGP--perhaps Version 3--to add features,
increase key lengths, etc.

I don't know any details of the MIT-RSADSI deal, but I think this PGP
2.5 deal is a GOOD THING, on the whole. It gives the national security
apparatus no excuses for cracking down on PGP, vis-a-vis patent
infringements (not that they enforce patents, but that was a cloud
hanging over PGP), and probably makes the export of PGP for Zimmermann
a non-issue. (Somebody will very quickly export PGP 2.5 to Europe,
presumably by very untraceable means).

As for generating a new key, I was planning to do so anyway...one
ought to change one's key at least 0.5% as often as one change's one's
underwear. (Awkwardly said, but you get the idea.) As there is not yet
a Mac version, I'll have to wait a while.

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              
Not too likely. Not even the next _five_ years.

By the time truly strong (last a couple of centuries) crypto is
needed, for critical financial trusts and cryonic suspension sorts of
things, this deal will help to make sure nothing can block the spread
of strong crypto.

A good thing.
