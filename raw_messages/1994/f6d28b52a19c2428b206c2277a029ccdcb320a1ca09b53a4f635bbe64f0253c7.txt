Fellow C'punks-
	I work for my school as a resident advisor, and we have to have
two programs every semester. One of them is supposed to be educational,
and I think I want mine to be about privacy issues, since it's such a
hot topic and not that many of the folks in my school seem to care about
Big Brother.
	What I want from you guys is pointers to papers I can use as
references, but stuff that's easy to explain to Joe/Jane College student.
	I would also like input as to how you folks think I should do it.
Should it be a discussion group, or should I just talk and then answer 
questions? I think a discussion group might be better, but I'm not sure.

	All input is welcome,
		adam
