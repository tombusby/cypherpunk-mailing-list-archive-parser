Okay, here is an updated remailer list

* elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu has been renamed to
elee7h5x@rosebud.ee.uh.edu.  elee6ue@rosebud.ee.uh.edu has been
renamed to elee6uex@rosebud.ee.uh.edu.  Other that that both appear to
working just fine, but I took them out of the list since I think they
are on the edge of extinction ;-)

* barrus@tree.egr.uh.edu is also down for a bit.  That was an
experimental one which had offered different features and a different
command syntax than the others... I'll look at re-enabling it after
making some more changes.

* Matt's new remailer isn't listed here yet, since I think I'll change
the format of this file to somehow seperate out remailers which work
differently than Hal's standard, like Matt's and barrus@tree.

* Mark Briceno notified me that ftp to 129.82.156.104 for MAC remailer
tools seems to be gone.  I can't locate the programs that used to be
there anywhere else (pgpc22.tar.gz and .Z).

* I've gotten responses from anon@hacktic.nl, but it now appears to be
temporarily down, so I'll add it in again when it's back up.
