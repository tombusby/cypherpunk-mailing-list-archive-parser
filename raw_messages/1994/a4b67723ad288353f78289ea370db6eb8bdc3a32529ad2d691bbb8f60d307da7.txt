However, NY Times Monday reported in long front-page article on 
spread of digitized forged checks, including dupe of magnetic 
ID.

Quotes:

"The proliferation of desktop publishing has brought a new 
growth industry, the counterfeiting of virtually undetectable 
fraudulent checks, and banks and law enforcement officials say 
the cost to the economy could reach $1 billion this year.

* * *

The American Banking Association says [this] is the No. 1 crime 
problem facing banks.

* * *

It is much easier counterfeiting checks than cash."

End quotes.


Says center of activity is California but has spread to all 
parts of the US.
