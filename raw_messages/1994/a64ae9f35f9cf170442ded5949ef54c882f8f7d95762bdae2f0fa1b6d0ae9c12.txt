     Speaking as the Pro Bono Legal Advocates vice-chair of my school and as
a future attorney, this might be possible, but consider the costs involved
besides the relatively minor ones of attorney's fees. I can't really give a
reliable estimate (Phil Karn, any idea how much of you appeal was spent on
hourly fees as opposed to expenses?). 
     Although attorneys on this list may be generally sympathetic the
expenses of federal lawsuits can be quite discouraging as pro bono
oppurtunities. Personally I find most pro bono volunteers will work in local
settings for indigent clients (Domestic Violence cases, AIDS related legal
issues, guardianship of minors, juvenile defendants, small claims mediation,
and other situations where expenses are low).
     Any attorneys out there want to take this up? Black Unicorn? Others?
Should that be the topic of my next handbook?
