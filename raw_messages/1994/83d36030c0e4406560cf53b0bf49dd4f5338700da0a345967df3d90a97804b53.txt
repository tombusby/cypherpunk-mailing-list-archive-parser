No, but close.  If the American people accept Skipjack crypto, they deserve 
every bit of invasion they get for their laziness.  Educate yourself or 
perish.  The day of government provided intelligence should be long 
past.  What a crock of shit.

I'm quite pleased I don't have even a trace of your ideals, thank you.

Though I suppose it's typical you should think your's superior to any out 
there.  Sanctamonous liberal who would spend my money to educate the 
lazy, what else would I expect.
