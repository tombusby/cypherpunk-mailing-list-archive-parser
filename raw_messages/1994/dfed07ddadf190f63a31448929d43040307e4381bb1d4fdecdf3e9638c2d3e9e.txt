Once again I find myself with an understanding that is exactly the opposite
of Jim's.  I must be missing the point of his network design.  In the remailer
networks I am familiar with, each additional remailer introduces another chance
of being uncompromised, rather than being compromised!  Only if all the re-
mailers in the chain are cooperating and logging messages can they recon-
struct the path my message took.  If any one remailer is honest, my message
is successfully mixed with the others.  A design in which any one remailer
in the chain can compromise the privacy of the user seems to have a very
big flaw.

Yes, this makes a lot of sense.  Use different jurisdictions to make attacks
by government agencies more difficult, use multiple remailers in a chain,
etc.  I just don't follow the earlier comment which suggests a different
model of information exposure than I use.
