More important is that it is difficult (infeasible) to find a file for a 
given hash value. (This implies that small file changes result
in large hash value changes.)

No, it is a permutation group. Use the Schreier-Sims-Algorithm to
find solutions.

No. It is a simple thing to find a turn which fits to a given 
state of the cube. When the cube came out a german newspaper
published a simple method for solving the cube. This means everyone
can easily find a "message" which fits to a given "hash value". This must
not be possible for a cryptographic hash function. The hash-function
must be a one-way function, but the cube isn't one-way.

Further more, the cube allows some kind of differential analysis.
Since turning the front side only affects the front side, you can
see what to do to turn the front side back. That's also not good
for cryptographic context.

It is still a problem to convince experts that a hash function is a 
one-way function...

Should not do this. The header is modified by transport agents, e.g.
paths and date are added.
