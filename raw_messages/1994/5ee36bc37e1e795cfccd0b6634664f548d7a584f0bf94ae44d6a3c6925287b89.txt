The same way companies have been made to commit not to kill dolphins,
or test products on animals, or give to Planned Parenthood: organized
public pressure, combined with threatened or actual negative
publicity.

Boycotts, letter-writing campaigns, and the like have worked wonders
for organizations ranging from the religious right to the ultraliberal
left. I see no reason to doubt that they could be brought to bear
here.
