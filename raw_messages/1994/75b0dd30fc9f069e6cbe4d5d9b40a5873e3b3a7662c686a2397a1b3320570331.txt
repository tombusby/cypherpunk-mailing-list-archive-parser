Hey, some of us have forgotton there are other number bases than
binary.  :-)

I don't remember that a good w depends on m but if a well-known m
could be calculated that is prime and big enough (I suggested a way
to do this via algorithm) then it seems you are saying that a w
would then follow algoritmically from the choice of m.  Right?

With a little luck you shall.  I want to apply for a patent on it
first but have been reluctant (as well as too poor) to file because
I fear it being snagged at the application stage by the national
security laws that I am told allow them to do that and stamp it
top secret.  Can anybody verify or debunk that?

Yes, when there is private sharing of any info, several means exist
that are secure but that leaves the problem of exchanging this info
securely in the first place.  My method obviates the need for any prior
exchange.  I have ftp'ed your papers and mailed them to where I have a
PostScript printer.  I'm anxious to see what you have done.

Yep, it has been found wanting.  There was some strong reason I found
it not applicable to my voice application but without my notes I cannot
recall it.  I spoke with Ron about that at last year's RSA conference
and he concurred.  Damned aging memory.  :-(


Peace,
