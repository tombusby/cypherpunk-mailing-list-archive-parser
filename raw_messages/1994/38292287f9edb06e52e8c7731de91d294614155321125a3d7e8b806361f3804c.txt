: 3. There is a test mode defined in the NAMPS standard that causes a phone
: to begin transmitting on a designated frequency. And since the mouthpiece
: on a cellular phone is not switched off when the phone is on hook, you can
: easily bug someone's car this way.

Woo! Built-in infinity-transmitter mode!  (Just like ISDN actually)

: 6. For under $1000, you can buy a box which hooks up to a PC and controls a
: scanner and decodes the cellular control channels (and reverse channel data
: too). This includes software for following cellular calls as they hop from
: cell to cell, paging requests (get a phones attention), and displaying the
: MINs that register in a given cell (or cells, but you need one receiver for
: each cell you are monitoring!).

These are selling on the black market over here in Britain for 3 or 4 K
pounds.  People who buy them use them to close phones, then sell time on the
cloned phone over a weekend before it's discovered.
