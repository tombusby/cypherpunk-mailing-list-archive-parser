1) Were DC nets to be considered an important service, Rishab's
   comment would be correct -- one can put things on top of other
   protocols much more easily.

2) To be interesting, DC nets require physically secure transmission
   between neighbors. Given that the internet is not physically secure,
   I'm not sure DC nets are going to run on the bare net
   any time soon. Presumably one time pads could be used to
   implement DC nets in order to maintain "unconditional" security or
   public keys could be used to maintain "good" security.
