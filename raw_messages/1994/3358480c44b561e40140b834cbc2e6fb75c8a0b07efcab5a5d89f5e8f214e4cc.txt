Someone posted something about SASE's and remailers.

Most of the hardcore remailer fans will undoubtably be bored by this,
but for the rest of us, this post contains a script that will cause
a text file called foo.txt to be sent back to me through a remailer
chain.  Just write your reply and save it in a text file called
foo.txt, save this post to a text file in the same directory,
and run unshar on the post.  (If you called the post sase.post, for
example, just say unshar -n sase.post.)  All of this assumes you use
unix, of course.

If you're going to send me something, a remailer list with PGP keys
would be nice.  I posted a request for such a list a day or so ago,
and didn't get any response at all.

And if you can't figure out how to make your own sase script, drop
me a line and I'll help you out.  Just make sure you give me a way
to get in touch with you.

Here's my public key if you want to encrypt your message to me.
I've used uuencode because the ascii-armour format native to PGP
chokes unshar.
