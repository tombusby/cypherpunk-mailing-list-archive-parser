Not anymore. Both CIA and NSA have recently (past few years) had "open"
employees and contractors who can admit where they work. Some can even admit
general information about what they do, such as "I'm a SyBase DBA in the
administrative organization."

In the olden days, the same minor "spooks" would simply tell you they worked
"for the government" or "for DoD"

So the old "If I tell you I have to kill you" line is left to Maxwell Smart.
