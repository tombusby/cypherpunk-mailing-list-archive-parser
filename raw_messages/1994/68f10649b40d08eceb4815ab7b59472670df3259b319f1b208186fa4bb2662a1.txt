I know of, and am supposedly subscribed to, several such sub-lists:

-meeting plans, or somesuch, devoted to planning regional meetings

-DC-Nets (Austin...and I may also be on the "Austin-Cyperpunks" list,
or at least I recall sending in my subscribe notice a year or so ago)

-Hardware Punks (for those interested in RNGs, phones, boxes, etc.)
 
-LA meetings (Jay Prime Positive)

-DC area meetings (I think this is one I got on, but maybe not)

-Lib Tech or Tech Lib (Nick Szabo)

(Sorry for not having the precise names...the lists are mostly so
dormant that their names are a blur. Everytime a new mailing sublist
was announced, I got on it.)


All of these specialized mailing lists have nil traffic, for whatever
reasons. Draw your own conclusions.

The "Cypherpunks Book" is another matter, one we've discussed. Having
a "workstation" available is absolutely the least important thing
involved.

Vincent Cate and others are already doing a fine job of making URLs
available, and the writing of book-length stuff is not something
easily done. I know, because I'm still trying to finish a book-length
document filled with fine-granularity stuff (a different task than
linking some number of essays and articles together with URLs for
Mosaic/Lynx browsers to access). (About 300K of text.)

I hope these blunt remarks do not cause more cries that I am being a
wet blanket.
