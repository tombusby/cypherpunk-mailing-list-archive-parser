I think that it's a great idea for enterprising cypherpunk publishers to 
print "exportable versions of restricted code." There should be a good market,
whether or not code is OCR-able. There may be a lot of unavailable code that 
could be worth typing. As a matter of fact, any plain font OCRs very well.
The costs of such publishing would be very low, and I for one wouldn't mind 
paying >$50 for such 'code books'.

But the listings for a library of ciphers are. Besides OCRs are quite good
nowadays, you don't really have to print in an OCR font.
