How well does a Tempest attack work with multiple machines in the same 
room? It seems to me that it would take additional equipment to filter 
out the different machines that are being run. It also seems that it 
should be trivial to create a noise generator that would make Tempest 
useless. Kind of like using a spark plug to foil older radar guns.
