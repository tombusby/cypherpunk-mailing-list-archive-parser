Actually, the casinos win in Las Vegas because the odds of almost
every bet are in their favor.  (Occasionally some blackjack bets are
good for the customer.  I believe that's the only exception.)

Larger capital allows you to affect the distribution of winnings, but
not whether or not the underlying bet is a good one.  Employment of
this strategy means most outcomes will be slightly positive with a
small chance of a loss.  The loss will be large.

Every casino, in effect, takes on the whole world.  As all the bets
are independent, it doesn't matter if they are played by one player or
by a new player every time.  The world has much more capital.  Yet the
casinos consistently win.

There is a way in which the futures markets can be used for quietly
and inexpensively transferring money, even if you can't predict future
prices.

Let's say a second payment channel exists.  However, it is expensive
in terms of cost, privacy, or hassle.  It also has the property that
the cost of transferring $10,000 is the same as transferring $100,000.

Most of the time, when you play the futures markets you can get some
amount of money to transfer.  Once in awhile it doesn't work, so you
use the second, expensive, payment channel.
