sophistication with secure methods of sending voice and data are
SECURE. IF YOU ARE STUPID ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE CONGRESSMEN

No free man shall ever be de-barred the use of arms. The strongest
reason for the people to retain  there right to keep and bear arms
is as a last  resort to  protect  themselves  against  tyranny  in
government. <-------- Thomas Jefferson                            --
