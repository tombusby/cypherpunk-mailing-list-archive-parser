After testing several remailers this weekend, three have given no reply. 
remail@c2.org (does this remailer support Request-Remailing-To:?) has not 
gotten back to me, nor has catalyst@netcom.com or remailer@rebma.mn.org.
anon@cyberspace.org mailed me back from its mail daemon to tell me no such 
account, as did nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu.

The following worked:
remailer@ds1.wu-wien.ac.at    very fast
remailer@chaos.bsu.edu        very fast
rperkins@nyx.cs.du.edu        very fast
hal@alumni.caltech.edu        very fast
hfinney@shell.portal.com      very fast
remail@extropia.wimsey.com    took a couple of hrs.
ghio@kaiwan.com               very fast
remail@vox.hacktic.nl         took overnight but it's not in this country :-)

Does anyone know if catalyst and rebma are still on line?
