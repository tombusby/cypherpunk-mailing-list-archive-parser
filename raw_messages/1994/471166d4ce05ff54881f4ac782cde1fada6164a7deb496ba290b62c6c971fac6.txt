Paul, 

I appreciate your reply, especially the information that I can use to
reconstruct my account. I never received the mail that Branko
originally sent. Evidently no one received my repeated requests sent
after the first one.

I was unclear in my original statement. You, Marcel, and others did
respond to my comments and questions-- specifically to my concerns
about when ecash systems would be available for real use. My upset
came from the fact that once my shop stopped working, I didn't get a
response.

First of all, Hal Finney wrote the paragraph which mentions lack of
consideration. My own feelings toward Digicash-- which you confirm--
are that you have more work to do than you can presently handle. I
understand that; it's not uncommon, and I don't hold it against you.
It _does_ hamper my ability to set up services for which I can be paid.

This is a good point. I do understand that this is a beta test, and
that problems will occur. I also want to confirm for other readers
that you did respond to my mail; in the most important case I didn't
get the response.

Thanks for your detailed response.
