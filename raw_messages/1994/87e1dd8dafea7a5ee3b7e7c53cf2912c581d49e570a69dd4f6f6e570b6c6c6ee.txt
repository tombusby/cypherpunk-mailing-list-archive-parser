I agree.  Your cost assesments will, however, be different for each 
individual StO method.  I was generalizing.

Well, if we adopt the method of comparing the cost of implementing a 
given steganography method to the cost of breaking it as a valid measure of 
its effectiveness; then, it would make sense to "maximize" the cost of 
breaking it as a means of making the method more effective (ie. making 
the method more obscure would make it more effective).

The more difficult it is for one's opponent to extract the message, the 
more effective the method is.  Thus, "maximizing his difficulty" is a 
valid goal.  As I see it, this is a goal of most encryption systems.  To 
make decryption as difficult as possible, if not impossible (ie. maximum 
difficulty).

I am well aware of this.  I was not proposing the above goal as a
substitute, but an addition to the one you pointed out.

I am assuming that it will cost the opponent effort.  I have no 
statistics to show exactly how much effort it would cost him; as I 
believe it would be different in every individual case.  However, it is 
clear that the effort needed would increase.

I do not think you have understood _my_ essay.  My proposal was for a 
default, variable offset in certain steganography applications.  The 
benefit of this is obvious:  having no offset or a non-variable offset 
would make for generally poorer security; as, the effort required in 
figuring out where one's file is located is nonexistant.  Effort 
increases when a variable offset is implemented.

This need only be the case if the recipient keeps his recieved files 
(which were sent using the _default_ settings) in their original format.
Any compromise in security can be avoided if he resets the offset to a 
custom value.

Regularly encrypted files can be searched against random secret keys.
The effort involved in both is greater than not having to search at all.

If no offset, or a non-variable offset, is used than one's opponent 
wouldn't even have to try to recover the file!  That is why I only 
proposed a default offset, while pointing out that maximum security can 
only be achieved through custom offsets!

In my original post I made it clear that my proposal was an addition to, 
not a subsitition for, the goal you set.  Therefore, the ideal steganography 
program would make it impossible to guess that there is a message 
_as_well_as_ make it impossible to tell where the message is located.  
These functions are not mutually exclusive.

You proposed that a successful steganography program should hide the 
message in a file in such a way that one's opponent would have to guess 
about the existance of a message in that file.  I do not dispute that goal.  
I simply offer an additional one.  Let me give an example:

Steganography Program A hides data at no offset, with a 49% probability of 
hostile recognition.  This program would pass your proposed test.  
Because it offers no offset, successfull extraction of the data requires 
only X ammount of effort from one's opponent.

Steganography Program B hides data at a variable offset, with a 49% 
probability of hostile recognition.  This program would also pass your 
proposed test.  Because it offers a variable offset, successfull 
extraction of the data requires X+Y ammount of effort from one's opponent.

User C hides data in all 100 of his GIF files using Steganography Program A.

User D hides data in all 100 of his GIF files using Steganography Program B.

Opponent E searches through every GIF file of both user C and D.
He guesses that there is data in 49 files belonging to user C, and 49 
belonging to user D.  He successfully extracts the data from all 49 of 
user C's files, expending X ammount of effort.  Successfull extraction of 
user D's data, however, costs him X+Y effort.

As this is a hypothetical example, we may subsitute $1 for X ammount 
of effort, and $1 for Y ammount.  Successfull extraction of C's data 
would cost his opponent $1, while D's data would cost $2.  More 
realistically, substiture $10,000 for both X and Y; or $100,000; or 
$1,000,000.  Now, would you rather use?  Program A or B?

I, for one, would rather use B, realizing that both X and Y are unknown.
