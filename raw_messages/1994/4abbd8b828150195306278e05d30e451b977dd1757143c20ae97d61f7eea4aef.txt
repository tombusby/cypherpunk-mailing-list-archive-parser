Jay Freeman has informed me that the recent NYT article mentioned in
a talk.politics.crypto posting I quoted contained an obvious typo:
"9/12/94" instead of "2/12/94."

Ordinarily this would be of no consequence, but Jay points out--quite
properly--that I have a well-known penchant, not to be confused with
my well-known pynchont, for using fictional accounts of happenings for
satirical effect. The inclusion of a _future_ date was merely a typo,
not a hint at satire.

So, the article really did appear, or so said the talk.politics.crypto
article. (We out here on the beach have to visit our nearest bookstore
to actually get a copy of that there New York City paper.)

And today's Safire article, provided by Duncan Frissell, is a
compelling critique. Admiral Bobby must be really fuming now.
