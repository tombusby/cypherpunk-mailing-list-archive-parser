I am the MX and the site admin for linet.org.

You have a "user" remailer@utter.dis.org that is sending PGP messages
to entropy.linet.org!remailer

Can you please stop?

entropy.linet.org has not polled for almost 2 months, and I have not been
able to contact him.  I assume that he is down for good.

Thanks!
