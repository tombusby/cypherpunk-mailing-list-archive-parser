No, I mean that if it is desired to reorder with a batch of 10
messages (10 messages in, 10 messages out), then that's what one does,
whether it takes 10 minutes or 10 hours to get this many messages.

I think in my last paragraph above I made it clear that "random
delays" are a lose, generally, and that the "amount of reordering" is
what's needed.
