I think that most people forget that as soon as that sort of money enters the
banking system, it can be tracked.  "Wire $20K to XXX" presumes that that
$20K came from somewhere, and unless you're careful about where it came
from and where it's going, you could be buying yourself a whole lot of
unwanted attention, even if it's a prefectly legitimate transaction.  Coming
in with a suitcase full of money is bound to get you talked about, and writing
a check... well...

It's getting rather difficult to move large sums of money around nowadays if
it either enters or leaves the US banking system, and if it's a friendly
nation (which Canada is), if the Feds have a reason to look at you, an
international border isn't going to prove much of a drawback.
