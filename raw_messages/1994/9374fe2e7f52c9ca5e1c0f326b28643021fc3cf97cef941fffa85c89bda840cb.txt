Do me a favor, Uni: I want to assassinate you and all the other members
of your family.  Could you send me some powerful handguns and silencers?
Oh, and while you're at it, give me all of your addresses and precise
travel schedules for the next two weeks.  As an "amoralist," I'm sure you
won't put short term morality before my long-term goal.  Thanks.

I'll judge what I want to, OK?  What are you trying to do, _coerce_ me
into giving information to someone that I don't want to?

Hmm, sounds like you're telling us what to do.  And defining what "we" are,
to boot.  I'm many things besides "crypto non-challenged."  I'm an individual
and an individualist, not a cog with a particular static role in society,
which is apparently the way you'd like it.  If you ask me what the color of
the sky is, I can say "39" if I want.

Yeah, well it seems you were just as quick as the "bleeding heart liberals"
to scold others and impose your personal (a-)morality.  Typical.

No one was suppressing anything or in any way attempting to stop the flow
of information.  They were just expressing their opinions.  Just because
_you_ were unhappy with those opinions, that's no reason to hurl accusations
of censorship around.

I can refuse to give help to anyone I don't feel like helping, and if I feel
like giving him a piece of my mind in the process, that's my business and his.

Great, I've always wanted to be a simple input-output machine.

Pseudo-individualist Republican rubbish...
