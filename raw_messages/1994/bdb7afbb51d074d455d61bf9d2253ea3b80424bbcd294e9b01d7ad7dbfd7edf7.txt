To all users w/ access to Lynx, but not Mosaic:

I have reconfigured t-shirt.html to support Lynx.  Obviously, the gif
cannot be displayed on-screen directly by Lynx, but can now be downloaded
to your disk by Lynx.  At this point, you can use the gif viewer of your
choice to look at the images. 

The URL is the same:

(learning more and more about html)
