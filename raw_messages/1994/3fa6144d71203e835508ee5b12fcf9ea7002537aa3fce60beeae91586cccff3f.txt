I was reading Usenet this morning before breakfast and came
across a very interesting series of messages to the effect that a
polynomial exists which generates exactly the prime numbers as
its set of positive values.

Such polynomials exist, the article argued, not only for the
property of primeness but for any computable property on the
natural numbers and stem from some deep result involving the
Riemann Zeta function and Hilbert's 10th problem.

I wanted to save this thread but now I can't find it again.  If
someone else read the same thread, could they drop me some Email
with the subject of the thread and the name of the newsgroup.

Thanks.
