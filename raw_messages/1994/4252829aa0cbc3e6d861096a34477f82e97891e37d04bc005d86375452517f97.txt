I'd like to clarify something about the recent Cypherpunks Electronic Book 
that was posted:

In the table of contents, the listing for the program WinPGP26 could be 
misunderstood as coming from me; I'd like to state that I simply forwarded a 
copy of the program (in it's shareware version) - I am *not* it's author 
(t'were that it were so!).  The author is:

Christopher W. Geib
7605 Mt. Hood
Dayton, OH 45424

email: 72144.1426@compuserve.com

I *have* however, registered the program, and am quite pleased with it - the 
author is _very_ responsive to feedback from users.
