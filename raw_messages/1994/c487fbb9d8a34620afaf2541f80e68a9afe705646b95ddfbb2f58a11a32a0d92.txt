[1] Clipper Petition Tops 10,000 Mark

The electronic petition begun by CPSR to oppose Clipper has generated
well over 10,000 responses in two weeks.  The daily signature totals
continue to increase, currently running at almost 2,000 per day!

The number of people who have opposed Clipper already exceeds the
current estimated government orders for Clipper chips.

Other upcoming milestones:

   12,000  Number of computer networks connected to the Internet
   15,000  Estimated number of total lawful wiretaps, 1968-1994
   70,000  Anticipated number of Clipper purchases this year
 
More details on the petition are re-printed below, just in case you
haven't already forwarded a copy to every person and mailing list you
know.

[2] Safire Slams Clipper

For those of you who might have missed it, William Safire published a
very good essay on the Clipper proposal yesterday (February 14). We're
providing some excerpts here and recommend the piece in its entirety.
Let's hope Safire can do for Clipper what he did for Bobby Inman.


  Well-meaning law and intelligence officials, vainly seeking to 
  maintain their vanishing ability to eavesdrop, have come up with 
  a scheme that endangers the personal freedom of every American.

            *     *     *

  The "clipper chip" --- aptly named, as it clips the wings of
  individual liberty --- would encode, for Federal perusal whenever a 
  judge rubber-stamped a warrant, everything we say on a phone, 
  everything we write on a computer, every order we give to a shopping
  network or bank or 800 or 900 number, every electronic note we leave
  our spouses or dictate to our personal-digit-assistant genies.

  Add to that stack of intimate data the medical information derived
  from the national "health security card" Mr. Clinton proposes we all 
  carry. Combine it with the travel, shopping and credit data available 
  from all our plastic cards, along with psychological and student test 
  scores. Throw in the confidential tax returns, sealed divorce 
  proceedings, welfare records, field investigations for job 
  applications, raw files and C.I.A. dossiers available to the Feds, and 
  you have the individual citizen standing naked to the nosy bureaucrat.

            *     *     *

  The only people tap-able by American agents would be honest Americans
  --- or those crooked Americans dopey enough to buy American equipment 
  with the pre-compromised American code.  Subsequent laws to mandate the 
  F.B.I. bug in every transmitter would be as effective as today's laws 
  banning radar detectors.

            *     *     *

  Cash in your clipper chips, wiretappers:  you can't detect the crime
  wave of the future with those old earphones on.

[3] A Tough Question

During the briefing on February 4 at which the formal adoption of the
Escrowed Encryption Standard (aka Clipper) was announced, Mark Richards,
Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division,   was asked
the following hypothetical question:

  Suppose NSA goes to the key escrow agents and says, "We intercepted
  a Clipper-encrypted communication overseas.  No U.S. persons
  were parties, so the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act does
  not apply and we don't need a warrant."  How do the escrow
  agents determine whether or not to provide the keys?  Doesn't
  this create a huge loophole in the system?

Richards' response was that there would be "some" mechanism developed to
ensure that there would be no abuse of the key escrow system, but added
that any such procedures "might not be made public."  The response was
less than assuring.  The development of secret procedures for foreign
intelligence use of escrowed keys does nothing to assure the public of
the system's integrity.  It creates a very real possibility that the key
escrow system will be based upon nothing more than NSA's unilateral
representations concerning the circumstances of a particular
interception.

It was not at all apparent why these procedures couldn't be made public.
Like so much of the Clipper proposal, valid concerns are met with the
claim that "national security" precludes the disclosure of relevant
information.  This is why many of us believe this is a dangerous and
ill-advised way to design our civilian communications infrastructure.

[4] Clipper Facts: Definition of "Tesserea"

The Defense Department reportedly plans to employ the Clipper technology
in a device known as a "Tessera Card."  We checked the dictionary and
found the results to be kind of frightening:

  Terrerea n. Lat. (pl. tessereae).  Literally, "four-cornered".  Used
  to refer to four-legged tables, chairs, stools, etc.  Also, a single
  piece of mosaic tile; a single piece of a mosaic.  _Pol._: An identity
  chit or marker.  Tessereae were forced on conquered peoples and 
  domestic slaves by their Roman occupiers or owners.  Slaves or Gauls 
  who refused to accept a tesserea were branded or maimed as a form of 
  identification.

[5] Sign the Clipper Petition!

                Electronic Petition to Oppose Clipper
                      *Please Distribute Widely*

On January 24, many of the nation's leading experts in cryptography and
computer security wrote President Clinton and asked him to withdraw the
Clipper proposal.
  
The public response to the letter has been extremely favorable,
including coverage in the New York Times and numerous computer and
security trade magazines.

Many people have expressed interest in adding their names to the letter.
In  response to these requests, CPSR is organizing an Internet petition
drive to oppose the Clipper proposal.  We will deliver the signed
petition to the White House, complete with the names of all the people
who oppose Clipper.

To sign on to the letter, send a message to:

     Clipper.petition@cpsr.org

with the message "I oppose Clipper" (no quotes)

You will receive a return message confirming your vote.

Please distribute this announcement so that others may also express
their opposition to the Clipper proposal.
