For all of you who haven't heard of Penny Lane...it's in Boulder, on
*Pearl* street (frueidan slip there, Nate?).  This is about your last
chance to check out this place -- it's being booted so that we can have
another Starbuck's or some such.  Such is life in Boulder these days.
(Insert sanctimonious old-timer's sigh here).

If I can explain to my wife that one night I'm staying late thrashing up
the systems, the next I'm brewing beer with a friend, and the following 
I'm going to a cypherpunks meeting I'll be there.
