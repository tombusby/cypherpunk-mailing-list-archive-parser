Hi Everyone...

Just noticed a little 6 liner on page 10 of the Jan 10 edition of
Information Week Magazine:

Quoted from said magazine...

	The government's information superhighway team is finally
	coming together.  Commerce Secretary Ron Brown last week named
	the National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council.
	Members include Craig Fields, chairman of MCC; Mitch Kapor,
	chairman of the *Electronic_Frontier_Foundation* and
	co-creator of Lotus 1-2-3; nathan Myhrvold, senior VP for
	advanced technology at Microsoft; Bert Roberts, chairman of
	MCI; and John Sculley, former chairman of Apple.

End of Quoted text - Emphasis on EFF MINE!

I wasn't around in the beginning of January and didn't notice if you
guys had a discussion about this.  If so - sorry, otherwise -
interesting isn't it?

Keep up the great work everyone!
Chris
