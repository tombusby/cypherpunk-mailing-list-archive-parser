How did you subscribe in the first place? Cypherpunks-request@toad.com? 
Wouldn't it make sense to mail that to get off? (Not saying that you DID 
use the request address)

I don't blame the cypherpunk 'owner' NOT removing you. You post publicly 
to a list asking to be removed. You're not. So you mailbomb the 
list-owner? The fact that you weren't removed from the list (not going 
through the 'proper' channel) isn't an excuse to mailbomb the list.

Let me get this straight. In all the replies you received to your public 
removal requests, not ONE said where to send the request?
