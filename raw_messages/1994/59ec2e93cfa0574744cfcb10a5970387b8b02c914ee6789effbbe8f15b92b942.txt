L.>1) Any Illegal crypto programs could be removed from Internet in a
L.>matter of hours.

It might be a little hard to invade Findland, Slovenia, the Republic of 
China, Italy, etc. all within a few hours.

L.>2) Any Illegal crypto message sent via Internet could be analyzed
L.>as illegal and not delivered.

It might be hard to rewrite the TCP/IP protocols and get everyone to 
install the changes without anyone noticing.

L.>3) Anybody sending such messages would face fines or jail sentences.

If they were provably in the jurisdiction and you could tell they did it.

L.>4) Any government branch that took your computer could keep it for
L.>no reason (except we are investigating it) for a long time,
L.>practically until your trail and then maybe forfeit it.

If you and your computers were in the (same) jurisdiction.

L.>5) Users of Illegal crypto could be subject to other legal
L.>surveillance. (telephone, movements, dosscia etc.)

L.>6) In this state even if Illegal crypto was not a Felony you would
L.>probly receive probation on first offense, 6 months in county jail
L.>on second offense and 1 year on third and subsequent offenses. I
L.>have done 11 months in county jail and found it racialy enlightning

A real learning experience.
