There may be more than one way that MITM (meet in the middle) may be used
to attack Double block cyphers. I assume the following attack. You know
some block of plain-text P and corresponding cypher text C. You believe
that C = E(k, E(j, P)) where E(k, p) is the encypherment of p with key k.
D(k, E(k, p)) = p. You need to find keys k and j. Classic MITM is to
produce a file A with records: <k, E(k, P)> for each k, and file B with
records <j, D(j, C)> for each j. Sort both A and B on the second field.
Pass over the sorted files looking for a record from file A whose second
field is the same as a record in file B.

To substantially shorten the ammount of tape used by a factor 2^n at the
expense of evaluating C and D 2^n more often do the following:

For m from 0 to 2^n-1 Do
  Produce file A with records: <k, E(k, P)> for each k where
    (the right n bits of E(k, P)) = m. (discarding other records)
  Produce file B with records <j, D(j, C)> for each j where
    (the right n bits of D(j, C)) = m
  Sort files A and B on second field.
  Pass over files looking for records from A that match records from b in the
  second field.
Enddo.

This is still a daunting job and evaluating its magnitide requires several
assumptions. The most obvious is the cost of evaluating C and D. Next is
the cost of reading and writing tape.
