If a murderer tries to kill you and you have a gun, you will shoot
back, I assume, even if you use the same method as him.

I wish it were true. They were trying this for many years. We all thought
that Naziism will never come back because the lesson (WW II) was big enough.
But it didn't work as you can see in the news magazines. 

What do you believe, is it a good idea to publish software like PGP
if it is used by the Nazis to organize their work?

Untrue. In Germany, I can do the very same. And I do not get
sued by private party with lawyers who want to get some millions
of dollars. And whether you are allowed to open your Nazi editorial
depends on what you understand under "Nazi".

In this discussion "Nazi" is everything from an idea to settings buildings
on fire. If I say allow, they say I would allow killing people. If I forbid,
they say I forbid to publish ideas. Tell me what is "Nazi" in your argument.

Untrue. A press without freedom can't be good. And if your press is bad
and not interested in publishing anything real, then of course you don't
need to control it. But this is neither freedom nor quality.

I can publish everything about Cryptography and publish it everywhere
over the world.

I can publish newpapers with nude girls on the front. Is this possible
in your country?

As far as I know in your country a lot of things are controlled by
religious groups. Is this freedom?
