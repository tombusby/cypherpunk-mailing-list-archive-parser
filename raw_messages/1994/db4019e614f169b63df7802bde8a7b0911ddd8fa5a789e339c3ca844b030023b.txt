 While I'm waiting for IP (internet politics) to re-establish the
link between the WELL and toad.com, I thought I'd pass along an
idea for a product I call "One Time Pad Plus."

 Basically it would work like this; Thelma is looking to pass a
message to Louise, so she XOR's plaintext file A against random
byte file B producing ciphertext file C. Now since Thelma works for
an unethical company that like to read it's employee's E-mail,
she's in need of some "plausible deniability."

 Enter "One Time Pad Plus." Thelma now XOR's ciphertext file C with
"Safetext" file D (any typically company approved useless memo)
producing "pseudorandom" file E. She now copies random file B to
disc and sends it to Louise via secure sneakernet. Then she
performs a military grade wipe on A and B. Now she can send
ciphertext file C via company E-mail.

 If her message is intercepted, she has deniability, she can claim
she has read of hackers, cypherpunks, and other evils equipped with
packet sniffers, and being concerned about security is using
encryption. She can then produce "random" file E  and decrypt
ciphertext file C which will yield not A but D the company approved
useless memo.

 She is commended for her forsight and gets a handsome bonus (yeah
right!)
