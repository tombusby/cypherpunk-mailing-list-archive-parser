This is a prime example of Master Knight posting "private" e-mail to the 
list as a method of retaliation and ad hominem attack. Notice that he 
defames himself by being too lazy to change the "Subject" line. My sincere 
apology to the readers of this very active list. I will not reply 
publically to Master Knight any further as this entire thread is not 
within the list subject.
