What you say is reasonably correct, but you obviously don't agree with
or understand the hostility.  Free Thinkers, which include atheists
(weak, strong, ...), agnostics, church/state separatists, etc., are
sometimes hostile to religion because religion is hostile to them.

It constantly puts down those who don't believe and represents a
'dumbing' force in society, IMHO.

I try to be tolerant of religion, people's beliefs, etc., except when
they cause censorship or other perceived oppression to those I care
about.

And this from a thread on tolerance on the list!!!

The name 'Freethinker', BTW, comes from the fact that religion and
sometimes society wants to tell you what to think, what's real, what
you should be doing, etc.  A consious sentient being should be
deciding those things on its own.

Ack... followups to alt.atheism...
