C'punks,

Paul Ste. Marie offered an interesting suggestion to the use of
vital signs transmitted from wired cops:

    ... such a device would, when worn by an officer in
    court, essentially become a broadcast polygraph...

Tim May is correct that a "broadcast polygraph" is not planned by
Fleming and Co.  However, they do contemplate at least sampling
vital signs using their technology.

Since my opinion is that polygraphs are almost totally useless
for detecting deception, I think the same would apply in spades
to broadcast vital signs.  In addition, all that is planned for
the localizer is pulse and maybe blood pressure.  That's enough
to see if the officer is in trouble (or engaged in sexual
activity, by the way), but not enough to test his/her veracity.
