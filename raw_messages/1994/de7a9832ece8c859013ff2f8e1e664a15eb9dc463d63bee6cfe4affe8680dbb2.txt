US stocks are now traded overseas.  Non-residents of the US can execute
trades on US exchanges.  Learning to feel comfortable in different countries
and investing environments is very important for diversification even
without the independence it gives you.  Remember the one major advantage
that you have over the nation state -- you can move and it can't.

I have a family too.  We shipped the kids out first (so they would learn to
read and write).  They are very transnational these days.
