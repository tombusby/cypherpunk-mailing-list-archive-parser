This has little to do with being a politician and even less with being
a US politician.  People at all levels everywhere at all times are willing
to pay for what they perceive as additional security.

Look at the world around you.  Just before the USSR collapsed, they were
well on their way towards building a world class navy, to counter the
"US threat".  This was a huge investment.  Singapore is armed to the
teeth, what the hell, most of Southeast Asia is armed to the teeth.  What
do the Chinese need nuclear missiles for?

At a more prosaic level, people everywhere splash out on life insurance
policies.  The insurance salesman's patter is much the same as the
generals' line when talking to the politicians in Washington.  Everyone
everywhere will pay for what they perceive as security.
