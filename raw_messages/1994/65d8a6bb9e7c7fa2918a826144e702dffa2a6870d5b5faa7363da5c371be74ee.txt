Whoa... is this thing supposed to be a *game*, or a training school for 
net.guerilla.warfare? I may be a minority of one, but I'm not going to
risk *anything* by trying to hack mail systems, trace their logs, or 
spoof. Quite frankly, I can't be bothered - apart from a sort of 'James 
Bond' thrill, that sort of thing has no appeal whatsoever. Hopefully, I'm
just missing the point here, but I wonder how smart it is to advocate
'hacking net services' in a game that is supposed to introduce people to
strong crypto. Although it might not be very thrilling, my hope is that 
Mom and Pop Citizen will one day use PGP (or <insert-favorite-crypto-here>)
on their routine e-mail - they may never know or care about telnetting to
port Q-47, and I don't think that matters much. Be careful with the game;
don't overemphasize the cloak-and-dagger to the point that Average Citizen
gets spooked off strong crypto.

Don't take this as flame-bait, please; this just posting just hit me at
the right time to provoke a philosophical outburst. While it is fun for 
the cypherpunks to skulk around and spoof each other, we must not lose 
sight of a large segment of our intended audience - namely, those people
who might hop on the strong crypto bandwagon so long as the 'skullduggery'
factor does not get too high. I think there is a large market for crypto
services that is completely detached from the 'full blown' cypherpunk 
agenda of anonymity, remailers, untraceability, etc.
