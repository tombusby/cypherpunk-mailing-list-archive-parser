The Massachusetts Institute of Technology announces the distribution

PGP 2.5 strictly conforms to the conditions of the RSAREF 2.0 license
of March 16, 1994.  As permitted under its RSAREF license, MIT's

to consult the RSAREF 2.0 license included with the distribution to

This distribution of PGP 2.5, available in source code form, is
available only to users within the United States of America.  Use of
PGP 2.5 (and the included RSAREF 2.0) may be subject to export
control.  Questions concerning possible export restrictions on PGP 2.5
(and RSAREF 2.0) should be directed to the U.S. State Department's
Office of Defense Trade Controls.
