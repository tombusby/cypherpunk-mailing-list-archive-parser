This is from the Safe-Tcl list, which discusses a variant on tcl which
provides a "safe" subset of capabilities appropriate for letting incoming
mail bring in programs which can run autonomously on your computer.  I
mentioned this a few weeks ago and I've been on the list, although I haven't
looked at it in much detail.   Nathaniel Borenstein is very active in
the email community so this may turn out to be an influential technology.
He is using PGP to authenticate incoming messages and grant them more
privileges as appropriate:

> 1.  In your .safetclrc file, add the following: 
> 
> catch { 
>     global SafeTcl_Services 
>     set SafeTcl_Services(authentication) $env(PGP_SIGNATURE)

> This will ensure that SafeTcl_Services is set properly if the

> 2.  Configure your mail reading tool so that it understands

> 
> text/pgp; decode-pgp %s ; needsterminal 
> application/pgp; decode-pgp %s  mime; needsterminal; \ 
>     test=test %{format}  = mime 
> application/pgp; decode-pgp %s ; needsterminal 
> 
> and then installing the "decode-pgp" script on your search path.  That
> script is a twelve-line shell script: 
> 
> #!/bin/csh -f 
> set viewprog=cat 
> if ($#argv > 1) then 
>     set viewprog=metamail 
> endif 
> set prog="pgp" 
> set infile=$1 
> pgp $1 -o /tmp/outputfile.$$ |& tee /tmp/shotputfile.$$ 
> set PS=`grep "Good signature" /tmp/shotputfile.$$ | sed -e "s/Good
> signature from user//"` 
> setenv PGP_SIGNATURE "$PS" 
> $viewprog /tmp/outputfile.$$ 
> rm /tmp/*putfile.$$
