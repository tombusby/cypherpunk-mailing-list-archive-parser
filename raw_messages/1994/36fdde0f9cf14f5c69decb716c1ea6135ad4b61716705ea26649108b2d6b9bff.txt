I got your point from your first response.  The remaining 5 were not
necessary.  I do not continue to question this point.

But I might point out that companys doing business on the net might not
like having the details of their day to day transactions sniffable, as you
can build quite a good business intelligence profile from that type of
info.  As can the IRS, FBI, etc.  Nor would they appreciate being spoofed...

I strongly suggest you take another serious consideration of implementing
encryption *now* rather than later, as your current scheme is not
thorughly protecting the privacy of individuals or organizations until you
do.
