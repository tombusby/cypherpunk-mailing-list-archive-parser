    Subject: possible anti-mandatory-clipper constitutional angle?

    A government mandante for key-escrow encryption in all
    communication devices would be the information-age equivalent of
    the government requiring private citizens to quarter troups in
    their home.

While I agree with you as to the analogy, a big part of me says "so
what?".  A major court decision or constitutional amendment that
effectively says that electronic info is equivalent to info on paper
would go a long way toward rationalizing the situation, but basically
there's almost no precedent at all for saying that any civil liberties
are protected in the electronic realm and there's a reasonable amount
of precedent in the other direction.

I suspect that you'd have a lot of trouble convincing the
technologically ignorant that something electronic could be at all
like quartering troops in your home.

A big problem in general is that "the information-age equivalent"
isn't something that most people can (or choose to) see.
