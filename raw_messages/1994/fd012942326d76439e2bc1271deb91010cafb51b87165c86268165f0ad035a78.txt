I explained to a list manager about our problems regarding the source of
SQUISH and the system administrator that does not respond to requests to
deal with the problem.

>
>I would (1) trace down his office phone number (through nic whois or

>Internet connection, and that if he doesn't consent to handling this problem
>appropriately, you will seek to have his company disconnected from
>Internet based on that abrogation.
>
>If he doesn't succumb to that threat, I would then (2) phone thru his

>boss, and explain to the boss that you will be seeking to have his
>company's Internet connection ended due to the postmaster's
>irresponsibility in allowing an unstable person to wreak havoc on the
>worldwide computer network community.
>
>Now while it might be a pain to actually follow through on this threat, if
>you put enough of a poker face on what you say, the bluff might very well
>be enough at either step 1 or step 2.
>
>Good luck!  And I hope I don't have to deal with this problem!  (But if I
>do, I've outlined how I will proceed.)
