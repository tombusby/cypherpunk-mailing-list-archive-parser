Please feel free to identify the "ad hominem attack" to which you're
referring.  I _have_ questioned your claim to be an attorney, largely
because I do not believe that anyone could manage to pass a bar exam while
being so utterly ignorant of the basest rudiments of copyright law.

I found no logic in your postings.  This explains, I think, my inability to
follow it.  I suspect that there are other explanations for _your_
inability to follow, or respond to, _my_ assertions.

No!?  How is it, then, that _I_ can copy a movie legally from HBO but I
can't legally sell the tape to you, eh?

None of which has anything, specifically, to do with copyright.

Do you understand the concept of "intellectual property" in the least?

Are you absolutely, positively, thoroughly _certain_ you're a lawyer?

(Hey, can I repost that private email you sent me?  I'm sure the list would
_love_ to see so deeply reasoned and clearly thought out an argument. 
Besides, you don't believe that it's copyrighted, do you?)
