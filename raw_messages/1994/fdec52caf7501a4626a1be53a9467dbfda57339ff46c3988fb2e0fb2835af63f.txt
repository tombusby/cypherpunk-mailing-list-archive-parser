You leave me wondering what you mean by ``bad people''.  As someone near
here (Eric?) is fond of reiterating, never attribute to malice that
which can adequately be explained by ignorance or stupidity.  Bad
people?  Well, maybe, but it's mostly ignorant-bad, not malicious-bad.

Yes.  This is the social ``cancer'' I mentioned, democratic political
government.

Talk with them.  Find that a decent, civilized Northridge resident uses
the earthquake as cover for replacing his carpeting at taxpayer expense
through FEMA assistance.  Find that a self-proclaimed tax resister holds
his rallys on a tax-funded picnic ground.  Find that an active patron of
free market educators lobbies in Washington for continued tariffs when
his business is threatened by imports.

Generally, find rampant gratuitous acceptance of the ``benefits'' of big
government, generating the demand that makes it bigger still.

Majority or not, the constituents strongly influence the bureaucrats.  A
good recent example familiar to readers of this list is the EFF with its
shrill and incessant campaign to all of us to pressure politicians to do
this or that.  Thanks to the EFF's efforts, proponents of government
surveillance can now claim the cooperation of a leading representative
of data communications users.  And the cypherpunks who are designing
privacy mechanisms will have new obstacles to overcome.

With constituents that adamant, it's no wonder that a bureaucracy grows
powerful.  When its budget is up for review, it need only point to the
clients clamoring at its door.

The social cancer would need to be cured.  It's hard to believe that
what would result would embed anything like ``government''.

Well, can you go a little ways?
