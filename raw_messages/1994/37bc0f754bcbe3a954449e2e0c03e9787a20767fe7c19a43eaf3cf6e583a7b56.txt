I am new to this list, so excuse me if this topic has already been
discussed,  but I think you need to take a 200 level course in economics
called Money and Banking.  I think the idea is so obsessed with tax-evasion
and privacy protection that you have ignored all the economic consequences
of the ideas you are proposing.

1) Who will insure your money ?  Can you trust anyone but the US gov't to
back your funds ?  Even in the S&L scandal the gov't refunded money to
people that weren't insured by the FDIC.  Do you think they would come to
the cypher-punk rescue if your money up and flew to Brazil ?

2)  A doctoral thesis could be written about this one, but what about the
Federal Reserve ?  You would wreak havoc on interest rates, inflation,
international balance of payments, and international trade.  How would this
electronic bank adjust for inflation or an expanding/shrinking electronic
money supply ?  Take a look at some historical texts that describe the
problems that the Early American Revolutionaries had in breaking from the
British Currency.  It took several failed efforts, and the currency of the
United States has been constatnly evolving ever since.

3) Interest Rates and Inflation ...

4) Interest Rates and Inflation ....

5) You guessed it, Interest Rates and Inflation.

What about Capital Markets ?
What about foreign labor unit exchanges?
Is mexican labor worth as much as US labor?

I think there are more economic issues than encryption issues to be
considered in this case.
