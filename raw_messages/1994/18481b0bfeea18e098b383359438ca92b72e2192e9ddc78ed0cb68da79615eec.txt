	I would have been impressed if they left out "intended." 
The above "testimony" is meaningless.  How is NIST supposed to know
what diabolical plans NSA/etc has in store for us.

	This is the same argument used for the Digital Telephony Bill.
That's MANDATORY . . it won't work if it's voluntary.

	Can companies believe the government's secret[obscure] crypto 
is safer than PGP or it's offspring? Why does the government feel
the need to spend all our money and provide us with inferior encryption? 
ANSWERS:  1] They're lying to us.
	  2] They have too much money..and we trust them to print it? 

It's too bad people, in general, believe what they hear, not what is done.
The Master Plan to hypnotize our nation [+the world?] into supporting
what they have not a clue about continues . . .
