Dear Colleagues;

Announcing the 3rd annual....

    George Leroy Detweiler
   Memorial Weenie Roast & Whale Exhibition

   MONDAY MAY 30, 1 PM - 1 AM        * R.S.V.P. *

This is our annual pool inauguration. We will be cooking/providing
limited quantities of Vienna Beef(tm) hot dogs from Chicago, Home-
made cajun hotlinks, South Carolina hotlinks, and some kielbasas;
The sausages will be plumped in the *cheapest* available beer and
then grilled in the time-honored way. We will provide some limited
quantities of snack foods.  For the vegetarian diners, we will
have some limited quantities of tofu-burgers & garden-burgers.

We should have back-up blenders & ice to insure that the we are
able to prepare sufficient quantities of Moo-moo drinks, lest we
feel the wrath of the Moo-moo gods. We will also provide condiments,
picnic gear, some ice for beverages, limited quantities of soft drinks,
cheap beer, wine and *good* beer.The pool will be heated as close
to body temperature as possible,and the tub will be operational.
The tub seats 6-8 regular-sizedpeople and 4-6 extraordinary people.
We'll have limited internet access at poolside for those with a
requirement for it. We will provide limited  crash space if required.

      towels for guests)

       bring it, someone else will want to taste it. Chips,Salads,etc.
