Somewhat easier, though.  And utilizing single-step defeats a lot of
debuggers too, who don't expect programs to use it.  The tool of choice
for killing such systems is an ICE, although most hackers do not have
access to these.

Exactly the point I made in the original article: the code to do the
decryption is vulnerable.

Ditto in my original article.

And it's not particularly secure, either.  There are well-known techniques
for defeating such approaches.  These are discussed in the CMU paper
I referred to.
