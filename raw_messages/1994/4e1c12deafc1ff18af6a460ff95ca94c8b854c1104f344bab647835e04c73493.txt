I thought the trick was to use a 'near-field' receiver.  I saw one at
the Dayton Hamvention a couple years ago for about $100.  It'd receive
Am audio or sync on FM (you'd here no-noise silence they said).

You don't tune it: it relies on the 'near-field' effect which is
something about how transmitters can induce the right harmonics in
a certain type floating receiver within a short distance.  The Rabbit
TV extender and a stereo TV decoder used the same method: they
sat on top of the TV and 'noticed' which channel you were on.
