  The idea of DigiCash is a good one, and there have been many good ideas
on it, but it will be hard to implement it in the US.  The IRS will want
to stop it cold as it gets around them, some people will fear it "The
cash for PEDOPHILES", and Joe Blow will probably have a tough time
getting used to it as it is very new to him.

Another problem is being able to trust the bank who holds the notes.  It
will have to be a stable institution which does this, one that the IRS
most likely has a grip on, or can get one.

The SEC will probably want their way also.

As to having PGP on a unix box, and the risks of this, I have a
solution to this.  What I do is keep my key on my Linux box at home,
and have my mail forwarded there.  It then is simple to reply and
decode messages.  pgpdaemon and pgpsendmail also help a lot with
the quick encodes and decodes.

As to tank rounds, aren't we getting a bit off track here?
