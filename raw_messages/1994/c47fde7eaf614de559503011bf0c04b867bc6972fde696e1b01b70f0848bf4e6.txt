Nat Borenstein is speaking nearby on Monday.
		   OPEN PROTOCOLS FOR INFORMATION COMMERCE
		    Nathaniel Borenstein, Chief Scientist
			 First Virtual Holdings Inc.

    Traditional one-way payment mechanisms, such as cash, credit cards,
    and digital cash, presuppose the necessity of payment validation in
    advance of the completion of a transaction.  In contrast, a "closed
    loop" protocol that verifies both payment information and customer
    satisfaction permits a far simpler payment engine in an open Internet
    environment, and is well-suited to a broad sub-class of Internet
    commerce applications.  In this talk, I will present the underlying
    philosophy, design rationale, and specification overview for a
    recently-developed set of open protocols for information commerce.
