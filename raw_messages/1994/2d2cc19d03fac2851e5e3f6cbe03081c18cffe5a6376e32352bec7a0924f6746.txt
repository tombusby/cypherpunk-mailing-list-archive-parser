Seen on news.admin.policy today...   Don't know if this affects any
other accounts he has at Colo State, e.g., detweile@cs.colostate.edu
(unless they are the same).

Yes, it was Detweiler.  I generously gave him some notice that his
account would be terminated; he went off the deep end and left a
process running overnight posting the Blacknet article to random
groups every 10 minutes.  About 120 copies went out before I could
put a stop to it.  Apologies for letting it go on so long.  Such
abuse will not continue from this site.
