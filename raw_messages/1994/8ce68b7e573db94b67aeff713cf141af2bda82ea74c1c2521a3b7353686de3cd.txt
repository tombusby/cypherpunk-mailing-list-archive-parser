Please don't take this as confrontational (ie, this is not a flame :-)

How would requiring that postings made to a list be verifyable be 
censorship?  What it does is verify that REAL people posted the message 
and that the person who's address is on the message is actually the person 
that posted it.

Now, granted, I suppose it could end up dumping some postings because 
they were forged, and that is sort of censoring.  But it isn't censoring 
based on content, but based on the fact that it appears to be a forgery.  
And by bouncing a message back to the person that posted it, you give 
them an opportunity to repost (this time signed) in case they forgot.

Also, as for the filter idea.  If some jerk is posting a message as 
appearing to come from schmuck@foo.bar.com, yes, I could add that address 
to my filter and delete it before i see it, but if the jerk starts 
posting as coming from idjit@bar.foo.com, I'd have to add another filter 
line.

By doing a check of the digital signature against the posters public key, 
you eliminate most instances of forgery.  Of course, if the poster's key 
is compromised, that's a different story.
