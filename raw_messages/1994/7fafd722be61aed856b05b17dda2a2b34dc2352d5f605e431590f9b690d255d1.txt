	Perhaps this is the problem?

	An nslookup for hacktic.nl at my site showed:
 
Non-authoritative answer:
hacktic.nl      preference = 50, mail exchanger = xs4all.hacktic.nl
hacktic.nl      preference = 100, mail exchanger = sun4nl.nl.net
Authoritative answers can be found from:
xs4all.hacktic.nl       inet address = 193.78.33.42
sun4nl.nl.net   inet address = 193.78.240.1
xs4some.hacktic.nl      inet address = 193.78.33.33
ns.nl.net       inet address = 193.78.240.1

	No mention of France there at all.

	You'll also note no bit of France in here.

	Why is this noteworthy, other than showing the IP number?
That number resolves to xs4all.hacktic.nl.

	I wouldn't like it either, if I was correct.  However, as
youv'e seen, that's simply not the case.
