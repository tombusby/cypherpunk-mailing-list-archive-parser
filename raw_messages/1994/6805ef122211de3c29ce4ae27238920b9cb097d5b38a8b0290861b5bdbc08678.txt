Perhaps something a little more useful would be a little more palatable.  
I have a feeling that something like the above would sound gratuitous to 
many on the list.  A better way would possibly be to have some 
value-added service offered by the list server which involves encryption 
or digital signatures.

Here are a few ideas:

1.  What if all messages on the list were themselves signed by 
"Cypherpunks List <cypherpunks@toad.com>"?  (yeah, I'm reaching here; let 
my brain warm up...)

2.  Encrypted submission to the list.  This could be useful if used in 
tandem with remailers, perhaps...

3.  Offer anonymization locally.  Messages posted this way could appear 
as "cypherpunks-reader@somewhere" or something like that.  When combined 
with remailers and encryption (like #2 above), this could mix things up 
with respect to anonymous mail.  As another (possible) option, the 
remailers could be set to recognize cypherpunks@toad.com and send in 
such a way as to use this local anonymizing.

4.  Auto-verify signed messages.  Put a header at the top of signed 
messages such as:

[Signature verified.  ID: Joe Blow <jblow@uunet.net>]
[Bad signature!  ID: Joe Blow <jblow@uunet.net>]

for tested signatures.  This would either require a key registry (where 
you register your public key with the list server) or an interface to the 
key servers.  This would of course imply quite a few changes to the list 
server code, as well as possibly non-trivial resources to do the 
processing, but hey, social imperatives don't have to answer to reality, 
now, do they?  (At least they never seem to when the government is 
concerned. :-)

Two variants: Strip the signatures after verifying them, and/or marking 
unsigned posts in a similar way.

5.  Allow the option to encrypt list messages before sending.  If we used 
#4 above, this could encrypt with the public keys; otherwise, it could 
use conventional encryption.  This could be a great boon to readers whose 
sysadmins might take a dim view of them reading such an antisocial list. 
:-)  Corollary: allow the option of sending the list, encrypted, through 
the remailers as well without requiring a pseudonymous remailer.

I'm sure I could think of more lamebrained ideas given enough time and 
motivation. :-)

I would agree, though I would suggest that holding out carrots (neat 
features you can take advantage of if you encrypt) would work better than 
punishments (your posts won't get through as fast if you don't sign your 
posts).  Does that make me a Puller?

This post is. :-)  I'm a believer that it serves as effective spoof 
insurance.  But, then again, I've got a direct Ethernet link to the net 
on my Windows box at work and Linux at home, so it's easy for me.

Also, I wasn't even a lurker at that time, so my suggestions may be old
hat.  If so, please bonk lightly!
